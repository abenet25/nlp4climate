the life and health of billions of people is endangered by climate change today,academic
life expectancy is generally used as the best metric for assessing the population health status of a nation,academic
against this backdrop this paper investigates the effect of climate change on life expectancy using the panel data model,academic
to do so imprimis this paper develops a conceptual framework linking direct and indirect pathways by which climate change affects health,academic
the direct pathways are through weather variables and natural disasters,academic
the indirect pathways are mediated through economic systems and ecosystems,academic
then this paper estimates the effect of climate change on life expectancy using cross national data from 191 countries covering the period 1940 2020 and employing the fixed effect method,academic
the finding of this study suggests that if the annual average temperature increases by 1 c then the life expectancy at birth will decline by 0,academic
moreover the temperature rise will further negatively impact life expectancy by interacting with the rainfall cycle,academic
if the composite climate change index an index of the geometric mean of temperature and rainfall increases by 10 points the life expectancy at birth will decline by 0,academic
moreover climate change will disproportionately reduce the life expectancy of females more than the life expectancy of males,academic
a negative relationship between a composite climate change index and life expectancy underscores the urgency of addressing climate change as a public health crisis,academic
mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changing conditions are essential to minimize the health risks associated with climate change,academic
thus countries should come forward with prompt initiatives to contain global temperature rise and protect the health of the population on the verge of climate change,academic
this study aims to determine the impact of surface temperature change considered a proxy for climate change in the united kingdom on life expectancy using annual data from 1990 2021,academic
government expenditure is used as a control variable,academic
the fourier function based bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag model is utilized to examine the cointegration among variables,academic
the analysis outcomes reveal a long term relationship between life expectancy surface temperature change and government expenditure,academic
furthermore the findings reveal that surface temperature change significantly reduces life expectancy in the long run while there is no significant relationship between the two variables in the short term,academic
the toda yamamoto causality analysis results show a unidirectional causality relationship between surface temperature change and life expectancy,academic
additionally a significant bidirectional causality relationship is found between life expectancy and government expenditure,academic
geographical environment and climate change are basic factors for spatial fluctuations in the global distribution of air pollutants,academic
against the background of global climate change further investigation is needed on how meteorological characteristics and complex geographical environment variations can drive spatial air pollution variations,academic
this study analyzed the response of air pollutant emissions to climate change and the potential effects of air pollutant emissions on human health by integrating the air pollutant emission simulation model gains with 3 versions and cmip5,academic
the mechanism by which meteorological characteristics and geographical matrices can drive air pollution based on monitoring data at the site scale was also examined,academic
we found the total global emission of major air pollutants increased 1,academic
32 times during 1970 2010,academic
air pollutant emissions will increase 2,academic
89 and 4,academic
11 in china and developed countries when the scenario of only maximum technically feasible reductions is performed v4a during 2020 2050,academic
however it will decrease 19,academic
33 and 6,academic
78 respectively by taking the v5a climate scenario into consideration and precipitation variation will contribute more to such change especially in china,academic
locally the air circulation mode that is dominated by local geographical matrices and meteorological characteristics jointly affect the dilution and diffusion of air pollutants,academic
therefore natural conditions such as climate changes meteorological characteristics and topography play an important role in spatial air pollutant emissions and fluctuations and must be given more attention in the processes of air pollution control policy making,academic
research has shown that air pollution and climate change affect both the duration and quality of sleep threatens physical and mental health especially through respiratory cardiovascular and nervous systems and shortens life expectancy,academic
this review will begin with overall information on air pollution climate change and sleep,academic
then it will proceed with the effects of these two environmental issues on sleep in the light of previous research,academic
during the last covid 19 pandemic 333 188 people died in mexico when analyzing the behavior of the pandemic it was found that the risk of dying when infected was related to their previous medical conditions such as degenerative diseases research was also carried out that linked them to their gender age work and school condition,academic
so far no analysis has been carried out linking people who have died from covid 19 to social marginalization or vulnerability to climate change,academic
this research arises from the question how is environmental vulnerability related as a factor that influenced the death of people who were infected by covid 19 in mexico during the pandemic in the years 2020 to 2023,academic
in order to answer this research question it is hypothesized that vulnerability to climate change is a factor that negatively affects the life expectancy of people who were infected by covid 19 in mexico,academic
the objective is to make visible how environmental deterioration has a negative impact on people s health as well as on the emergence of new pathogens which increases the deaths of people infected by covid 19,academic
in order to demonstrate this research assumption an analysis of variance was carried out by relating the variable of people who died during the pandemic with the conditions of municipal vulnerability to global climate change,academic
the south central states of the mexican republic of puebla morelos guerrero state of mexico and mexico city were selected,academic
it was found that environmental vulnerability has a negative impact on the life expectancy of people who were infected so if the municipality where the deceased person lived has a greater vulnerability to climate change there was a greater probability of death,academic
that is why environmental justice actions must be carried out to reduce vulnerability to cc,academic
background climate change is a health emergency,academic
each year it is estimated to cost more than 230 million years of life expectancy with 4 9 million premature deaths associated with air pollution and 9 million excess deaths due to non optimal temperatures representing 7 more temperature related deaths since 2015 and 66 more since 2000,academic

population aging urbanization and life expectancy are among the main pillars of sustainable economic social and environmental development of the future as outlined by the sustainable development goals sdgs of the united nations,academic
globally the current population structure exhibits an increasing proportion of the elderly along with rising healthcare costs and climate change,academic
malaysia faces a similar experience where 14 of its population is expected to account for the elderly by 2030,academic
to achieve the sdgs attention should be given to their pillars namely life expectancy health expenditure economic development and carbon emissions,academic
limited research that addresses these key factors has been conducted especially in emerging economies such as malaysia,academic
therefore this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by analyzing the long term and short term relationships between carbon emissions gdp health expenditure and life expectancy in malaysia,academic
the autoregressive distributed lag ardl bounds cointegration test was adopted to determine the long term and short term effects on life expectancy from 1997 to 2021,academic
the findings indicate that cointegration existed among the variables and carbon emissions and health expenditure had a statistically significant relationship with life expectancy in the short run,academic
hence greater attention should be paid to these two factors particularly in the short term to ensure that malaysia can maintain the health and well being of the nation in line with the sdg requirements,academic
as a consequence of climate change and its negative impacts on the environment and on human health the topic of sustainability has become an integral part of urban policy,academic
smart city initiatives around the world are focusing on different aspects of sustainability in order to provide better living conditions for their residents,academic
the aim of this study is to investigate the impact of selected smart city indicators on the average life expectancy as a variable for quality of life and well being,academic
based on a common correlated effects cce model instrumental variable estimator with common factors 2siv and clustering regression model eu countries were divided into three distinct clusters indicating common elements but also specificities of each group,academic
the analysis confirmed the positive impact of gdp growth renewable energy consumption and the proportion of the population with a tertiary level of education on life expectancy,academic
on the other hand co2 emissions and transport pollution have an adverse effect,academic
the analysis provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between smart city variables and quality of life and it may serve as a basis for informed and responsible decision making by relevant urban stakeholders aimed at designing more sustainable resilient and healthier cities,academic
water quality degradation has turned out to be of crucial importance due to various factors over the past decade,academic
pollution climate change and population growth are the factors that affect water quality,academic
contaminations such as microorganisms heavy metals and excessive nitrogen and phosphorous disrupt water ph levels posing significant health risks,academic
despite the innovation in the internet of things iot allowing balancing the ph by adding chlorine and fluoride after the disinfection step several security issues e,academic
distributed denial of service data manipulation and session hijacking manoeuvre the operational performance of the water treatment plants,academic
this causes people to consume polluted water which has many adverse effects on human health and reduces life expectancy,academic
to address this critical concern we propose a novel approach integrating artificial intelligence ai and blockchain technology into water treatment plant management,academic
our methodology utilizes a standard water quality dataset which has features such as ph and total hardness which is used for binary classification indicating water as potable or not potable,academic
we employ various ai classifiers such as stochastic gradient descent classifier sgdc decision tree dt naive bayes nb k nearest neighbours knn and logistic regression lr,academic
furthermore an interplanetary file system ipfs based public blockchain is integrated to resist the data manipulation attack where the potable water sample is securely stored in the blockchain s immutable ledger,academic
the proposed model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as confusion matrix analysis learning curve assessment training accuracy and blockchain scalability,academic
notably the dt model emerges as the best performing classifier with an accuracy of 99,academic
41 and scalability of 35 with 120 data transactions,academic
life expectancy lex is an important indicator of the general health status and quality of life of a country,academic
it is directly related to factors such as the effectiveness of a country s health policies and the level of social and economic welfare,academic
carbon dioxide co2 emissions are one of the key causes of global climate change and have direct negative impacts on human health through air pollution,academic
many studies in the literature have revealed that high co2 emissions have negative effects on health and reduce life expectancy,academic
this study probably the first of its kind in azerbaijan was analyzed using data for the period 1974 2022,academic
the stationarity of the variables was tested with nonlinear unit root tests such as kss sollis and kruse and it was found that they were not stationary at the level,academic
the existence of a cointegration relationship between the variables was determined through the a ardl method,academic
based on the results obtained from ccr and fmols method a 1 increase in co2 leads to a 0,academic
15 decrease in lex,academic
in addition the results of the fty causality test revealed that there is unidirectional causality from co2 to lex,academic
the goal of this study is to examine the association between in utero drought exposure and epigenetic age acceleration eaa in a global climate change hot spot,academic
calculations of eaa in adults using dna methylation have been found to accurately predict chronic disease and longevity,academic
however fewer studies have examined eaa in children and drought exposure in utero has not been investigated,academic
additionally studies of eaa in low income countries with diverse populations are rare,academic
we assess eaa using epigenetic clocks and two dnam based pace of aging measurements from whole saliva samples in 104 drought exposed children and 109 same sex sibling controls in northern kenya,academic
we find a positive association between in utero drought exposure and eaa in two epigenetic clocks hannum s and grimage and a negative association in the dnam based telomere length dnamtl clock,academic
the combined impact of drought s multiple deleterious stressors may reduce overall life expectancy through accelerated epigenetic aging,academic
climate change risk assessment studies focus on identifying and analyzing different risks considering several climate change scenarios and on evaluating the cost effectiveness of different adaptation measures,academic
however risk acceptability is often not reflected on in the context of climate change risk studies,academic
noting that the different climate change scenarios depict drastically contrasting images of the future in terms of population growth economic development and changes to life expectancy this article uses risk acceptance criteria that are based on socioeconomic considerations to highlight the need for nonuniform risk acceptability across climate change scenarios,academic
for this purpose the optimum implied cost of averting a fatality derived based on the life quality index concept and the value of a quality adjusted life year derived based on the time principle of acceptable life risk are assessed in three different climate change scenarios for sweden,academic
additionally an illustrative example that assesses the acceptable probability of failure of a steel rod under axial tension in the different climate change scenarios is presented,academic
it is shown that risk acceptance criteria can vary considerably across the different climate change scenarios e,academic
more than 190 variation in the acceptable probability of failure for sweden in the considered example,academic
this article demonstrates that the ability of societies to afford risk reducing measures may vary considerably across the different climate change scenarios,academic
hence it can be concluded that 1 in the context of climate change risk assessments risk acceptance criteria need to be developed to account for the different climate change scenarios and 2 these criteria may vary considerably across the different climate change scenarios,academic
finally relevant challenges and research needs are also provided,academic
the phenomenon of climate change is impacting the planet with notable effect,academic
polar ice is melting ocean levels are rising daily temperatures are increasing forest fires are burning longer and destroying more residential areas and urban air quality levels are deteriorating,academic
at the same time human health is experiencing the effects of exposure to changing climate,academic
research has indicated that extreme climactic conditions can shorten life expectancy and impact cardias respiratory and mental health as well as facilitating the spread of some infectious diseases,academic
the health related impacts of climate change merit serious attention in the patient and provider communities,academic
opportunities to effectuate meaningful changes are examined,academic
most contemporary mortality models rely on extrapolating trends or past events,academic
however population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate change notably the influence of temperatures on mortality,academic
in this paper we introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected mortality using a multi population mortality model,academic
this method combines a stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model predicting mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations be it excesses or insufficiencies,academic
the significance of this approach lies in its ability to disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional mortality models,academic
we illustrate this proposed mortality model using french data stratified by gender focusing on past temperatures and mortality,academic
utilizing climate model predictions across various ipcc scenarios we investigate gains and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality induced by extreme heatwaves and quantify them by assessing this new risk factor in prediction intervals,academic
furthermore we analyze the geographical differences across the metropolitan france,academic
this paper examines the effect of climate change on health outcomes in sub saharan africa ssa,academic
greenhouse gas emission was used as the measure of climate change while life expectancy rate was used as the measure of health outcomes,academic
this paper s significant contribution is how the interaction of climate change and government effectiveness index influence health outcomes in ssa,academic
we estimated the impact of climate change on health outcomes using the panel system generalized method of moments gmm method,academic
our empirical result show that there is a negative and significant relationship between climate change and life expectancy in the short and long run,academic
in addition we find that if effective government policy is interacted with climate change this mutes the negative impact of climate change on health outcomes in ssa,academic
this implies that with effective government policies targeted toward achieving net zero carbon emission climate change is not expected to have a significant impact on health outcomes in ssa,academic
if the world follows a business as usual pathway in relation to the climate emergency a child born today will face a world that is on average 4 c warmer by their 71st birthday putting their health under threat at every stage of their lives a global report on health and climate change has warned,academic
1 as temperatures rise harvests will shrink threatening food security and driving up food prices in the decades ahead said the lancet countdown report,academic
infants and small children will be among the worst affected by malnutrition and related health problems such as stunted growth weak immune systems and long term developmental problems,academic

purposethe purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of flood occurrence on mortality rate and life expectancy amongst 53 african countries,academic
design methodology approachthe study utilizes panel data from the period 2000 2018 on 53 african countries and system generalized method of moments system gmm for the analysis,academic
findingsthe result indicates that flood occurrence causes the destruction of health facilities and the spread of diseases which reduces life expectancy,academic
in addition flood occurrence increases mortality rate amongst 53 african countries,academic
research limitations implicationspractical implicationsthe study recommends that governments amongst african countries should implement strategies being enshrined in conference of parties cop 2021 on climate change,academic
this will help to reduce the level of climate change and flood occurrence,academic
originality valueprevious studies focussed on the adverse effect of flood occurrence without considering the issue of life expectancy amongst african countries,academic
this study contributes to existing empirical studies by examining the effect of flood occurrence on mortality rate and life expectancy amongst african countries,academic

air pollution is a growing concern in india and its adverse health effects are well documented,academic
climate change is likely to exacerbate this problem by altering weather patterns and increasing the frequency and severity of extreme events,academic
this paper examines the potential impact of climate change on ambient air pollution in india and its implications for policy design,academic
our analysis reveals that pollution in india is highly sensitive to variation in weather particularly in the densely populated indus gangetic plain,academic
using our estimated relationship between weather and pollution we predict that changing weather patterns will increase average pm2,academic
5 concentrations by 3,academic
1 µg m3 leading to a loss of 364 million years of life expectancy,academic
to address this challenge we propose an emissions fee calibrated to be highest in regions most vulnerable to persistently high levels of pollution and most sensitive to future deterioration in air quality due to climate change,academic
despite massive global economic growth and advances in science and medicine with spectacular aggregate and individual improvements in health and life expectancy over the past century the world has now become severely unstable in multiple domains biological sociological political ecological economic and health care,academic
these pervasive instabilities are organically interactive within a complex world system that has reached crisis status at local global and planetary levels,academic
lying at the heart of this complex crisis are long neglected disparities in health and well being within and between countries the refusal to face how these and climate change have arisen and how economic considerations have fuelled the trend towards entropy gradual decline of the planet into disorder,academic
the critical point we have reached starkly highlighted by the emergence of the covid 19 pandemic pari passu with ongoing climate change and planetary degradation reminds us of our global interconnectedness with each other and with nature,academic
comprehending and acknowledging the myriad humanly constructed forces in each of these domains influencing all aspects of life are the first steps towards effectively facing challenges to our health our humanity collectivity as humans and our planet,academic
overcoming denial acknowledging the magnitude and complexity of these challenges prescient vision and dedicated action capable of fostering the cooperation for overcoming obstacles are now vital to seeking peaceful pathways towards more equitable and sustainable lives,academic
south africa is a microcosm of the world with its local threats and challenges mirroring the global,academic
significance instabilities that pervade the world highlighted by the covid 19 pandemic are especially significant for south africa where they manifest most starkly because of its apartheid legacy its relative success economically on the african continent and the implications of ongoing widening disparities and antagonism amongst south africa s diverse people,academic
belief in moving towards narrowing wide disparities through decolonisation and reversion to an idyllic african heritage via a transformation that includes widespread corruption and the anc government s perverse erosion of lives today and in the future through state capture intensifies rather than ameliorates our predicament in an era when cooperation and a clear vision of current threats and future possibilities are desperately needed,academic
in an accompanying article potential pathways towards a better future are offered through suggested shifts in paradigms of thought and action,academic
climate change has among others impacts on human health and by consequence on healthcare systems,academic
some impacts are direct such as extreme events air pollution and aeroallergens and some are indirect such as reduced food production and supply vector borne and water borne infectious diseases and social and economic disruptions,academic
the main aim of this paper is to study the pressures of climate change on national healthcare systems,academic
an empirical dynamic resource allocation problem is proposed to estimate how healthcare systems may be affected by climate change,academic
the problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming model which finds the optimal allocation of healthcare resources that compensate for life expectancy reductions due to climate change,academic
we examine various scenarios of climate impacts to estimate the additional budget and healthcare resources needed,academic
the results show that the necessary healthcare budget grows nonlinearly with respect to impacts with disproportional demands on lower income countries,academic
finally the necessary healthcare investments should be made sooner as climate impacts become heavier,academic
our methodology could aid policy makers in prioritizing measures to enhance the climate resilience of national healthcare systems,academic
the united nations report also highlights that life expectancy at birth is rising and is projected to continue rising predicting that by 2050 the global mean lifespan will be about 77 years,academic
3 in the past few decades population aging has become widespread whereas historically it was localized to a few geographic areas such as japan and europe,academic
2 today aging populations in east and southeast asia latin america and the caribbean australia and new zealand and europe and north america are driving the phenomenon of global population aging,academic
3 of course aging is a normal physiologic process,academic
there are numerous changes that occur as people age including changes to body fat distribution and thermoregulatory mechanisms as well as a general slowing of metabolism,academic
as we age we also experience the combined effects of various insults to our health over our lifespan which for some result in disease or illness,academic
noncommunicable diseases are common in the elderly population representing globally approximately 426 million disability adjusted life years lost among those older than 70 in 2019,academic
4 not surprisingly in highincome countries polypharmacy also increases as humans age 5 further increasing the risk of adverse health effects,academic
in addition as people age their social capital might decrease as they leave the work force and they might lose family members and peers or increase their dependence on others,academic
the death of industrial civilization explains how the contemporary ecological crisis within industrial society is caused by the values inherent in unlimited economic growth and competitive materialism,academic
it demonstrates the central role and importance of electricity and what policy makers need to do in order to ensure that current and future systems remain reliable even as they are transformed by the rise of clean energy technologies,academic
the novel covid19 pandemic has created an unprecedented global health and economic crisis,academic
the result of such a scenario is that energy demand contracts by 6 the largest in 70 years in percentage terms and the largest ever in absolute terms,academic
the impact of covid19 on energy demand in 2020 would be more than seven times larger than the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on global energy demand and this is what the olduvai theory is defined by e energy production population,academic
it states that the life expectancy of industrial civilization is less than or equal to 100 years,academic
global climate change can impact populations rapidly through the increased occurrence of natural disasters and climate extremes but also through long term gradual changes that alter environmental conditions and impair biological processes,academic
here i investigate whether ambient temperatures in utero and during the early years of life are associated with reductions in life expectancy,academic
i combine monthly state level climatological data from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration with high resolution individual level mortality data from the censoc project which consists of cleaned and harmonized social security administration death records from 1988 2005,academic
results indicate that exposure to higher ambient temperatures during gestation and the first four years of life are associated with increased mortality risk in later life for white men from low socioeconomic status backgrounds but not other groups,academic
it is likely that the effect of climate variability on later life mortality for non white men is overshadowed by structural systems of racism that impact health stratification,academic
overall the results emphasize how climate change has already begun to imprint itself onto demographic processes,academic
recife is recognized as the 16th most vulnerable city to climate change in the world,academic
in addition the city has levels of air pollutants above the new limits proposed by the world health organization who in 2021,academic
in this sense the present study had two main objectives 1 to evaluate the health and economic benefits related to the reduction in mean annual concentrations of pm_10 and pm_2,academic
5 considering the new limits recommended by the who 15 µg m 3 pm_10 and 5 µg m 3 pm_2,academic
5 and 2 to simulate the behavior of these pollutants in scenarios with increased temperature 2 and 4 c using machine learning,academic
the averages of pm_2,academic
5 and pm_10 were above the limits recommended by the who,academic
the scenario simulating the reduction in these pollutants below the new who limits would avoid more than 130 deaths and 84 hospital admissions for respiratory or cardiovascular problems,academic
this represents a gain of 15,academic
2 months in life expectancy and a cost of almost 160 million dollars,academic
regarding the simulated temperature increase the most conservative 2 c and most drastic 4 c scenarios predict an increase of approximately 6,academic
5 and 15 respectively in the concentrations of pm_2,academic
5 and pm_10 with a progressive increase in deaths attributed to air pollution,academic
the study shows that the increase in temperature will have impacts on air particulate matter and health outcomes,academic
climate change mitigation and pollution control policies must be implemented for meeting new who air quality standards which may have health benefits,academic
the research aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change and water availability on the socio economic aspects and overall health of the population in aral district of kyzylorda region of the republic of kazakhstan,academic
the study focused on the following indicators demographic characteristics of fertility mortality total infant maternal natural population growth and life expectancy population health indicators disease incidence growth due to adverse ecology and harsh climate in 2005 2019,academic
in addition a sociological survey was conducted august 31 september 10 in 15 settlements inside the study area that included 120 people,academic
the survey aimed to collect feedback from the district residents on their general wellbeing and health status,academic
the questionnaires and survey allowed establishing that overall the residents in the study area were satisfied with their level of income did not associate their health condition with climate change and did not intend to migrate elsewhere,academic
in other words in aral district of kyzylorda region population migration occurs mainly due to the desire to obtain secondary and higher education as well as improve housing conditions,academic
the water supply in the study area showed no significant regression relation with climate change due to the installation of water pumps and delivery of drinking water by tank trucks,academic
the most important finding is that contrary to the initial hypothesis based on the survey outcomes the district demonstrated a stable increase in population due to births and immigration,academic
thus according to this study kazakhstan s section of the aral sea region manifests no catastrophic situation,academic
this paper analyzes the direct evidence of climate change in bolivia during the past 60 years and estimates how these changes have affected life expectancy and consumption levels for each of the 311 municipalities in bolivia,academic
contrary to the predictions of most general circulation models the evidence shows a consistent cooling trend of about 0,academic
2 c per decade over all highland areas slight and scattered evidence of warming in the lowlands and no systematic changes in precipitation,academic
the estimations indicate that the 1 c cooling experienced in the already cold highlands over the past five decades likely has reduced consumption possibilities by about 2 3 percent in these areas,academic
since the much richer population in the lowlands have benefitted slightly from recent climate change the simulations suggest that recent climate change has contributed to an increase in inequality and poverty in bolivia,academic
poor and indigenous peoples in the highlands are among the most severely affected populations,academic
no statistically significant effect on life expectancy was found,academic
the carbon intensity of well being ciwb a ratio measuring the amount of co2 emitted per unit of life expectancy at birth is an increasingly popular way to measure the ecological efficiency of nations,academic
although research demonstrates that economic development typically reduces this efficiency little research has explored the extent to which social equality improves it,academic
this study uses panel data for 70 nations between 1995 and 2013 to assess how various aspects of gender equality affect the ecological efficiency of nations,academic
we estimate a series of prais winsten regression models with panel corrected standard errors pcse to assess how increases in the percentage of women in parliament expected years of education for women and the percentage of women in the labor force independently affect ciwb,academic
our findings indicate that across all nations increases in the percentage of women in parliament and expected years of schooling reduce ciwb however increases in the percentage of women in the labor force increase ciwb,academic
our results further show that the relationship between different dimensions of gender equality and ciwb differs between more developed and less developed nations,academic
finally we find that increases in the number of women in parliament and women s education attenuate the relationship between women s labor force participation and ciwb,academic
we discuss the variation in our results by reviewing relevant eco gender literatures and feminist economics,academic
this paper analyses the dynamic relationship between economic growth renewable energy electricity consumption co2emissions and life expectancy for malawi during the period between 1980 and 2010,academic
unit root tests were conducted using augmented dickey fuller tests whereas zivot andrews test was used to check structural breaks within the data,academic
the gregory hansen cointegration test revealed that there was cointegration among the variables,academic
empirical results from the autoregressive distributive lag error correction model showed the existence of both long run and short run association among the variables,academic
today climate change is an inevitable reality,academic
malawi and other developing countries are faced with some sort of a dilemma,academic
on the one hand they have to achieve high economic growth which will depend on energy as one of its drivers,academic
on the other hand they need to ensure that they reduce usage of non renewable fossil fuels to maintain meaningful levels of carbon emissions in order to realize better health outcomes such as life expectancy,academic
this issue is important in this respect and according to the results obtained it has been revealed that there is a positive relationship between carbon emissions and the economy in the short term only,academic
furthermore the study findings showed that economic growth has positive and significant relationship with renewable energy electricity consumption and life expectancy in the long term,academic
despite low per capita emissions with over a billion population india is pivotal for climate change mitigation globally ranking as the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases,academic
we linked a previously published multidimensional population projection with emission projections from an integrated assessment model to quantify the localised i,academic
state level health benefits from reduced ambient fine particulate matter in india under global climate change mitigation scenarios in line with the paris agreement targets and national scenarios for maximum feasible air quality control,academic
we incorporated assumptions about future demographic urbanisation and epidemiological trends and accounted for model feedbacks,academic
our results indicate that compared to a business as usual scenario pursuit of aspirational climate change mitigation targets can avert up to 8,academic
0 million premature deaths and add up to 0,academic
7 years to life expectancy le at birth due to cleaner air by 2050,academic
combining aggressive climate change mitigation efforts with maximum feasible air quality control can add 1,academic
6 years to le,academic
holding demographic change constant we find that climate change mitigation and air quality control will contribute slightly more to increases in le in urban areas than in rural areas and in states with lower socio economic development,academic
as life expectancy rates continue to increase and fertility rates continue to decline globally in the 21st century the demographics of aging populations are undergoing an unprecedented change that will have significant consequences for the health outcomes of older adults at risk,academic
according to demographic data in a joint report authored by five federal agencies 8,academic
5 of the world s population is currently age 65 and older a figure projected to double by 2050,academic
this chapter presents an analysis of the impact of climate change on the health outcomes of aging populations worldwide,academic
it examines how the collaborative efforts of the federal government and the public health system can be utilized to create policies and programs that can prepare aging communities to deal effectively with the health consequences of our changing environment,academic
the behaviour of the valley glaciers of the italian alps as a result of the climate changes expected for the 21st century has been investigated,academic
from 1980 to 2017 the average length reductions of these glaciers has been 16 and their average areal reduction around 22 much smaller than the overall glacier retreat of the alps,academic
their mean observed shortening was about 500 m for a temperature increase of 1,academic
to quantify the valley glacier life expectancy a model estimating their length variations from the air temperature variations of the eurocordex climatological projections of six different models under rcp4,academic
5 and rcp8,academic
5 scenarios has been used,academic
the ensemble mean temperatures in the italian alps region under these scenarios indicate increases of temperature of 2 c and 4 c from 2018 to 2100 respectively,academic
in both scenarios the glacier model projections show a constant retreat until the eighties weakening towards the end of the century,academic
as expected it resulted more severe under the rcp8,academic
5 from 22 to 48 than under the rcp4,academic
5 from 10 to 25 scenario with a mean length shortening of 35 and 13 respectively by 2100,academic
the model used estimates that the majority of the valley glaciers could better resist the climate change,academic
measures to mitigate climate change are being considered all over the world,academic
reducing the use of air conditioners is one such measure,academic
while it seems to be effective in mitigating climate change it may also reduce individuals well being and increase the risk of heatstroke,academic
to compare the impact of reducing air conditioner use and the mortality risks the indicator loss of happy life expectancy lhple which measures the reduction in the length of life that individuals can spend happily was used,academic
the reduction in well being due to non use of air conditioners was obtained by applying the propensity score matching method to the results of a questionnaire,academic
we evaluated the impact of reducing air conditioner use in both the current and future situation in comparison to the mortality risk from flood and heatstroke respectively,academic
the increase in mortality risk due to flooding was estimated based on numerical simulation and the increase in the risk of mortality due to heatstroke was estimated based on existing reports in japan,academic
using these results the magnitude of the impacts on lhple caused by the reduction in well being due to the non use of an air conditioner and the increase in the mortality risks were compared both for the current situation and the future,academic
the results show that lhple due to non use of air conditioners was much greater than that due to the risk of mortality due to flood and heatstroke and implied that reducing air conditioner use is not necessarily a good way as a mitigation measure,academic
this result would be useful for creating and implementing measures to counter climate change and could also be applied in many other fields,academic
abstract the study provides data on the catch composition length weight relationship age structure gender structure growth maturation fecundity distribution and conservation status of the burbot lota lota linnaeus 1758 in bulgaria,academic
during six consecutive winters 2008 2014 a total of 395 burbot specimens were caught,academic
the total length and the weight of the specimens ranged from 16 to 51 cm and 29,academic
8 to 1057 g respectively,academic
seven age classes were represented 3 to 9 years old with 3 4 and 5 years old most abundant,academic
the maximal life expectancy was estimated as 12 years,academic
male female ratio was 1 1,academic
maturity happens at the age of four at the earliest valid for both sexes,academic
one quarter of the fish older than 5 years were determined as non reproducing in the particular year,academic
the absolute fecundity varied between 47 462 and 810 236 eggs for females ranging from 5 to 7 years old and from 25,academic
7 to 41,academic
5 cm in length,academic
a dramatic decrease of burbot population was observed in the last two decades,academic
warming water temperatures of the danube together with fragmentation in its tributaries are considered as the major threats affecting the species,academic
therefore the burbot in bulgaria is classified as endangered,academic
between 1950 and 2017 world average life expectancy increased from below 50 to above 70 while the fertility rate dropped from 5 to about 2,academic
we develop and calibrate an analytic climate economy model with overlapping generations to study the effect of such demographic change on capital markets and optimal climate policies,academic
our model replicates findings from the olg demography literature such as a rise in households savings and a declining rate of return to capital,academic
we also find that demographic change raises the social cost of carbon at 2020 from 28 euro tco2 in a model that abstracts from demography to 94 euro tco2 in our calibrated model,academic
generally the country and the population at risk experience the consequences of natural disasters differently and disproportionately,academic
likewise the negative impacts of the natural disaster on the population are not gender neutral,academic
this article explores the relationship of the negative consequences of natural disasters on the difference of gender gap in life expectancy in southeast asia,academic
using the regional data set over the period 1995 to 2011 we analyzed the influence of the natural disaster magnitude i,academic
number of disaster related casualties and the interaction with women s socioeconomic and political rights and the country s vulnerability and exposure to climate change impacts on the gender gap in life expectancy i,academic
ratio of female to male life expectancy,academic
the study produced three important findings,academic
first southeast asian women s life expectancy is more likely to decrease on average compared to that of men as the magnitude of natural disaster increases,academic
second lower women s socioeconomic and political conditions are associated with the gender difference in life expectancy as the magnitude of natural disaster increases,academic
lastly country s higher level of exposure and vulnerability to climate change impacts are associated with the negative influence of natural disasters on the women s life expectancy more than that of men,academic
taken together our study concluded that lower women s socioeconomic and political conditions as well as country s higher climate change related vulnerabilities are likely to pose a collective threat to women s overall well being more than that of men,academic
datasets spanning long periods of time are crucial to our understanding of a range of phenomena both within as outside social and economic history,academic
for various processes from social inequality to climate change only change gradually requiring long periods of time to observe and to explain change,academic
moreover data spanning longer periods of time help us to unravel causality issues in the processes we study,academic
finally time series data help us put contemporary phenomena in perspective,academic
abstract the turn of the twenty first century has borne witness to the seemingly relentless march of climate change with global mean temperatures and sea levels projected to rise significantly in the near future,academic
despite considerable improvements in healthcare mortality rates and life expectancy worldwide over the past few decades there is increasing evidence postulating the potentially adverse impacts of environmental alterations on health in more ways than one,academic
these not only involve direct and indirect climatic related health impacts but also those modulated by human aspects,academic
undeniably there is a pressing need to recognize these issues and come up with appropriate solutions to address them as much as possible,academic
fortunately this has led to the development of a wide range of measures encompassing both adaptation and mitigation strategies alongside the recent paris accords which highlight renewed global resolve in tackling these challenges in a collaborative and coordinated manner,academic
however progress has been relatively muted and whether these prove to be the turning point remains very much to be seen,academic
nonetheless taking the above into consideration there is little doubt about the gravity of the situation and that much more needs to be done to integrate and bring society forward in this new era,academic
economic and social development the world has experienced in the last couple of centuries has been unprecedented propelled by technological advances that have overcome famine and extended life expectancy in much of the world,academic
this has been reflected in productivity gains in agriculture industrial development advances in communications transport and energy never experienced in much of recorded history,academic
but this has brought increases in co2 emissions since the industrial age whose full implications are as yet somewhat unpredictable,academic
however an increasingly widespread consensus has emerged that there is the need to reverse these emissions to prevent global average temperature increases to less than 2 celsius,academic
the agreement reached by the 195 countries in climate talks in paris requires an overhaul of historic proportions for energy policies worldwide and investment of the order of 16,academic
5 trillion of spending on renewables and efficiency as well as carbon capture and storage through 2030 to meet the agreed targets outlined as estimated by the international energy agency,academic
in essence the deal aims at limiting global temperature increase since the industrial revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries to 2 degrees celsius 3,academic
6 degrees fahrenheit while calling on nations to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1,academic
the paris agreement provides a framework for such effort and will require significant reductions in hydrocarbons investments increases in emissions costs reduction in deforestation intensive reengineering of energy sources in use and profound changes in transport systems,academic
none of this will take place on its own or be politically economically and technically easy,academic
henceforth emphasis must focus on how to move from words to deeds in a manner that does not affect negatively economic development,academic
this article is focused on four areas that need special attention to ensure that future efforts can adequately address concerns of efficiency and effectiveness which have hitherto received scant attention with consequent limited progress and results in climate change actions,academic
as there are few precedents in this emerging area this article is based on benchmark analysis the author has conducted to assist several governments in designing policies to deal with the emerging issues climate change is posing,academic
background and objectives health outcomes such as survival minimal disability and well being are presumptively dependent on food and ecosystems,academic
an integral measure of the critical urban food system linkages to health problems is needed,academic
much of the current health change in cities could be attributed to short comings in food systems which can pose threats to food security and food safety,academic
health problems have needed a reconceptualisation of present medical and nutritional constructs,academic
methods and study design the present study is based on a situational analysis of food and the related ecosystems presumptively affected by rapid urbanisation in china,academic
with an ecological information matrix an urban food system index with ten indicators which could influence food system outcomes and promote health and well being has been developed,academic
it uses sixteen data sets from the national bureau of statistics for all 31 provinces in china,academic
the indicators were locality climate biodiversity infrastructure transport population structure livelihood recreation and socialisation personal security and communication,academic
the indicators for each province scored between 1 severe and 5 best were used to predict life expectancy for china as a whole by multivariable regression analysis,academic
results the best model explained 70 of the variance and had significant beta coefficients for population structure proportion of juveniles 0,academic
0001 and livelihood food expenditure 0,academic
conclusions population characteristics and livelihoods related to food systems can account for much of life expectancy as a health outcome,academic
an index which captured this in formation is provided and could evaluate concurrently as well as prospectively food system related health with urbanisation,academic
demographers predict human life expectancy will continue to increase over the coming century,academic
these forecasts are based on two critical assumptions advances in medical technology will continue apace and the environment that sustains us will remain unchanged,academic
the consensus of the scientific community is that human activity contributes to global climate change,academic
that change will degrade air and water quality and global temperature could rise 11,academic
5 f by 2100,academic
if nothing is done to alter this climatic trajectory humans will be confronted by a broad spectrum of radical environmental challenges,academic
historically children and the elderly adults account for most of the death toll during times of severe environmental stress,academic
this article makes an assessment from a geriatric viewpoint of the adverse health consequences that global climate change will bring to the older segments of future populations in the united states,academic
abstract this article focuses on the epidemic of childhood obesity a significant cause of pediatric morbidity in the united states,academic
it begins with a review of the evidence regarding environmental influences on obesity,academic
then it draws from that evidence to cite examples of climate change prevention and preparedness efforts that could also benefit the obesity problem,academic
climate change is a global environmental issue predicted to negatively impact children s health,academic
in the united states many regions are expected to experience worse air quality increased vector borne disease and changes in food availability,academic
children s size developmental stage and long life expectancy make them unique when considering health effects from the environment,academic
furthermore in the latter part of this century the children of today will become seniors a group also vulnerable to predicted health impacts from climate change,academic
these vulnerabilities will contribute to existing health disparities that are due in part to unequal risk,academic
the past 200 years have enabled remarkable increases in human lifespans through improvements in the living environment that have nearly eliminated infections as a cause of death through improved hygiene public health medicine and nutrition,academic
we argue that the limit to lifespan may be approaching,academic
since 1997 no one has exceeded jeanne calment s record of 122,academic
5 years despite an exponential increase of centenarians,academic
moreover the background mortality may be approaching a lower limit,academic
we calculate from gompertz coefficients that further increases in longevity to approach a life expectancy of 100 years in 21st century cohorts would require 50 slower mortality rate accelerations which would be a fundamental change in the rate of human aging,academic
looking into the 21st century we see further challenges to health and longevity from the continued burning of fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution as well as global warming,academic
besides increased heat waves to which elderly are vulnerable global warming is anticipated to increase ozone levels and facilitate the spread of pathogens,academic
we anticipate continuing socioeconomic disparities in life expectancy,academic
climate variability will increase with climate change and thus it is important for population ecologists to understand its consequences for population dynamics,academic
four components are known to mediate the consequences of climate variability the magnitude of climate variability the effect size of climate on vital rates covariance between vital rates and autocorrelation in climate,academic
recent studies have pointed to a potential fifth component vital rates responding to climate in different timeframes with some responding more immediately and some having lagged responses,academic
we use simulations to quantify how all five components modify the consequences of climatic variability on long term population growth rates across a range of life histories defined by life expectancy and iteroparity,academic
we use an established method to compose matrix population models for 147 life histories,academic
our simulations show that including different timeframes for vital rates responses to climate can either reduce or amplify the negative influence of climate variability on long term population growth rates,academic
the negative effect of different timeframes for vital rates responses on population growth is amplified when climatic autocorrelations are negative and when species are long lived,academic
the existing literature shows that vital rates often respond to climate in different timeframes and that studies often ignore climate autocorrelation,academic
our results show that simultaneously including both of these factors can substantially increase or decrease a population s expected growth rate,academic
moreover the relative magnitude of this change increases with the generation time of a life history,academic
our results are relevant to conservation population forecasts and population modelling in general,academic
how global warming affects human development is a central question for economists as well as social scientists,academic
while most of the literature has focused on the impact of weather on income less is known on the relationship between climate and local human development,academic
this paper considers shocks in precipitation temperature and an original measure of soil aridity to first exploit the association between climate warming and human development and second on its dimensions,academic
we show that while precipitations do not have a significant long term impact on human development growth variations in temperature and potential evapotranspiration negatively affect two of the three determinants of the human development index namely life expectancy at birth and education,academic
these results suggest that other climate indicators such as the potential evapo transpiration of the soil should be considered in addition to the standard indicators when evaluating the localized economic effects of climate change,academic
recent decades have witnessed the ageing of populations in many countries across the world accompanied by unprecedented social cultural and technological change as well as recognition of the implications of climate change,academic
as this demographic transformation has posed a full range of challenges to policy dimensions in certain countries the importance of older people being able to access appropriate learning opportunities has become more widely recognised,academic
increasingly it is understood that this is necessary not only for the economies of different countries which may require people to remain for longer in the labour market but also as an essential component of a fulfilling later life,academic
however a focus only on chronological age and ageing fails to allow for the more positive aspects of what may be termed the longevity effect which has been driven by a better understanding of the factors that influence increased life expectancy in different countries enabling people to live longer happier and more productive lives,academic
it is argued firstly that we need to rethink the current focus on aging and replace it with a more positive emphasis on longevity that includes an understanding of what happens to our brains as we grow older,academic
secondly the concept of long life learning which is beginning to appear in different contexts is explored,academic
thirdly it is acknowledged that the worldwide spread of covid 19 has both opened up some novel ways of helping some older people to learn and simultaneously widened the so called digital divide,academic
finally the pernicious influence of ageism is considered,academic
we examine the trends in healthy life years expectancy hlye at birth during the past few decades in europe,academic
we observe that several european countries show a significant drop in hlye at birth starting from 2003 interrupting what had been a previous continuous increase,academic
we discuss the possible causes of this drop including a possible correlation with climate change in terms of the heat wave experienced in europe in 2003,academic
it is not possible at present to propose a single explanation for this phenomenon however the trend is worrisome and its causes should be investigated further,academic
this paper assesses some welfare consequences of climate change mitigation policies,academic
in the same vein as becker philipson and soares 2005 a simple index of economic progress weighs in the monetary cost induced by mitigation policies as well as the health benefits arising from the reduction in local air pollution,academic
the shadow price of pollution is calculated indirectly through its impact on life expectancy,academic
taking into account the health benefits of mitigation policies significantly reduces their monetary cost in china and india as well as in countries with large fossil based energy producing sectors australia canada and the united states,academic
l impact des politiques d attenuation du changement climatique sur le bien etre economique cette etude evalue certaines consequences des politiques d attenuation du changement climatique sur le bien etre economique,academic
suivant l approche de becker philipson et soares 2005 un indice de progres economique est propose combinant le cout monetaire des politiques d abattement d emissions de gaz a effet de serre ainsi que les benefices pour la sante de la reduction de la pollution de l air qui en decoule,academic
le prix implicite de la pollution est calcule indirectement a travers son impact sur l esperance de vie,academic
la prise en compte des benefices sur la sante des politiques d attenuation reduit le cout monetaire de la lutte contre le changement climatique baisse de maniere significative en chine et en inde ainsi que dans le cas de pays a forte production d energie fossile l australie le canada et les etats unis,academic
the relationship between human health and well being energy use and carbon emissions is a foremost concern in sustainable development,academic
if past advances in well being have been accomplished only through increases in energy use there may be significant trade offs between achieving universal human development and mitigating climate change,academic
we test the explanatory power of economic dietary and modern energy factors in accounting for past improvements in life expectancy using a simple novel method functional dynamic decomposition,academic
we elucidate the paradox that a strong correlation between emissions and human development at one point in time does not imply that their dynamics are coupled in the long term,academic
increases in primary energy and carbon emissions can account for only a quarter of improvements in life expectancy but are closely tied to growth in income,academic
facing this carbon development paradox requires prioritizing human well being over economic growth,academic
this paper uses municipality level data to estimate the general relationship between climate income and life expectancy in chile,academic
the analysis finds that incomes are negatively related to temperature while life expectancy is not significantly related to average temperatures,academic
both incomes and life expectancy are greater in areas with either very little rain or a lot of rain,academic
the authors use the estimated relationships to simulate the effects of both past 1958 08 and future 2008 58 climate change,academic
the findings indicate that past climate change has been favorable for the central and most populous part of chile and it has contributed to reduced poverty and reduced inequality of health outcomes,academic
whereas temperatures in the past have shown a downward trend for most of the chilean population climate models suggest that they will increase in the future and that there will be a reduction in precipitation in the central part of chile,academic
the analysis simulates the likely effects of these projected climate changes over the next 50 years,academic
the findings suggest that expected future climate will tend to reduce incomes across the whole country with an average reduction of about 7 percent all other things equal,academic
this paper provides a critical review of the degradation durability and service life prediction slp of polymeric building envelope materials bems namely claddings air vapour barriers insulations sealants gaskets and fenestration,academic
the rate of material deterioration and properties determine the usefulness of a product therefore knowledge of the significant degradation mechanisms in play for bems is key to the design of proper slp methods,academic
slp seeks to estimate the life expectancy of a material component exposed to in service conditions,academic
this topic is especially important with respect to the potential impacts of climate change,academic
the surrounding environment of a building dictates the degradation mechanisms in play and as climate change progresses material aging conditions become more unpredictable,academic
this can result in unexpected changes and or damages to bems and shorter than expected sl,academic
the development of more comprehensive slp methods is economically and environmentally sound and it will provide more confidence comfort and safety to all building users,academic
the goal of this paper is to review the existing literature in order to identify the knowledge gaps and provide suggestions to address these gaps in light of the rapidly evolving climate,academic
this paper uses district level data to estimate the general relationship between climate income and life expectancy in peru,academic
the analysis finds that both incomes and life expectancy show hump shaped relationships with optimal average annual temperatures around 18 20oc,academic
these estimated relationships were used to simulate the likely effects of both past 1958 2008 and future 2008 2058 climate change,academic
at the aggregate level future climate change in peru is estimated to cause a small reduction in average life expectancy of about 0,academic
this average however hides much larger losses in the already hot areas as well as substantial gains in currently cold areas,academic
similarly the average impact on incomes is a modest reduction of 2,academic
3 percent but with some districts experiencing losses of up to 20 percent and others gains of up to 13 percent,academic
future climate change is estimated to cause an increase in poverty all other things equal but to have no significant effect on the distribution of incomes,academic
as the climate is changing and buildings are designed with a life expectancy of 50 years it is sensible to take climate change into account during the design phase,academic
data representing future weather are needed so that building performance simulations can predict the impact of climate change,academic
currently this usually requires one year of weather data with a temporal resolution of one hour which represents local climate conditions,academic
however both the temporal and spatial resolution of global climate models is generally too coarse,academic
two general approaches to increase the resolution of climate models statistical and dynamical downscaling have been developed,academic
they exist in many variants and modifications,academic
the present paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of future weather application as well as critical insights in the model and method selection,academic
the results indicate a general trend to select the simplest methods which often involves a compromise on selecting climate models,academic
it has been commonly observed that tropical countries typically suffer from intense corruption and underdevelopment,academic
i offer an explanation for this long standing disparity across the world based on variation in the intensity of ultraviolet radiation uv r,academic
the central idea of this paper holds that uv r is positively associated with the historical prevalence of eye diseases which significantly shortens work life expectancy as a skilled worker,academic
this arguably shapes the global pattern of corrupt practices,academic
interestingly this finding appears to be strong and insensitive to accounting for different theories explaining differences in corruption levels across the globe,academic
further analyses using individual level data taken from the world values survey and provincial level data for china lend strong credence to the cross country evidence,academic
undoubtedly the advent of antibiotics in the 19th century had a substantial impact increasing human life expectancy,academic
however a multitude of scientific investigations now indicate that we are currently experiencing a phase known as the post antibiotic era,academic
there is a genuine concern that we might regress to a time before antibiotics and confront widespread outbreaks of severe epidemic diseases particularly those caused by bacterial infections,academic
these investigations have demonstrated that epidemics thrive under environmental stressors such as climate change the depletion of natural resources and detrimental human activities such as wars conflicts antibiotic overuse and pollution,academic
moreover bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt and mutate,academic
unfortunately the current development of antibiotics is insufficient and the future appears grim unless we abandon our current approach of generating synthetic antibiotics that rapidly lose their effectiveness against multidrug resistant bacteria,academic
despite their vital role in modern medicine medicinal plants have served as the primary source of curative drugs since ancient times,academic
numerous scientific reports published over the past three decades suggest that medicinal plants could serve as a promising alternative to ineffective antibiotics in combating infectious diseases,academic
over the past few years phenolic compounds alkaloids saponins and terpenoids have exhibited noteworthy antibacterial potential primarily through membrane disruption mechanisms protein binding interference with intermediary metabolism anti quorum sensing and anti biofilm activity,academic
however to optimize their utilization as effective antibacterial drugs further advancements in omics technologies and network pharmacology will be required in order to identify optimal combinations among these compounds or in conjunction with antibiotics,academic
we present the techniques of qualitative analysis of complex communities and discuss the impact of climate change as a press perturbation,academic
in particular we focus on the difficult problem of disease and parasites embedded in animal communities notably zoonotic diseases,academic
climate change can potentially affect population densities of hosts and vectors as well as their life expectancy,academic
recent advances may provide insight in predicting change in risk of zoonotic disease following climate shifts,academic
we conclude that the impact of change on ecological communities can be profound but subtle complex and ambiguous even under basic mathematical assumptions about the structure of a community when in equilibrium,academic
many studies and scholars focus on the impact of climate change and pollution on economic green growth linked to cultural variables,academic
the discussed socio cultural factors are measured by world values surveys and environmental deterioration presented as different types of pollution are both independently essential for economic sustainability,academic
the article refers to the socio cultural index and sustainability,academic
environmental deterioration index as calculated by principal component analysis socio cultural index formed by culture dimensions most of them mentioned by hofstede 1980 such as masculinity individualism and power distance also social development and life expectancy and education level,academic
based on environmental kuznets curve there is a strong linkage among environmental degradation and income level,academic
this paper applies panel data by using generalized least square estimation due to the existence of heteroskedasticity and serial correlation validate by durbin watson test and breusch pagan test respectively,academic
the data was taken from world value surveys and european value surveys for hofstede dimensions world bank such as gdp per capita fdi life expectancy at birth tertiary school enrollment and land pollution and bp statistics of world energy for co2 over years 2000 2022,academic
the results show negative causal relationship between socio cultural and economic sustainability and a positive impact of environmental deterioration on economic,academic
disease and healing in the indus civilisation presents a synthesis of what is currently known about health disease and healing in the indus civilisation in the third to early second millennia bce underpinned by original research,academic
it is the result of a detailed study of published human skeletal remains and material culture with an increasing awareness of the natural environment,academic
when combined with a knowledge of palaeoepidemiology and the natural history of disease ancient climate change and what is known of healing and health in contemporary bronze age societies of the near east with which the indus civilisation was in contact it has been possible to piece together a picture of diseases in the period the practice of healing and the development of public health,academic
for the first time the book illustrates the health life expectancy and the illnesses and injuries from which those at the bottom of society suffered both at work and at home,academic
the human development index hdi has had positive dynamics since 1990 as an overall indicator for evaluating achievements in three basic dimensions of human development long and healthy life knowledge and a decent standard of living,academic
the challenges of recent years with short and long term consequences have changed the hdi trend,academic
the article based on the research of modern scientists and experts analyzes the reasons for the current trajectory of the human development index and identifies its potential trends,academic
the hypothesis of hysteresis as a new feature that determines the dynamics of the human development index became the starting point for analyzing the direct and indirect consequences of the components forming hysteresis,academic
the covid 19 pandemic creates the phenomenon of hysteresis about human development the intensification of military conflicts and climate change,academic
the covid 19 pandemic has led to the loss of human lives reduced life expectancy interrupted access to education and caused economic recession in the global economy,academic
the covid 19 pandemic caused an economic recession because of which the global gdp decreased incomes decreased and the trend toward a decrease in poverty level stopped against the background of a growing debt burden,academic
in addition to the direct effects of the covid 19 pandemic there has been an indirect impact on people s health deteriorating mental health due to isolation and domestic violence,academic
the escalation of military conflicts led to the death of people and an increase in the number of forcibly displaced persons the destruction of housing educational institutions and infrastructure facilities,academic
climate change has increased the risks of food insecurity and outbreaks of epidemics and the number of victims of natural disasters has increased,academic
the article states that undp experts see the causes of hysteresis in mismanagement an inadequate response to the covid 19 pandemic allowing military conflicts the consequences of which go beyond the borders of war torn countries insufficient efforts to mitigate the consequences of climate change,academic
the established hdi trend can be changed by a new outlook improved policies and institutions that will contribute to the production of global public goods,academic

this rapid evidence review explores the causes and consequences of air pollution in nepal focusing on particulate matter pm2,academic
5 and drawing from academic and grey literature,academic
while evidence is expanding there are geographical and thematic gaps notably with more studies conducted in kathmandu valley,academic
major causes include urbanisation vehicular emissions brick kilns and transboundary pollution,academic
health impacts are severe reducing life expectancy and causing cardiovascular and lung diseases with economic costs amounting to over 6 of gdp,academic
political and environmental dimensions are also crucial including impacts on education and tourism and the need for coordinated efforts to address both air quality and climate change,academic
humanity faces an unprecedented survival challenge climate change driven by the depletion of natural resources excessive waste generation and deforestation,academic
six out of nine planetary boundaries have been exceeded signaling that earth is far from a safe operating space for humanity,academic
in this viewpoint article we explore three critical atomic molecular challenges earth s limited atomic resources its oxidative nature and very rich chemistry,academic
addressing these requires a transformation in how we produce and consume emphasizing sustainable practices aligned with the united nations 17 goals,academic
the advancement of science and technology has extended human life expectancy and improved quality of life,academic
however to ensure a sustainable future we must move towards less oxidative chemical processes incorporate ch4 co2 redox chemistry into the circular economy and transition from a linear fossil fuel dependent economy to a circular bioeconomy,academic
reforestation and the recovery of degraded lands are essential alongside the shift towards green and sustainable chemistry,academic
earth s dynamic chemistry is governed by the principles of thermodynamics and kinetics but science alone is insufficient,academic
achieving global sustainability requires coordinated economic political and social decisions that recognize earth s limited resources and oxidative nature,academic
together these efforts will position humanity to meet the challenges of climate change and secure a sustainable future,academic
heatwaves are an increasingly common environmental event linked with climate change,academic
abnormally high heatwave temperatures can affect several mosquito vector traits that are determinants of pathogen transmission,academic
understanding how these mosquitoes adapt to high heat is vital for global public health,academic
rna methylation a key cellular mechanism in stress response and adaptation remains understudied in mosquito vector competence and heat stress responses,academic
this study investigates the role of rna methylation in mosquito responses to heatwaves and its influence on denv2 vector competence,academic
heatwave exposed and denv infected mosquitoes presented lower survivorship and lower antiviral transcriptional response developed high infection rates and increased the life expectancy of infected mosquitoes during the period of highest virus transmissibility,academic
in contrast inhibition of rna methylation in heatwave treated mosquitoes increased survivorship and the antiviral transcriptional response reducing infection prevalence from 78 to 37,academic
these results indicate that the rna methylation background in mosquitoes favors vector competence for denv2 during a heatwave exposure and points towards possible interventions to countermeasure the effect of climate change on denv transmission,academic
sedimentation processes continuously occurring in reservoirs can jeopardize their functionality and compromise dam safety,academic
climate change and associated hydrologic uncertainty are introducing additional stressors to us reservoirs several of them approaching the end of their design life,academic
the us army corps of engineers usace developed the enhancing reservoir sedimentation information for climate preparedness and resilience rsi system to improve reservoir storage information evaluate reservoir aggradation and life expectancy trends and improve climate preparedness and resilience,academic
the objective of this study was to detect anomalous records and identify multivariate relationships between rsi data for 184 reservoirs and associated watershed variables related to erosion and sedimentation processes such as topography land use and precipitation descriptors,academic
the analyses included preliminary data filtering autonomous anomaly detection aad kolmogorov smirnov and efran kse anomaly detection and principal component analysis pca,academic
pca results indicated that sedimentation rates and capacity losses had strong relationships with drainage basin size and runoff processes curve number while being independent of elevation related properties,academic
a total of 20 reservoirs had anomalous records detected,academic
variables with large z scores for anomalous records likely contributing to their detection were related to elevation characteristics watershed and channel slopes and minimum elevation precipitation trends maximum and cumulative monthly precipitation dam properties time since dam completion and initial trap efficiency and curve number,academic
study results will enable the refinement of the rsi dataset to provide reliable information regarding usace reservoir conditions and support the development of indicators related to climate change s impact on sedimentation,academic

ectoparasitic mites were more common on juveniles than adults,academic
after several hours of observing the species few copula events have been recorded all of them involving juvenile adult females which points to a monandrous reproduction syndrome for the species,academic
another phenomenon observed in the species was a change in coloration due to body temperature in individuals in which bright coloration becomes grayish in cold weather,academic
this study provides fundamental data for future monitoring and conservation efforts highlighting the species vulnerability to environmental changes and the need for specific conservation strategies,academic
low income neighbourhoods in our cities are often poorly planned spaces that exacerbate socioeconomic disparities their residents face,academic
these inequities also impact their health especially communities in the global south who are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change,academic
one such example of an inadequately planned rehabilitation neighbourhood is natwar parekh in mumbai s govandi,academic
over 25 000 former slum dwellers the population of a tier 3 city have been crammed into 61 seven storey buildings with 80 homes having little to no access to sunlight or ventilation,academic
the area is flanked by asia s largest landfill and polluting industries creating an unhealthy environment with poor air quality and contamination,academic
tuberculosis and other diseases are on the rise here and the average life expectancy is just 39 years almost half the national average,academic
govandi is ghettoised and neglected by the rest of mumbai,academic
children who grew up here hesitate to mention their address because of the stigma attached to living here,academic
burdened by this shame and loss govandi s youth came together seven years ago to work with a group of artists and urban practitioners from community design agency cda a social design organisation to reimagine their neighbourhood,academic
together they have redesigned garbage filled alleyways into accessible streets painted vibrant murals and held the first ever govandi arts festival that allowed them to redefine their narratives of the place they call home,academic
these initiatives have brought the community closer made them more resilient and even prompted spatial improvements by city authorities who were forced to turn their gaze here,academic
this essay explores the interlinkages between spatial improvements via arts and placemaking initiatives and their effects on the physical and emotional well being of govandi s youth,academic
urban practitioners natasha sharma and sandra alexander from cda explore methodologies for regenerative place making in this vulnerable neighbourhood,academic
algae have great therapeutic value and have attracted a great deal of attention due to the abundance of bioactive compounds they contain which may be the key to fighting diseases of various origins such as skin cancer breast cancer or osteosarcoma,academic
in this regard global trends indicate that cancer is likely to become the leading cause of death and the main obstacle to increased life expectancy in the 21st century which is related to multiple factors including the various effects of climate change which will continue to cause afflictions to human health,academic
then excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation uvr causes damage to dna proteins enzymes and various cellular structures and leads to the development of cancer premature aging of the skin wrinkles dryness dilation of blood vessels and loss of collagen and elastin or alterations of the immune system,academic
in addition multidrug resistance mdr is characterized by the overexpression of efflux pumps such as p glycoprotein or p gp that expel chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cancer cell being the main obstacle to their efficacy,academic
some molecules inhibit efflux pumps when co administered with antineoplastic agents such as glycolipids,academic
mycosporin like amino acids and glycolipids isolated from sargassum have shown an important role as potential anticancer agents,academic
the results show that glycolipids and mycosporin like amino acids present in brown algae of the genus sargassum exhibit cytotoxic effects on different types of cancer such as breast cancer leukemia and osteosarcoma which is a key criterion to be considered as a natural anti cancer strategy but more in depth in vitro studies are needed to represent them at the in vivo level as well as their validation in preclinical assays,academic
with coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 receding many countries are pondering what a post pandemic economy should look like,academic
some advocate a more inclusive stakeholder model of capitalism,academic
others caution that this would be insufficient to deal with our pre pandemic crises of income inequality and climate change,academic
many countries emphasize a green recovery with improved funding for health and social protection,academic
progressive tax reform and fiscal policy innovations are needed but there is concern that the world is already tilting towards a new round of austerity,academic
fundamentally the capitalist growth economy rests on levels of material consumption that are unsustainable and inequitable,academic
more radical proposals thus urge degrowth policies to reduce consumption levels while redistributing wealth and income to allow the poorer half of humanity to achieve an ethical life expectancy,academic
we have the policy tools to do so,academic
we need an activist public health movement to ensure there is sufficient political will to adopt them,academic
delayed maturity low fecundity and high adult survival are traits typical for species with a long life expectancy,academic
for such species even a small change in adult survival can strongly affect the population dynamics and viability,academic
we examined the effects of both regional and local climatic variability on adult survival of the little auk a long lived and numerous arctic seabird species,academic
we conducted a mark resighting study for a period of 8 years 2006 2013 simultaneously at three little auk breeding sites that are influenced by the west spitsbergen current which is the main carrier of warm atlantic water into the arctic,academic
we found that the survival of adult little auks was negatively correlated with both the north atlantic oscillation nao index and local summer sea surface temperature sst with a time lag of 2 and 1 year respectively,academic
the effects of nao and sst were likely mediated through a change in food quality and or availability 1 reproduction growth and development of arctic calanus copepods the main prey of little auks are negatively influenced by a reduction in sea ice reduced ice algal production and an earlier but shorter lasting spring bloom all of which result from an increased nao 2 a high sea surface temperature shortens the reproductive period of arctic calanus decreasing the number of eggs produced,academic
a synchronous variation in survival rates at the different colonies indicates that climatic forcing was similar throughout the study area,academic
our findings suggest that a predicted warmer climate in the arctic will negatively affect the population dynamics of the little auk a high arctic avian predator,academic
abstract the world needs to move quickly towards sustainability that should characterize all production and consumption patterns,academic
the global economic growth which was built on natural resources and biodiversity over centuries has resulted in two main issues environmental degradation and climate change,academic
this created a big challenge in the recent decades related to balancing economic growth with environmental quality preservation which has been a hot topic capturing the interest of researchers from different disciplines,academic
one of the possible ways to reduce environmental degradation while enhancing economic growth is investing in human capital,academic
this study investigates the determinants of ecological footprint as a proxy for environmental quality in algeria from 1980 to 2017 using several economic indicators,academic
another objective of the present study is to assess how education and life expectancy as social indicators can influence the environmental quality,academic
the autoregressive distributed lags ardl approach is used to estimate the constructed environmental degradation models,academic
as expected the obtained findings show that import is a significant factor that reduces ecological footprint in the long and the short run contrary to economic growth energy use export and natural resources rent,academic
moreover the findings show that education and life expectancy increase environmental degradation in the short run,academic
however while life expectancy keeps increasing environmental degradation in the long run education reduces it,academic
in light of these findings the current study provides several recommendations for better management of the country s natural and human resources which could help policymakers in directing the country towards sustainable development,academic
abstract the progress of science and technology has considerably increased the quality of life especially the material standard of living e,academic
disappearance of famines increase in life expectancy on the other hand climate change reduction of biodiversity decrease of natural resources and increase of environmental risks are some of the consequences of this human activities,academic
addressing these new challenges will require holistic comprehension and actionable approaches,academic
the mitigation of these consequences requires effective responses in terms of transition,academic
in this context engineering and design students need time but also adapted curricula focused on sustainability and eco design concepts to support evolution of their skills their knowledge and their culture,academic
this article discusses the integration of a strong sustainability knowledge within the ideation process through a pedagogical experience in order to develop new knowledge based approaches methodologies and tools,academic
the current state of air pollution is very difficult to ignore and it reduces life expectancy due to increased morbidity and mortality rate and not only that it also affects climate change,academic
therefore air pollution monitoring and control need to be considered as one of the biggest tasks for our future planet,academic
durgapur city an industrial hub in west bengal is considered in the present work to review air pollution during festivals,academic
in our experimental study significant changes are found in two events diwali days typically october november and regular days january considered here,academic
we collected data from our pollution monitoring device on daily observations and 90 of the data collected was valid among all other pollutants like co no2 so2 we consider particulate matters pm2,academic
5 and pm10 and lay much greater stress on pm2,academic
5 which is more dangerous among the two,academic
the pollution level during the festival is found to be 806,academic
95 μg m3 while on other regular days it was 432,academic
we observe that from fireworks during diwali pm10 is more emitted than pm2,academic
5 while pm2,academic
5 is more due to industrial and vehicular emissions,academic
while global warming and climate change associated with increasing carbon dioxide are widely seen to be one of the most serious worldwide dangers to population health little is known regarding how country alters the linkage between increasing co2 emissions and population health outcomes,academic
current literature on the health effects of co2 emissions recommends various factors that may establish a more robust link including health expenditure and research and development,academic
therefore the purpose of this inquiry is to examine the effectiveness of health expenditure and r d in improving health outcomes through reducing co2 emissions,academic
using data for saudi arabia over the period 2000 2018 the dynamic ordinary least squares dols technique shows that i health and r d expenditures decrease infant mortality and increase life expectancy ii health and r d expenditures reduce co2 emissions in all the estimated models iii health and r d expenditures can improve health outcomes through reducing co2 emissions and iv health and r d expenditures have both direct and indirect effect on health outcomes,academic
policy implications and limitations are also discussed,academic
global population growth increased life expectancy and climate change are all impacting world s food systems,academic
in industrialised countries many individuals are consuming significantly more protein than needed to maintain health with the majority being obtained from animal products including meat dairy fish and other aquatic animals,academic
current animal production systems are responsible for a large proportion of land and fresh water use and directly contributing to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases,academic
overall approximately 60 of the global protein produced is used for animal and fish feed,academic
concerns about their impact on both human and planetary health have led to calls to dramatically curb our consumption of animal products,academic
underutilised plants insects and single cell organisms are all actively being considered as alternative protein sources,academic
each present challenges that need to be met before they can become economically viable and safe alternatives for food or feed,academic
many plant species contain anti nutritional factors that impair the digestion and absorption of protein and micronutrients,academic
insects represent a potentially rich source of high quality protein although questions remain relating to digestibility allergenicity and biosecurity,academic
algae fungi and bacteria are also a rich source of protein and there is growing interest in the development of cultured meat using stem cell technology,academic
for the foreseeable future it appears likely that the protein economy will remain mixed,academic
the present paper reviews progress and future opportunities in the development of novel protein sources as food and animal feed,academic
as global changes in the environment continue to shape communities the link between changes in the environment and public health has become clearer,academic
the many ways that changes in the environment can affect public health quality measures are looked at in this study,academic
air quality water supply urbanisation and climate change are given special attention,academic
as cities grow and more factories are built the environment changes in ways that make health problems like lung diseases water borne diseases and vector borne diseases worse,academic
extreme weather events like storms floods and heat waves have also grown to be major determinant of public health,academic
this study examines a lot of studies already conducted to ascertain how environmental changes could result in lower health measurements like life expectancy mortality rates and chronic illness prevalence,academic
furthermore emphasised in the study is the need of knowing how interdependent socioeconomic determinants of health are with external elements as these elements may make vulnerable populations even more vulnerable,academic
the study reveals how environmentally friendly behaviour modern technology and government regulations could assist to mitigate the negative health consequences of environmental changes,academic
it also looks at how environmental health tracking systems and predictive analytics can help shape public health policies and make sure that the right steps are taken at the right time,academic
the study shows how careful environmental management and health policy can make public health systems more resilient by looking at global case studies and past data,academic
the results show that to successfully deal with the problems caused by changes in the environment we need to use interdisciplinary methods that take into account things like hospital infrastructure environmental sustainability and community resilience,academic
to sum up this study makes a strong case for making environmental health a central part of public health policy in order to improve people s quality of life lower the number of diseases and achieve long lasting public health results in the face of ongoing environmental problems,academic
carbon dioxide emission are major driver of global warming and climate change hence one should urgently reduce carbon dioxide emission to avoid the impacts from climate change,academic
with such a worldwide problem the regulation and generalization have become a problem,academic
when comparing each countries carbon dioxide emission data mankind has missed lots of omitted variables including countries economics status countries location etc,academic
as the world enters the era of big data analysis this study will mainly discuss why some developing countries cannot reduce carbon dioxide emission at the same rate as those developed countries,academic
from the dataset the research used 12 major carbon dioxide countries all over the world including both developing and developed countries,academic
the research first performed explanatory data analysis to check if there is any association between carbon dioxide emission gdp per capital and life expectancy in all 12 countries,academic
then the pca classification is adopted to classify all the selected 12 countries and one may see all the developing countries are classified in similar area,academic
in the end the study performed a sarima time series analysis on china s future carbon dioxide emission and the result showed a decline trend of china s carbon dioxide emission in the future,academic
this research will correct the misleading idea on simply compare with countries precisely carbon dioxide emission and help to understand the tradeoffs that many developing countries face during reduction of carbon dioxide,academic
malaria transmission is strongly influenced by traits such as mosquito life expectancy vector competence and the extrinsic incubation period eip which is the development time of the parasite inside the mosquito,academic
even though these traits are known to be shaped by environmental temperature and there is considerable concern that climate change could increase disease risk in certain areas surprisingly these temperature dependencies are poorly characterized,academic
here we use a mechanistic model fitted to novel experimental data to describe how plasmodium falciparum infection of the african malaria vector anopheles gambiae is modulated by temperature including its influences on parasite establishment conversion efficiency through parasite developmental stages eip and overall competence,academic
we use these data together with novel estimates of the survival of infected blood fed mosquitoes to explore the potential influence of temperature on transmission in four locations in kenya considering recent conditions and future climate change,academic
results provide insights into factors limiting transmission in cooler environments and indicate that increases in malaria transmission efficiency due to climate warming in areas like the kenyan highlands might be less than previously predicted,academic
despite the high propensity of energy usage in driving the economic activities the issues of global climate change and global warming which pose enormous threats to human welfare have motivated the growing need for energy sustainability globally,academic
in the light of the above the sustainable development goal sdg 7 advocates for the usage of energy from cleaner sources,academic
meanwhile impact of energy usage on human welfare has largely been the issue of concern among the scholars in nigeria,academic
against this backdrop this study examined energy sustainability and human welfare in nigeria,academic
consequently data was collected from secondary sources and analyzed within the framework of fully modified ordinary least squares fmols and granger causality test,academic
the summary of the principal findings in this is enunciated as follows energy sustainability and life expectancy had a positive and significant relationship in nigeria,academic
government expenditures on health had both negative and insignificant relationship with life expectancy in nigeria,academic
also there was a unidirectional causality flowing from life expectancy to electricity consumption from hydroelectric sources in nigeria,academic
furthermore one way feedback flows from government expenditure on health to life expectancy,academic
from these findings this study recommends that nigeria would want to achieve the sustainable development goals one 1 promoting good life for the people and seven 7 affordable and clean energy simultaneously before the sdgs timeline elapses in 2030 the nigerian policymakers and all stakeholders should be aggressively involved in energy sustainability movement in the country,academic
in light of agenda 2030 sustainability awareness is steadily growing worldwide,academic
all institutions including banks and financial institutions are working to reduce their carbon footprints,academic
several indirect problems have arisen for india as a result of the banking process such as global warming climate change irregular monsoon air pollution heavy rain poor air quality health problems ozone depletion fossil fuel use recurrent destruction of forests for daily use improper e waste disposal,academic
these issues can be overcome with sustainable banking practices green banking which benefit the customer s satisfaction and quality of life,academic
however sustainability can be achieved only when the customers accept green banking and are satisfied with it,academic
in order to do that the bank must understand the level of expectations and perception of its customers toward green initiatives and to what extent the initiatives satisfy their day to day needs,academic
this paper provides an overview of expectancy disconfirmation integrations into customer satisfaction of india s largest public sector banks,academic
as part of the present theoretical analysis we first examine the level of awareness expectations and perception differences of customers to determine their satisfaction level,academic
we then provide some evidence from sbi in kerala regarding dissatisfying factors in green banking practices,academic
the united states despite its affluence faces a number of daunting policy challenges,academic
we rank last among 16 wealthy peers in life expectancy infant mortality and obesity and have taken very little action on climate change despite the extremity of the threat it poses not only to future generations but even those alive today,academic
abstract security is often used in most meaningful concepts of contemporary political vocabulary,academic
furthermore it concerns interesting aspects of the survival of nations and states in the world,academic
in the first decade of the 21st century mankind got into a qualitatively new phase of its development in which it should invariably use the uncertainty area,academic
there are no doubts about the facts that environmental pollution can cause a variety of ecologically based diseases and this in turn leads to reduction in the average life expectancy,academic
this paper analyzes the relations between climate changes today and their impact on the security area,academic
problems that have arisen worldwide and in the republic of bulgaria because of the climate change are pointed out,academic
the paper discuses directions for improving the security environment in the context of climate changes,academic
pakistan is facing an energy crisis and is also severely affected by climate change,academic
moreover pakistan is not doing well as far as health outcome indicators are concerned,academic
the causal nexus among energy environment and health outcomes is well established in literature,academic
besides financial development also grabs the attention of health outcome literature as financial development can play a significant role in improving health outcomes,academic
thus this study was conducted to test the causal nexus among energy consumption environmental degradation financial development and health outcomes in the case of pakistan,academic
this study proxies health outcomes with life expectancy and infant mortality,academic
time series data have been analyzed through different econometric techniques such as unit root tests cointegration techniques causality techniques and cointegration regressions,academic
moreover this study not just discovers the causal direction among variables but also determines the strength of causality through variance decomposition,academic
results of the study confirm that all variables of the study are cointegrated in the long run,academic
the causality analysis reveals that unidirectional causality is running from energy consumption and environmental degradation to health outcomes whereas bidirectional causality is found between financial development and health outcomes in the long run,academic
besides this study also determines the effect of energy environmental degradation and financial development in the health outcome model and finds that energy and financial development can help pakistan to improve health outcomes,academic
policy implications are recommended for pakistan,academic

with the rapid development of information and communication technologies the concept of a smart city has become a reality and these smart cities are constantly increasing in most countries of the world because of the desire of governments to enhance the lives of their citizens and increase both efficiency and sustainability,academic
the main idea of the concept of smart cities is to integrate the system of services in the cities such as health energy education transportation and public services and provide them to citizens everywhere,academic
as health monitoring is one of the most important applications of a smart city this paper presents the issues of modeling a system for monitoring the health of various population groups of a smart city,academic
the relevance of such systems is caused by the emergence of fundamentally new types of cities an increase in the number and average life expectancy of the population and the emergence of new diseases caused by climate change,academic
the peculiarity of the system lies in its complex nature i,academic
it solves the problem of assessing the status of people requiring medical care calling medical personnel and monitoring the effectiveness of clinics by the government,academic
racial and ethnic minority communities including american indian and alaska natives have been disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution and contamination,academic
this includes siting and location of point sources of pollution legacies of contamination of drinking and recreational water and mining military and agricultural impacts,academic
as a result both quantity and quality of culturally important subsistence resources are diminished contributing to poor nutrition and obesity and overall reductions in quality of life and life expectancy,academic
climate change is adding to these impacts on native american communities variably causing drought increased flooding and forced relocation affecting tribal water resources traditional foods forests and forest resources and tribal health,academic
this article will highlight several extramural research projects supported by the united states environmental protection agency usepa science to achieve results star tribal environmental research grants as a mechanism to address the environmental health inequities and disparities faced by tribal communities,academic
the tribal research portfolio has focused on addressing tribal environmental health risks through community based participatory research,academic
specifically the star research program was developed under the premise that tribal populations may be at an increased risk for environmentally induced diseases as a result of unique subsistence and traditional practices of the tribes and alaska native villages community activities occupations and customs and or environmental releases that significantly and disproportionately impact tribal lands,academic
through a series of case studies this article will demonstrate how grantees tribal community leaders and members and academic collaborators have been addressing these complex environmental concerns by developing capacity expertise and tools through community engaged research,academic
arctic territories are one of the priorities in the comprehensive geopolitical and geoeconomic development of the russian federation,academic
in this regard such issues as a new arctic healthcare model stabilization of the demographic processes health protection and increasing life expectancy of the indigenous and newcomer population are growing in importance,academic
the arctic is an area of special strategic interest to russia not only because of the prospects for natural resource development but also due to the rapid global climate change,academic
the implementation of large scale competitive projects requires an influx of labour force leading to a predictable increase in the population of the arctic settlements,academic
indigenous peoples living on the arctic territories of the russian federation comprise a special population group which needs state support due to the vulnerability of its traditional way of life and its original habitat,academic
the state policy of sustainable development is being implemented with regard to them,academic
this article presents a review of the literature analysing the impact of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of unfavourable climatic and geophysical factors on the human cardiovascular system in the arctic,academic
it has been shown that a significant proportion of the risks of cardiovascular events in the arctic is linked to environmental pollution as a result of active human economic activity and to adverse climatic conditions,academic
improving the technologies of arctic healthcare from the standpoint of 4p medicine aimed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and understanding the mechanisms of the adverse effects of natural climatic and anthropogenic factors will significantly enhance the quality of medical care and preserve the health of the indigenous and newcomer population of the russian arctic,academic
abstract objective the objective of this study is to map vulnerability of asian countries to the covid 19 pandemic,academic
method according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 2007 framework for natural hazards vulnerability is a function of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity,academic
from an extensive literature review we identified 16 socioeconomic meteorological environmental and health factors that influence coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 cases and deaths,academic
the underlying factors of vulnerability were identified using principal component analysis,academic
results our findings indicate that the percentage of the urban population obesity rate air connectivity and the population aged 65 and over diabetes prevalence and pm2,academic
5 levels all contributed significantly to covid 19 sensitivity,academic
subsequently governance effectiveness human development index hdi vaccination rate and life expectancy at birth and gross domestic product gdp all had a positive effect on adaptive capacity,academic
the estimated vulnerability was corroborated by a pearson correlation of 0,academic
615 between death per million population and vulnerability,academic
conclusion this study demonstrates the application of universal indicators for assessing pandemic vulnerability for informed policy interventions such as the covax vaccine roll out priority,academic
despite data limitations and a lack of spatiotemporal analysis this study s methodological framework allows for ample data incorporation and replication,academic
the objective of this paper was to gain novel insights into the complex relationships among sustainable development goals sdgs in shaping productivity gdp capita growth,academic
using dynamic panel regressions on data collected in 138 countries between 2000 and 2017 we found that rising temperatures negatively affect growth and mitigate the impact of other sdgs on growth,academic
we also found that co2 emissions have a u shaped relationship with growth life expectancy negatively influences growth positively moderated by rising temperatures and food security positively impacts growth negatively moderated by rising temperatures,academic
this study highlights the difficulty of simultaneously implementing sdgs and elucidates novel research perspectives and policies to decrease the negative impacts of climate change on socio economic and environmental well being,academic
public health is responsible for extraordinary achievements over the past century such as remarkable gains in life expectancy and substantial decreases in infectious disease mortality and could make similar critical contributions to health in this century,academic
public health should be ascendant but ample evidence suggests that it is on the defensive today underappreciated and underfunded,academic
government actions to improve the health of populations are widely suspect as illustrated by the controversies involving efforts to curb soda container sizes in new york city state and federal efforts to limit reproductive health rights and global efforts to address climate change,academic
by contrast traditional medicine continues to be privileged,academic
the burgeoning precision medicine agenda and the continuing emphasis on the treatment for cancer have captured the imagination of funding agencies,academic
europe once had widespread malaria but today it is free from endemic transmission,academic
changing land use agricultural practices housing quality urbanization climate change and improved healthcare are among the many factors thought to have played a role in the declines of malaria seen but their effects and relative contributions have rarely been quantified,academic
spatial datasets on changes in climate wealth life expectancy urbanization and land use trends over the past century were combined with datasets depicting the reduction in malaria transmission across 31 european countries and the relationships were explored,academic
moreover the conditions in current malaria eliminating countries were compared with those in europe at the time of declining transmission and elimination to assess similarities,academic
indicators relating to socio economic improvements such as wealth life expectancy and urbanization were strongly correlated with the decline of malaria in europe whereas those describing climatic and land use changes showed weaker relationships,academic
present day malaria elimination countries have now arrived at similar socio economic indicator levels as european countries at the time malaria elimination was achieved offering hope for achievement of sustainable elimination,academic
abstract warming temperatures are greatly impacting wild organisms across the globe,academic
some of the negative impacts of climate change can be mitigated behaviorally for example by changes in habitat and oviposition site choice,academic
temperatures are reportedly warming faster at night than during the day yet studies assessing the impacts of increasing night temperature are rare,academic
we used the finnish glanville fritillary butterfly melitaea cinxia as study species and exposed adult butterflies of both sexes to warmer night conditions,academic
under a seminatural outdoor enclosure we assessed whether females base their oviposition choices primarily on habitat site characteristics open suggestive of dry meadows versus covered by a coarse canopy suggestive of pastures or on plant condition dry vs,academic
lush and if their choice is altered by the thermal conditions experienced at night,academic
as exposure to warmer environmental conditions is expected to increase resting metabolic rate and potentially reduce life expectancy we further assessed the fitness implications of warm night temperatures,academic
we found that females prefer open sites for oviposition and that females do not switch their oviposition strategy based on the thermal conditions they experienced at night prior to the reproductive event,academic
exposure to warm nights did not influence female lifespan but the egg hatching success of their offspring was reduced,academic
in addition we found that males exposed to warm nights sired larger clutches with higher hatching rate,academic
as warm night exposure reduced male lifespan this may imply a switch in male resource allocation strategy toward increased offspring quality,academic
the present work adds on to the complex implications of climate warming and highlights the importance of the often neglected role of males in shaping offspring performance,academic
quality of life has advanced since the industrial revolution and this advancement has accelerated with the information revolution,academic
life expectancy has increased catalytic converters protect our air a disabled athlete runs with the fastest runners in the world 1 and global real gdp per capita has grown by a factor of 2,academic

this quality of life advancement is the result of continuous innovation,academic
in today s global economy innovation is essential for canada to compete even to participate and to continue advancing our quality of life,academic
collective global innovation has never been more critical,academic
world population growth 7 billion and counting diminishing non renewable resources oil and beyond and escalating environmental challenges climate change and pollution all require global scale innovations or our collective quality of life will not be sustained,academic
canadians have contributed much to the world including the telephone and smartphone candu reactors snowmobiles imax and the pacemaker,academic
however over the last number of years there have been multiple reports critical of canada s capacity for technological innovation 3 and studies that offer strategies for improvement,academic
4 while it is true that innovation is essential to the future of both canada and the world innovation is only a means to an end and it is incumbent on us to define the desired ends,academic
innovation can be a means to a higher quality of life and a more sustainable future for generations to come or it can simply be a means to increase the financial prosperity of the nation,academic
to achieve the ends we value it is essential to measure innovation in terms of these ends not in terms of subtle differences in the rate of change in the gdp per capita,academic
are our innovations leading to cleaner water for all a healthier and complete diet for all and meaningful employment for all,academic
abstract since climate change presents an unprecedented threat to public health creating environmentally sustainable communi ties has become an important policy goal,academic
many local governments have voluntarily implemented sustainability practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change at community levels,academic
because of the potential benefits scholars and practitioners are paying increasing attention to the sustainability practices of local government,academic
this study provides evidence for their health benefits after analyzing data of more than 3000 older adults between 2012 and 2016,academic
our findings suggest that home weatherization assistance programs are associated with an increased likelihood that older adults will view life expectancy optimistically,academic
moreover installing charging stations for electric vehicles is associated with increased physical activities,academic
our findings have important implications for local governments by linking climate change and community health issues,academic

backgroundenergy consumption is necessary for human well being yet the growth of energy consumption also contributes to climate change and a range of negative externalities,academic
thus a key sustainability challenge is to efficiently use energy consumption to promote human well being,academic
this manuscript contributes to the growing literature on the ecological intensity of well being eiwb by modeling the relationship between democratic institutions and the energy intensity of well being,academic
methodswe use international data to understand how democratic institutions understood as a combination of elected legislature elected executives and democratic competition impact the energy intensity of well being,academic
the energy intensity of well being is an adjusted ratio of energy consumption and life expectancy,academic
we combine random intercept mixed effect models with entropy balancing constraints to create covariate balance between democracies and non democracies,academic
resultscontrary to our expectations we find that consistently null results suggesting that democracies do not leverage their energy consumption to improve well being more effectively than other systems of government,academic
democracy and its subcomponents do not appear to improve or reduce the energy intensity of well being,academic
conclusionsdemocracy does not appear to improve sustainability operationalized as the energy intensity of well being,academic
on the other hand democracies do not appear to do worse than non democracies suggesting democratization can spread without reducing sustainability,academic
the ageing of the population is rapidly escalating worldwide irrespective of unpredictable health challenges like climate change emerging infectious disease a microbe that develops drug resistance,academic
india is also experiencing rapid socioeconomic progress and urbanization and the result of this demographic transition is population ageing,academic
even though there is an increase in life expectancy there is no increase in health span and thus increased life expectancy leads to expansion of morbidity,academic
longer life expectancy with the expansion of morbidity could enforce a challenge to geroscience as well as a substantial health burden and a threat to the national economy,academic
in normal ageing chronological age equates to biological age but certain disease conditions accelerate biological age,academic

methods correlation and regression analyses were used to examine associations between change in target object severity and patients pre treatment diagnosis symptom distress and treatment outcome expectancy and between change in target objective severity and patients ratings of group therapy process group climate therapeutic alliance group cohesion,academic
the relationship between change in target objective severity and longer range life satisfaction was also examined in a subsample of patients who rated life satisfaction at follow up,academic
results while change in target objective severity was not significantly related to pre treatment variables significant associations were found with several aspects of group therapy process,academic
patients experience of a highly engaged group climate was uniquely associated with improvement in target object severity,academic
such improvement was significantly related to longer term life satisfaction after controlling for general symptom change,academic
conclusion the working atmosphere in group therapy contributes to patients progress regarding individual treatment targets and such progress is an important factor in later satisfaction,academic
attention to individualized treatment targets deserves further clinical and research attention in the context of integrative group therapy for personality dysfunction,academic
practitioner points this study found that patients attending an integrative group treatment programme for personality dysfunction experienced significant improvement in severity of distress related to individual treatment objectives,academic
improvement in severity of distress related to individual treatment objectives was uniquely associated with patients experience of an engaged collaborative working atmosphere,academic
improvement in individual target objective severity was associated with patients ratings of overall life satisfaction rated an average of 9 months following termination after controlling for change in general symptom severity,academic

dhaka is also considered one of the most environmentally contaminated cities in the world yet for some of the increasing population of rural poor it is a highly attractive place to live,academic
for those living in rural areas available land is decreasing because of overpopulation and climate change and for some the ground water is contaminated with arsenic,academic
given the struggles in their lives people come to dhaka by the thousands each week,academic
with limited education skills and financial resources most of these migrants end up living in a slum,academic

the objective of the study is to examine the patterns of the employment of older people in latvia estonia and lithuania over the recent decade and the changes brought about by the first wave coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020,academic
the study is based on the eurostat statistical data as well as the microdata from the recent wave of the survey of health ageing and retirement share,academic
particular attention is paid to the data collected in share wave 8 covid 19 survey conducted in june august 2020 in 26 european countries and israel via computer assisted telephone interviews,academic
questions examined how people aged 50 years and older coped with socioeconomic and health related impact of covid 19,academic
during the last decade participation of older age groups in labour market is gradually growing with the increase of the statutory retirement age and life expectancy,academic
employment rates in the pre retirement and post retirement age groups are comparatively high in latvia and other baltic states as contrasted to the eu averages especially among women,academic
despite of relatively worse health status people in the baltic countries also demonstrate the highest share of respondents with willingness to work even upon reaching pension age,academic
in 2020 the covid 19 had relatively mild impact on it,academic
the branches with traditionally high share of workers aged 50 education healthcare agriculture administrative services were least affected by lockdown measures,academic

abstract improvements in environmental health have had the most significant impact on health status,academic
in australia life expectancy has significantly increased through provision of vaccination safe food and drinking water appropriate sewage disposal and other environmental health measures,academic
yet the profession that is instrumental in delivering environmental health services at the local community level is overlooked,academic
rarely featuring in mainstream media the successes of environmental health officers ehos are invisible to the general public,academic
as a consequence students entering university are unaware of the profession and its significant role in society,academic
this has resulted in there being too few ehos to meet the current regulatory requirements much less deal with the emerging environmental health issues arising as a consequence of changing global conditions including climate change,academic
to futureproof australian society and public health this workforce issue and the associated oversight of environmental health must be addressed now,academic
implementation of strict policies for mitigating climate change has a direct impact on public health as far as the external health costs of electricity generation can be reduced thanks to the reduction of emission of typical pollutants by switching to cleaner low carbon fuels and achieving energy efficiency improvements,academic
renewables have lower external health costs due to the lower life cycle emission of typical air pollutants linked to electricity generation such as so2 nox particulate matter nh3 or nmvoc non methane volatile organic compounds which all appear to have serious negative effects on human health,academic
our case study performed in the baltic states analyzed the dynamics of external health costs in parallel with the dynamics of the main health indicators in these countries life expectancy at birth mortality rates healthy life years self perceived health and illness indicators,academic
we employed the data for external health costs retrieved from the cases database as well as the health statistics data compiled from the eurostat database,academic
the time range of the study was 2010 2018 due to the availability of consistent health indicators for the eu member states,academic
our results show that the decrease of external health costs had a positive impact on the increase of the self perceived good health and reduction of long standing illness as well as the decrease of infant death rate,academic
our conclusions might be useful for other countries as well as for understanding the additional benefits of climate change mitigation policies and tracking their positive health impacts,academic
the cooperation initiatives on clean energy and climate change mitigation between countries like one belt one road initiative by the chinese government can also yield additional benefits linked to the public health improvements,academic
in 2009 big challenges facing the agricultural sector in the twenty first century were presented to the world,academic
human population growth increased life expectancy loss of biodiversity climate change and accelerated land degradation are the main factors con tributing to rethink agriculture system production,academic
in that scenery modern biotechnology has set a stage for the advancement of agricultural practices and it is clearly an important ally to apply a broad array of technologies and innovative systems where they are most needed such as enhancing crop productivity increasing yields and ultimately ensuring food security,academic
one of the biggest challenges is related to technify production systems but with no doubt developing genetic improvement toward getting an efficient and sus tainable agriculture generating new seed qualities new traits such as among others to upset fatty acids content in oilseed crops have been growing up significantly due to industry interest,academic
in this study a review about the main advances in genetic improvement of some oilseed crops starting with omics to understand metabolic routes and to find out key genes in seed oil production and also getting in use of modern biotechnology to alter the production of fatty acids and to face biotic challenges in oilseed crops is presented,academic

fortunately the violent insurrection at the us capitol on january 6 2021 failed and the inauguration of president biden occurred two weeks later without incident,academic
since taking office the biden administration has initiated a host of federal policy changes affecting not only health but other areas of policy that relate to health most notably environmental protection and climate change,academic
some of these policy shifts reverse trump era policies harmful to health while others aim to improve or strengthen existing programs,academic
not surprisingly many have aligned closely with ideas and recommendations contained in the 13 pieces posted thus far in the building back better series,academic
because the administration continues to face formidable challenges that require timely practical evidence based policy advice we will continue the series for the foreseeable future and invite readers to visit our website https www,academic

bervie braes is a 750 m long and up to 55 m high coastal slope above a residential area and harbour in stonehaven scotland with a history of instability mostly associated with the road traversing the slope,academic
this paper outlines the most probable causes of the instability on the slope and details the hazards that had to be taken into account during the design and construction of stabilisation measures,academic
the hazards associated with hydrology in terms of future potential change in rainfall patterns and intensity but also in terms of providing adequate drainage capacity and flows were juxtaposed against the geotechnical hazards of shallow landslips and erosion near the surface as well as deep seated landslides on the slope,academic
owing to the complex nature of the hazards and the need for longer life expectancy of the design the soil nailing option was combined with eco engineering strategies to provide resilience for a changing climate,academic

therefore changes in death rates may occur due to climate and economic changes,academic
in this study we extend a previous study into excess deaths as a result of climate change to also provide a comprehensive investigation of the impact of economic changes using annual female and male data for 5 developed oecd countries,academic
we find that there is strong negative relationship between mortality index and climate and economic proxies,academic
this model shows to provide better fitting and forecasting results both for females and males and for all countries studied,academic
the objective of the study was to examine whether cold climate is associated with poorer health in diverse arctic populations,academic
with climate change increasingly affecting the arctic the association between climate and population health status is of public health significance,academic
the mean january and july temperatures were determined for 27 arctic regions based on weather station data for the period 1961 1990 and their association with a variety of health outcomes assessed by correlation and multiple linear regression analyses,academic
mean january temperature was inversely associated with infant and perinatal mortality rate age standardized mortality rate from respiratory diseases and age specific fertility rate for teens and directly associated with life expectancy at birth in both males and females independent of a variety of socioeconomic demographic and health care factors,academic
mean july temperature was also associated with infant mortality and mortality from respiratory diseases and with total fertility rate,academic
for every 10 c increase in mean january temperature the life expectancy at birth among males increased by about 6 years and infant mortality rate decreased by about 4 deaths 1 000 livebirths,academic
cold climate is significantly associated with higher mortality and fertility in arctic populations and should be recognized in public health planning,academic

the average life expectancy of japanese has increased but various forms of disease including cancer and dementia debase the quality of life,academic
affluent urban life today is supported by the countryside which undertakes foodproduction and preserves the natural environment,academic

we live now at a crossroads in the 4 billion year long history of life on the earth,academic
the thread of genes has continued to the pressent,academic

advances in medical technology have contribute greatly to the protection of our life and genes,academic
indigenous forests have unsophisticatedly fostered our health physical and mental soul and have protected our genes,academic
we humans and other animals alike are consumers in the ecosystems on the earth,academic
greenplants are the only producers and bacteria and fungi are decomposers,academic
green plants especially multi layered native forests that enrich green plants are the very foundation of human existence,academic
japanese were particularly zealous in protecting and bequeathing native forests in each community and reforesting after destroying forests to construct paddy fields roads and villages just as other peoples did in other partsof the world,academic
native forests in most areas of japan are laurel forests,academic
main tree species of laurel forests have evergreen thick watery leaves and deep taproots grabbing thesoil,academic
so multi layered native forests have the function of environmental protection including noise insulation windbreaking air and water purification and water retention as well as the function of disaster mitigation minimizing damage from storms earthquakes fires and tsunamis,academic
forests absorb co2 in the air through photosynthesis and fix carbon as an organic compound in the tree body,academic
this helps curb global warming,academic
in the age of deteriorating biodiversity it is worthy of special mention that there are so many tree species and so many species of birds insects and small animals in an indigenous forest as well as bacteria and fungi living in the soil,academic
thus indigenous forests maintain rich biodiversity and are the real green environments that protect our life heart and genes,academic
however indigenous forests are rapidly vanishing from almost all the areas of the world,academic
where native forests still remain they should be preserved,academic
where native forests are destroyed they should be restored and regenerated by all possible mean,academic
we conduct phytosociological field surveys to determine main tree species of a given district nurse their potted seedlings until theroot system fully develops in the containers and plant them mixed and densely with local citizens,academic

natural ecosystems such as forests coral reefs mangroves and grasslands provide essential goods and services that support human health and food security,academic
examples of these ecosystem services include crop pollination by wild pollinators regulation of water flow by mangroves and provision of wild foods and natural medicines by forests,academic
globally ecosystem degradation due to deforestation overharvesting pollution poorly planned infrastructure projects climate change urbanization and other threats compromises ecosystem function and disrupts the flow of ecosystem services,academic
the rockefeller foundation lancet commission on planetary health noted that negative environmental trends pose serious threats to the global health gains of the past decades,academic
1 the commission highlights environmental degradation as a major issue that could reverse many of the development advances made in recent decades such as increased life expectancy decreased child mortality and lower rates of extreme poverty,academic
mechanisms through which global environmental change affects human health and food security include variations in the availability and quality of food water and natural medicines changes in the exposure to zoonotic vectorborne and other infectious pathogens as illustrated by the coronavirus disease 2019 covid 19 pandemic as well as alterations in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events,academic
incorporating natural ecosystems into global health and food security programmes can help meet the goals of the health and food security sectors while contributing to the improved management and sustainability of ecosystems and the important services they provide,academic
here we suggest three practical ways in which natural ecosystems can be incorporated into global health and food security programmes to achieve these goals more sustainably and ensure that ecosystem degradation does not undermine previous achievements in these sectors,academic
these suggestions will be most useful for international development donors programme managers and technical specialists who fund and implement global health and food security programmes,academic
we link each suggestion with a summary of the relevant evidence that supports it and specific types of actions to implement the suggestions,academic
first ecosystem related questions should be included in household surveys as appropriate,academic
many global health and food security programmes conduct household surveys throughout project implementation,academic
incorporating relevant survey questions can help advance understanding of the ecosystem goods and services that target households rely on of perceived changes to the availability of these goods and services and of how household reliance on local ecosystems varies based on socioeconomic status gender and other factors among other topics,academic
a growing body of research demonstrates the many different ways that households benefit from natural ecosystems,academic
for example an analysis conducted in 2016 involving 7975 households in 24 tropical countries found that over three quarters of study households harvested wild foods from local ecosystems for subsistence and sale,academic
2 wild foods are often rich in micronutrients supplement carbohydrate rich diets common in many low income countries and can be an important source of income for poorer households and those experiencing shocks,academic
2 3 a global analysis found that many foods like pumpkin mango and melon that are rich in micronutrients including vitamin a iron and folic acid require animal pollinators for production,academic
4 natural ecosystems also provide medicinal plants for use in traditional medicine an estimated 80 of people in low income countries rely on traditional medicine to treat various ailments such as infections inflammation and cardiovascular disease,academic
5 examples of ecosystem related survey questions that reflect the current state of the evidence could focus on household use of wild foods such as fish insects meat fruits and vegetables use of wild foods during times of shock or crisis and changes in the availability of wild foods due to local environmental change,academic
other potential topics to explore through survey questions include the status of local pollinator populations on household farms and the effects of local environmental change on crop productivity and the availability of medicinal plants,academic
these types of questions incorporated within the surveys and tailored to the local context provide valuable information that can help guide activities aimed at sustaining the natural resource base and its contributions to health and food security,academic
second efforts to improve ecosystem management should be supported,academic
the global health and food security sectors can support a range of activities that strengthen the natural resource base critical to optimizing the effectiveness and sustainability of their programmes,academic
scientific consensus that the earth s natural ecosystems have entered an unprecedented era of degradation raising concerns about their ability to continue providing ecosystem services is increasing,academic
a growing body of evidence demonstrates linkages between natural ecosystems and global health and food security priorities such as decreasing incorporating natural ecosystems into global health and food security programmes anila jacob kiersten johnson robert cohen sara e carlson,academic
background sustainable development goal 8 refers to decent work and economic growth,academic
in the context of climate change and global resource depletion it is important to understand whether low economic growth is compatible with positive population health in rich countries particularly because the past decade of austerity in the uk and usa is associated with stagnating life expectancy,academic
japan provides a natural experiment in that it has experienced low economic growth since 1992 and life expectancy continued to improve,academic
however the trend in health inequality in good self rated health is unknown,academic
methods we examined trends in health and health inequalities using ten triennial waves of a nationally representative survey in japan 1986 2013 n 731 647,academic
change in age standardized self rated good health was calculated and health inequalities and their time trends were calculated using slope and relative indices of inequality sii and rii respectively in relation to net household income,academic
analyses were stratified by sex and age for children 6 18 years working age adults 20 59 years younger old 60 69 years and older old 70 79 years given age differences in relation to the economy and labour market,academic
time trends of sii and rii were tested during the period of economic stagnation 1992 2013,academic
results overall age standardised self rated good health was high among children 70 and low among the older old 30,academic
in all age groups prevalence of good health declined slightly from its peak in 1995 but increased after 2007,academic
in 1992 among children working age adults and younger old health inequality based on sii for net household income was small approximately 10 lower prevalence of good health in those with lowest compared to highest income,academic
among working age adults time trends of health inequalities between 1992 and 2013 were curvilinear,academic
the sii narrowed and then widened after 2002 quadratic trends in men and women p conclusion the long term low growth japanese economy appears compatible with maintaining and improving population health and holding health inequalities at current levels,academic

if it increases 3 c the rise will be 84 cm,academic
besides it has been demonstrated that the carbon footprint associated with various human activities leads to a steady increase in global mean temperature,academic
most of the gases that human activity emits into the atmosphere are due to the industrial processes that require a lot of energy for the transformation of the raw materials,academic
furthermore a large part of the energy consumed in the industry is dissipated in the form of heat also called waste heat,academic
as a clear example in the eu27 it is estimated that more than 65 of the energy used in the energy intensive industries eii industry is lost in form of waste heat representing yearly the 21 the eu energy needs,academic
this paper presents new wireless and battery less industrial internet of things iiot devices powered by waste heat for measuring vibrations in rotative machines called indueye iiot,academic
these self powered devices will help huge energy demanding industries especially chemical petrochemical oil refineries etc,academic
to become more environmentally friendly and profitable in their digitalization process towards industry 4,academic
also these new industrial sensing devices take benefit of the new long range wireless protocols such as nb iot or lora that simply eliminate all the wireless infrastructure in the facility and its associated costs,academic
additionally the edge computing concept is introduced in the indueye iiot device decreasing to 98 of the cloud computation reducing in consequence the cloud computing carbon footprint and its associated fees,academic
the spectrum of tasks for health promotion has widened since the ottawa charter was signed,academic
in 1986 infectious diseases still seemed in retreat the potential extent of hiv aids was unrecognized the green revolution was at its height and global poverty appeared less intractable,academic
global climate change had not yet emerged as a major threat to development and health,academic
most economists forecast continuous improvement and chronic diseases were broadly anticipated as the next major health issue,academic
today although many broadly averaged measures of population health have improved many of the determinants of global health have faltered,academic
many infectious diseases have emerged others have unexpectedly reappeared,academic
reasons include urban crowding environmental changes altered sexual relations intensified food production and increased mobility and trade,academic
foremost however is the persistence of poverty and the exacerbation of regional and global inequality,academic
life expectancy has unexpectedly declined in several countries,academic
rather than being a faint echo from an earlier time of hardship these declines could signify the future,academic
relatedly the demographic and epidemiological transitions have faltered,academic
in some regions declining fertility has overshot that needed for optimal age structure whereas elsewhere mortality increases have reduced population growth rates despite continuing high fertility,academic
few if any millennium development goals mdg including those for health and sustainability seem achievable,academic
policy makers generally misunderstand the link between environmental sustainability mdg 7 and health,academic
many health workers also fail to realize that social cohesion and sustainability maintenance of the earth s ecological and geophysical systems is a necessary basis for health,academic
in sum these issues present an enormous challenge to health,academic
health promotion must address population health influences that transcend national boundaries and generations and engage with the development human rights and environmental movements,academic
the big task is to promote sustainable environmental and social conditions that bring enduring and equitable health gains,academic
colombia is currently one of the most promising countries with regard to its potential for agricultural development and for generating food supply for current and future human generations,academic

using modern technology there are open opportunities for the country in search of circular bio based economy strengthen its food sovereignty and to serve as an agricultural breadbasket to latin america and the world,academic
there is substantial evidence that airborne particulate matter pm contributes to haze acid rain global climate change and decreased life expectancy,academic
many recent studies have reported that a large fraction of airborne pm could be attributed to fugitive pm fpm,academic
the developing arid and semi arid regions in particular are facing the biggest brunt of fpm usually ascribed to the regionally transported dust,academic
on the other hand the rapid expansion of their metropolitan cities is contributing a considerable amount of locally induced fpm which makes it a prominent environmental and health stressor in these areas,academic
based on field measurements and dispersion modelling this thesis aims to i measure fpm from two common sources loose soils and non exhaust traffic in areas with arid desert climates ii derive representative emission models and iii assess their overall environmental and health impacts,academic
for this thesis on site measurements and samples of pm 10 µm diameter were collected,academic
source apportionment was performed to determine the contributions of individual sources,academic
dispersion modelling and regression analysis were used to derive emission models for loose calcisols a prominent soil in the subject areas and vehicle induced fpm vfpm,academic
finally our derived models were used along with the state of the art practices i,academic
regional emission models and the world health organization s who environmental burden of disease ebd method to determine the environmental and health impacts of local fpm,academic
several important findings were extracted from the above analysis i fpm from different origins contribute more than 60 of the urban pm in arid areas ii power law emission models with wind speed dependence were derived for loose calcisols soil iii emission factors were derived for vfpm using linear regression and were close to values reported in usa iv ebd estimates found that fpm may lead to 11,academic

p will a new born experience more impacts from climate change compared to a 60 year old,academic
while the obvious answer to this question is yes impacts accumulated across an average person 8217 s lifetime have so far not been quantified,academic
providing such information is however relevant and timely given the recent surge in societal debate regarding inter generational solidarity and considering ongoing climate litigation,academic
here we combine multi model impact projections from the inter sectoral impact model intercomparison project isimip with temperature trajectories from the ipcc special report on warming of 1,academic
5 176 c and life expectancy data from the world bank to compute accumulated impact exposure across lifetimes of people in different age groups and countries,academic
we consider six impacts categories droughts heatwaves tropical cyclones crop failure floods and wildfires for which isimip provides a total of 170 impact projections with 15 different impact models under rcp2,academic
6 and 6,academic
our results highlight that the combined increase in life expectancy and unfolding climate impacts leads to 2 4 times more impacts affecting a new born compared to a 60 year old person under current policy pledges,academic
globally the increase in exposure for young people is dominated by the strong increase in heatwave hazards,academic
the strongest increases occur in low and lower middle income countries where rising impacts compound a substantial increase in life expectancy,academic
our results overall highlight the strong benefit of aligning policies with the paris agreement for safeguarding the future of current young generations,academic
p the benefit of urban roadside trees to provide ecosystem services and wellbeing of human in expanding and compacted cities gets more and more attention,academic
for northern germany it is predicted that climate change rises summer temperatures and that precipitation patterns shift to drier vegetation periods,academic
in cities those impacts will intensify water soil sealing and heat problems urban heat island even more,academic
furthermore roadside trees have to deal with several specific site limitations like extreme soil compaction and soil sealing low water infiltration rates sandy and anthropogenic deposited substrates and soil volume restrictions,academic
the consequences for the trees are drought stress combined with reduced vitality and life expectancy,academic
p p our research is based on soil water monitoring at 17 roadside plantation sites across the city of hamburg,academic
160 we focus on the water availability of prepared planting soils and the development of the trees root systems,academic
sensors for soil water tension and soil temperature were installed in different soil areas of each site topsoil root ball tree pit substrate lateral space and subsoil,academic
the general goal of this study was to characterize the soil water availability at roadside planting pits during the first years after plantation here 2017 2018 and 2019,academic
based on these results the long term objective is to elaborate recommendations for the soil related technology of future urban tree planting sites,academic
the creation of more suitable conditions in the planting site enhances roadside tree vitality and provides ecosystem services by the trees on a higher level,academic
p p the data analysis focused on two main aspects,academic
first the effect of weather conditions especially 160 the extreme wet and dry vegetation periods on the soil water availability in the tree pit,academic
second the three year temporal development of soil water distribution in the different soil areas within the planting pitafter plantation,academic
p p we found that soil water availability in the vegetation period vp april october at the investigated roadside plantation sites are highly correlated to weather conditions air temperature at and precipitation p,academic
during a cold and wet vp at 14 0 176 c p 631 mm soil tensions reached a critical value on average at 24 177 18 days 11 177 9 of vp,academic
in a hot and dry vp at 16 0 176 c p 222 mm soil tensions reached a critical value on average at 115 177 22 days 54 177 10 of vp,academic
p p furthermore the results showed that soil water scarcity in the first vp occurred mainly in the root ball whereas during the second vp water scarcity developed in all soil areas within the planting site except for the subsoil,academic
although the amount of precipitation during the last vegetation period was more than doubled compared to the second the subsoil reached higher water tensions,academic
this finding leads to the conclusion that root development after plantation took place from the root ball over the prepared planting soil into the surrounding soil within depths of up to 1 m,academic
our global society has evolved in the last century at an astonishing pace with human population more than doubling in the last 50 years,academic
public health has been largely influenced in a positive way by the social and technological advancements that lead to a decrease in child mortality and an increase in life expectancy,academic
however the accelerated pace of climate change and its predicted impact on population health is one of the greatest challenges the human species faces,academic
there are many ways ph can contribute in that challenge from legislative action and advocacy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and toxic waste on a global scale to small projects that tackle locally specific problems,academic
this presentation is part of a workshop on how individuals and public health ph can create a more sustainable world,academic
it aims specifically to present examples and ideas of how to make current public health projects at a local level more sustainable,academic
several examples will be discussed during the presentation including the adherence to european directives like reducing the amount of paper used in projects and the focus on the environmental impacts of each program implemented creating a mindset of sustainability in all action,academic
there seems to be a global concern about climate change with many strategic documents and agreements outlining the path for a more sustainable world,academic
however there is also a clear difficulty in translating those strategies to action in our everyday public health practice,academic
the changes referred during this presentation might not be directly related to the main goal of the project or program yet they by contributing to climate action they will also contribute to population health gains,academic
we live in a time of unprecedented health transformation,academic
health disparities of all types rural age race and gender are steady if not increasing and for the first time in us history overall life expectancy is declining,academic
climate change opioid misuse and addiction integration of physical and behavioral health and persistent rates of chronic disease are both contemporary and emerging public health problems,academic
tackling these problems from the governmental public health perspective requires a competent adaptive diverse and engaged workforce,academic
we cannot expect to achieve heath improvement in communities nationwide without strong public health agencies built on a foundation of well trained and innovative public health practitioners,academic
building this foundation requires deliberate and thoughtful leadership robust strategic thinking and implementation and the resources needed to carry out public health s comprehensive mission,academic
there were no nationally representative data on the governmental public health agency workforce before 2014,academic
national data that were available were collected at the agency level,academic
while these surveys provided valuable insights into staffing levels budget changes and other important topics they did not capture the beliefs attitudes opinions and experiences of individual public health workers,academic
efforts to survey individual members of the governmental public health workforce were limited by differences in data collection methods time frames and questionnaire,academic
demographic indicators linked to general health have been strongly linked to economic development,academic
however change in such indicators is also associated with other factors such as climate water availability and diet,academic
here we use a systems modelling approach bringing together a range of environmental economic dietary and health factors to seek possible dominant causes of demographic change across africa,academic
a continent wide north south transect of countries allows for the exploration of a range of climates while a longitudinal transect from the atlantic to the red sea provides a range of socio economic factors within the similar climatic regime of sahelian africa,academic
while change in national life expectancy and death rate since 1960 is modelled to be linked to a varying number and type of factors across the transects the dominant factor in improving these demographic indicators across the continent is food availability,academic
this has been strongly modulated by hiv infection rates in recent decades in some countries,academic
abstract the continuing process of urbanization sets up urgent issues of environmental degradation resulting in disrupting opportunities to enhance quality of life of the population,academic
in ukraine the anthropogenic and human impacts on the environment are several times higher than in developed countries,academic
thus life expectancy in ukraine is on average around 68 years e,academic
in italy 82 sweden 80 poland 74 which is largely due to the environmental pollution which is the result of production activities of mining metallurgy chemical industries fuel and energy complex,academic
therefore there is a strong need in the ukrainian society to address the consequences of powerful external forces as environmental pollution and climate change and internal forces as socioeconomic development,academic
these forces play a role at all levels but are prevalent at urban levels,academic
cities are not isolated entities they interact with their surroundings economically socio politically and environmentally,academic
urban development toward sustainability has to consider the capacity of the entire ecosystem to support such development including the prevention and mitigation of adverse environmental impacts of the outside urban areas,academic
hence cities are unique territories to implement green economy opportunities to ensure the development of sustainable societies,academic
exploring different dimensions of sustainability should be connected with the exploration of urban processes and developments on a global level,academic
this connection shows how sustainability can be destroyed or ensured,academic
sustainability should be based on social cohesion in local urban areas and contribute to sustainable urban development,academic

population growth globalization climate change and urbanization together are reshaping the context upon which we must consider the global spread of emerging and historically tropical infectious diseases and their interface with non communicable diseases of transitioning societies,academic
we live on a crowded and interconnected planet with a projected global human population of at least 9 billion by 2050 1,academic
public health advances such as safe water adequate sanitation antibiotics vaccines and balanced nutrition programs have extended overall life expectancy even in remote under developed settings,academic
the resulting unprecedented population surge has contributed to numerous challenges that will increasingly serve as counter balances to these public health advances and will synergize with other inter related factors such globalization climate change and urbanization to contribute to the spread of dangerous infectious diseases,academic
international travel and immigration increase each year with more than 1 billion humans crossing international borders in 2013 alone 2,academic

exotic remote and dangerous locations often lacking public health infrastructure are increasingly common destinations for travelers as well as sources of immigrants to the developed world,academic

since the seminal discoveries of the relationship between the underlying genetic mutation and the altered expression of gpi linked antigen expression that underlies the pathobiology of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria pnh flow cytometry and the immunophenotypic detection of pnh clones has played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis monitoring and clinical management of patients with pnh 1 3,academic
with the successful introduction of complement blockade therapies for pnh 4 the condition has changed from one with a poor outcome 5 to one where life expectancy matches that of the normal population 6,academic
with complement blockade therapies well established for pnh and more alternatives on the horizon diagnosis of pnh and monitoring of treatment efficacy has never been more important given the particularly high cost of therapy,academic
since the publication in 2010 of the international clinical cytometry society iccs consensus guidelines for detection of pnh by flow cytometry 7 a significant climate change in the provenance of clinical flow cytometry testing in general has occurred,academic
contemporary guidelines are now driven by the expectations that clinical flow cytometry laboratories will work to iso15189 standards or national regulatory requirements that require documented validation of all tests offered,academic
furthermore regulatory bodies and other stakeholders now require validation of methods used for clinical trials where flow cytometry methods are used for diagnosis to monitor responses to therapy or define clinical endpoints,academic
on this background of accreditation and validation professional societies such as iccs and escca are now actively enlisting expertise to produce practical guidelines that address all aspects of clinical flow cytometry assays,academic
in this edition of clinical cytometry four articles are presented that provide an updated and significantly improved comprehensive practical guide to pnh testing,academic
in the first of these dezern and borowitz 8 present a detailed account of the role of pnh testing and how it contributes to the diagnosis classification and monitoring of patients,academic
when interpreted correctly the results from pnh flow cytometry testing including presence and size of the clonal populations and the cell types involved can allow the clinician to classify the disease appropriately evaluate the risk of disease progression and subsequently monitor response to therapy,academic
the second section of these updated iccs pnh consensus guidelines concentrates on specific instrument setup for pnh assays together with the identification and testing of appropriate antibody conjugates 9,academic
assay design is also covered in great detail and underlines principles that can be transferred to other immunophenotyping procedures,academic
in part 3 illingworth et al,academic
offer practical guidance on the analysis and reporting of pnh results using a fully optimized assay 10,academic
they also address the most common analytical challenges for accurate reporting of results,academic
furthermore the authors supply an extensive case library to assist in the interpretation of more difficult cases drawn from their many years of experience,academic
in the final section oldaker et al,academic
not only provide a comprehensive guide on how to validate the flow cytometric procedures described in parts 2 and 3 but also detail the differences between cell based and traditional soluble analyte assay validations 11,academic
the procedures described are based on the recommendations of a number of stakeholders who provide external guidance and general recommendations together with the published experience of experts in the area of pnh testing,academic
the overall goal is to provide practical assay specific guidelines for the validation of high sensitivity flow cytometric pnh assays,academic
for clinical laboratories it is important recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the complex process of assay development optimization and validation processes has to be the patient,academic
for a rare disease such as pnh diagnostic testing with the knowledge that an assay has been through a comprehensive validation process is critically important,academic
when a new diagnosis of pnh is made this can have life changing and potentially lifelong implications for individual patients,academic
these updated and comprehensive guidelines for pnh testing are the result of many hours of dedication from all contributors,academic

life expectancy reflects the health of a country,academic
as countries improve their health systems longevity predictions rise mainly through the provision of basic public health facilities which decrease infant mortality rates and universal health coverage which reduces premature deaths in adults,academic
however the forecasting of life expectancy is far more complex than assessing levels of health care and has to contend with economic fortunes political interventions climate change as well as behavioural and social trends such as smoking obesity exercise and drugs,academic
even religious gender and belief issues can sway calculations so data collection has to be from multiple sources and their interpretation pooled,academic

it is an actuarially dense piece with the highlights summarised as follows,academic
climate change and increasing temperatures are a global phenomenon that can influence the dynamics of a number of hematophagous arthropods vectors of pathogens with importance in human and veterinary medicine,academic
in fact climatic changes together with an increase in the movement of dogs across europe have caused an increase in the geographical range of dirofilaria immitis and d,academic
a geographic information system based on thermal regimen was constructed to identify areas potentially suitable for dirofilaria transmission in europe,academic
these models are based on evidence that i there is a threshold of 14 c below which dirofilaria development will not proceed in mosquitoes ii there is a requirement of 130 growing degree days for larvae to reach infectivity and iii there is a maximum life expectancy of 30 days for a mosquito vector,academic
the output of these models predicted that the summer temperatures with peaks in july and august are sufficient to facilitate extrinsic incubation of dirofilaria even at high latitudes,academic
recently an additional model was constructed to verify the influence of temperature in the course of three decades 1980 1989 1990 1999 and 2000 2012 on the risk of infection by dirofilaria in italy,academic
the results showed an expected increasing trend of temperatures an increase of the dirofilaria generation numbers into the mosquitoes and a significant extension of the infection risk from 5 6 months 1980 1989 to 6,academic
5 months 1990 1999 up to more than 7 months 2000 20012,academic
these findings show that geospatial tools are very useful for mapping monitoring forecasting and surveillance of both heartworm and subcutaneous dirofilariasis,academic
people spend most of the time indoors so indoor temperatures and air quality are important,academic
there is growing evidence that retrofitting insulation in existing houses improves health wellbeing and life expectancy as well as having many cobenefits including reducing fuel poverty increasing energy efficiency and mitigating climate change,academic

this chapter summarizes the broad outcomes of several large scale retrofit insulation and heating programs before analyzing the different policy frameworks that have been used to justify retrofitted insulation policies,academic
government policies to encourage motorists to switch to diesel engines may have backfired experts have said as diesel fumes are now being blamed for the poor air quality in uk cities that is damaging health and reducing life expectancy,academic
successive governments have encouraged a switch to diesel powered transport in a bid to tackle climate change because diesel vehicles are more fuel efficient and emit less carbon dioxide than those powered by petrol,academic
drivers have been keen to make the switch because diesel vehicles are more economical to run and more than half of new cars are now diesel,academic
however diesel engines produce tiny particulate matter which is an important contributor to poor air quality in uk cities,academic
as well as exacerbating conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease particulate matter is estimated to be responsible for 29 000 deaths each year in the united kingdom and,academic
atmospheric aerosol plays an important role in radiation budget climate change hydrology and visibility,academic
however it has immense effect on the air quality especially in densely populated areas where high concentration of aerosol is associated with premature death and the decrease of life expectancy,academic
therefore an accurate estimation of aerosol with spatial distribution is essential and satellite data has increasingly been used to estimate aerosol optical depth aod,academic
aerosol product aod from moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer modis data is available at global scale but problems arise due to low spatial resolution time lag availability of aod product as well as the use of generalized aerosol models in retrieval algorithm instead of local aerosol models,academic
this study focuses on the aerosol retrieval algorithm for the characterization of local aerosol in hong kong for a long period of time 2006 2011 using high spatial resolution modis level 1b data 500 m resolution and taking into account the local aerosol models,academic
two methods dark dense vegetation and modis land surface reflectance product were used for the estimation of the surface reflectance over land and santa barbara disort radiative transfer sbdart code was used to construct luts for calculating the aerosol reflectance as a function of aod,academic
results indicate that aod can be estimated at the local scale from high resolution modis data and the obtained accuracy ca,academic

all around us we see the remarkable advances that petrochemical technologies have brought to humankind and our society,academic
life expectancy economic advancement and global mobility are all striking examples of the benefits of real ingenuity and innovation over many decades in the science and technological utilisation of fossil fuels,academic
one also recognises that society s current energy trajectory is not sustainable this trajectory is running alongside the critical issues of human induced climate change and potential ecological destruction,academic
the petrochemical sector is now rising to the challenge of global energy sustainability,academic
the sector also needs to be more energy efficient with mounting pressure on rising feedstock prices and ever increasing regulatory and commercial requirements,academic
the kacst oxford forum the first of its kind attempted to address many of these issues facing the petrochemical technologies,academic
it also recognised the special responsibilities that saudi arabia has as the world s leading petroleum and petrochemical production centre,academic
our 1st kacst oxford forum therefore targeted not only the challenge of building the future of petrochemical technologies in a sustainable way but also to highlight the new and exciting opportunities that such an approach brings,academic
thus whilst recognising the critical need for the development of alternative energy technologies our vision is that the world is equally served in the short and medium terms by real advances and real innovation in developing cleaner more efficient and more economic petrochemical production and conversion technologies,academic
five major thematic areas were covered,academic
recently le bohec et al,academic
1 inferred that king penguins aptenodytes patagonicus are at heavy extinction risk under current global warming predictions,academic
although their demographic modeling was elegant they based further inferences on results showing that warm el nino southern oscillation events negatively affect both breeding success and adult survival,academic
although the results are interesting we here warn against conclusions that are probably too strong,academic
first king penguin populations including the one studied by le bohec et al,academic
have increased exponentially since the 1960s 2 3 despite coincident warming of the northern southern ocean 4 today its world population totals 1,academic
5 million breeding pairs,academic
second evidence exists for density dependence in this species population growth rate 3 which may affect its response to climate change,academic
third described relationships are derived from short time series breeding success 6 years adult survival 8 years relative to the species 30 year life expectancy analogous to the closely related emperor penguin aptenodytes forsteri,academic
such time series are too short to evaluate temporal variation without sampling error and extinction risk has not been evaluated with mechanistic population models,academic
finally the temporary warming of el nino may not be a surrogate for long term climate effects because the southern annular mode has been locked in its positive state duplicating la nina conditions since the mid 1970s contributing greatly to climate effects observed thus far 5,academic
although le bohec et al,academic
clearly demonstrate that ocean environment affects seabirds a now well documented topic longer time series and comprehensive population models are needed for more robust conclusions,academic
the most significant factors increasing demand for services and supports for people with intellectual disability are growth in national population and changes in the demographic structure of the population particularly aging lakin stancliffe 2005,academic
in addition to the increasing proportion of elderly adults in the general population specific examples of important demographic change include the effects of increased life expectancy of people with intellectual disability bittles et al,academic
2002 yang rasmussen friedman 2002 and related survival rates of low and very low birth weight infants and the aging of family caregivers with whom many adults with intellectual disability currently live,academic
this paper deals with growth in residential services in australia and the united states us for people with intellectual disability as it relates to one of these factors national population growth,academic
in a climate of substantial unmet need australian institute of health and welfare aihw 2002 prouty smith lakin 2004 real growth in residential services is required if unmet need for these services is to be addressed,academic
as national population increases so too does the population of people with intellectual disability resulting in an increased absolute level of demand for intellectual disability services even if the proportion of people receiving services remains unchanged,academic
real growth in residential services requires that the rate of growth in residential provision is faster than the growth rate for national population,academic
to identify the extent of real growth in residential services known as accommodation support services in australia we compared annual changes in service provision with growth of national population in australia and the united states since 1997,academic
these data are shown in figs,academic
1 and 2 respectively,academic
australian data fig,academic
1 are shown only to 2002 because the method of data collection changed thereafter from the previous annual snapshot data collections so that 2003 data are not comparable to earlier data,academic
note that the slopes of all the lines in figs,academic
1 and 2 are directly comparable to one another because all the y axes have a data range of 20 of the minimum value for that axis,academic
population data show the national population on june 30 of each year,academic
us residential service data fig,academic
2 are a snapshot point census from june 30 each year,academic
australian residential service data fig,academic
1 are also from a snapshot day during the year,academic
both national data sets exclude respite places,academic
background and aims the literature concerning impending energy insecurity food prices and climate change is growing rapidly,academic
these problems reflect manifestations of limits to growth including climate change though what is limited in this case is not carbon emissions but the capacity of earth to absorb waste gases without great harm to the climate ecology and ultimately civilisation hence health,academic
limits to growth interact,academic
for example rising energy prices lift fertiliser costs and divert agricultural capacity from food to fuel,academic
climate change impairs crop yields and harms nutrition synergistically in other ways such as by reducing water quality,academic
collectively the diverse phenomena of limits to growth will place increasing and eventually immense strain on the capacity of global public health services to maintain global life expectancy especially given the background of rising population size,academic
methods a limited literature search was conducted in health journals using pubmed google scholar and specific journals searching for the following terms peak oil energy scarcity limits to growth ecological footprint global environmental change peak health peak phosphorus and civilisation collapse,academic
the term climate change was excluded because the research question studied here is broader,academic
results within the broader medical and public health literature there is a limited awareness of peak oil however papers are mainly restricted to or in response to one research group,academic
in the epidemiological literature including environmental epidemiology these topics are scarcely mentioned apart from several articles in the mid 1990s,academic
conclusions rising energy prices and other manifestations of limits to growth are important environmental determinants of health,academic
environmental epidemiologists need to urgently consider these dimensions and to embrace interdisciplinary approaches to consider how to prevent what homer dixon calls synchronous failure,academic
life expectancy and health differ greatly between emerging and developed countries and within countries,academic
global dependence on fossil fuels contributes to health inequalities through air pollution the geopolitics of scarce resources and probable climate change arising from global warming,academic
substituting for fossil fuels c hydrogen h2 as vector and store of energy produced from low carbon and or renewable sources could reduce health inequalities by improving the environment,academic
it is unlikely that the global market would initiate such a change,academic
nation states would not act alone and would need to cooperate in leading it,academic
global recession might be the incentive that is needed to restructure a c economy into an h2 economy,academic
yet the transition would carry high costs which would have to be borne by the developed countries in order to achieve a new treaty that included emerging countries,academic
h2 for c is thus not only a technical fix but also a global ethical choice,academic
the in conversation boundary spanners thinkers and policy actors round table series provides a platform for researchers policy actors and implementation experts to elevate discussion on emerging issues present new and upcoming research and facilitate conversations around impacts and possible solutions,academic
this brief report on trees climate change and health reflects a conversation between the authors of this paper along with supporting literature,academic
it explores the potential of green spaces and trees as a viable strategy to address climate change challenges and simultaneously improve population health well being and health equity,academic
in particular it highlights the public health benefits of trees and green space the challenges faced in urban areas and opportunities for the protection maintenance and regeneration of urban green space,academic
climate change is a global problem which affects the various geographical regions at different levels,academic
it is also associated with a wide range of human health problems which pose a burden to health systems especially in regions such as africa,academic
indeed across the african continent public health systems are under severe pressure partly due to their fragile socioeconomic conditions,academic
this paper reports on a cross sectional study in six african countries ghana nigeria south africa namibia ethiopia and kenya aimed at assessing their vulnerabilities to climate change focusing on its impacts on human health,academic
the study evaluated the levels of information knowledge and perceptions of public health professionals,academic
it also examined the health systems preparedness to cope with these health hazards the available resources and those needed to build resilience to the country s vulnerable population as perceived by health professionals,academic
the results revealed that 63,academic
1 of the total respondents reported that climate change had been extensively experienced in the past years while 32 claimed that the sampled countries had experienced them to some extent,academic
nigerian respondents recorded the highest levels 67,academic
7 followed by kenya with 66,academic
south africa had the lowest level of impact as perceived by the respondents 50,academic
0 when compared with the other sampled countries,academic
all respondents from ghana and namibia reported that health problems caused by climate change are common in the two countries,academic
as perceived by the health professionals the inadequate resources reiterate the need for infrastructural resources medical equipment emergency response resources and technical support,academic
the study s recommendations include the need to improve current policies at all levels i,academic
national regional and local on climate change and public health and to strengthen health professionals skills,academic
improving the basic knowledge of health institutions to better respond to a changing climate is also recommended,academic
the study provides valuable insights which may be helpful to other nations in sub saharan africa,academic
climate change is inseparably linked to human health,academic
although there is growing awareness of the threats to human health caused by climate change it remains unclear how the german population perceives the relevance of climate change and its health consequences,academic
between may and september 2022 german residents were invited to participate in a cross sectional online survey that explored three content areas 1 the relevance of climate change 2 health risks in connection with climate change and 3 collective and individual options for action against climate change,academic
a total of 697 full data sets were collected for analysis 72 female 51 55 years old,academic
the majority of participants agreed that human induced climate change exists 85 and that it has an impact on human health 83,academic
they also perceived the global population to be more strongly impacted by climate change than themselves 89 versus 68,academic
most participants 76 claimed to personally contribute to climate protection and 23 felt that their city or council contributed to climate protection,academic
although the majority of participants saw climate change as a threat to human health they perceived other population groups to be most strongly affected,academic
cognitive dissonance might explain this lack of individual concern and one approach to addressing such distorted perceptions might be the dissemination of appropriate risk communication with health professionals involved in the communication,academic
the consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly evident and highlight the important interdependence between the well being of people and ecosystems,academic
although climate change is a global phenomenon its causes and consequences vary dramatically across territories and population groups,academic
among settings particularly susceptible to health impacts from climate change are cities with a mediterranean climate,academic
here impacts will put additional pressure on already stressed ecosystems and vulnerable economies and societies increasing health inequalities,academic
therefore this article presents and discusses a conceptual framework for understanding the complex relationship between climate change and health in the context of cities with mediterranean climate from a social and climate justice approach,academic
the different elements that integrate the conceptual framework are 1 the determinants of climate change 2 its environmental and social consequences 3 its direct and indirect impacts on health and 4 the role of mitigation and adaptation policies,academic
the model places special emphasis on the associated social and health inequalities through 1 the recognition of the role of systems of privilege and oppression 2 the distinction between structural and intermediate determinants of climate change at the root of health inequalities 3 the role of individual and collective vulnerability in mediating the effects of climate change on health and 4 the need to act from a climate justice perspective to reverse health inequities,academic
greenhouse gases emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels are worsening air quality and affecting the climate system,academic
while climate change impacts on meteorological variables affects air quality by altering the concentration and distribution of pollutants air pollution significantly influences the climate leading to negative impacts on human health,academic
due to the combination of high temperatures air pollution and high population density cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts,academic
the planning and design of public spaces aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation can result in multiple co benefits for human health while reducing social inequalities,academic
to address the major research gaps in the communication between health and planning experts and the lack of capacity among public sectors and policy makers it is necessary to promote capacity building and knowledge sharing between the planning and health sectors,academic
the purpose of this article is to develop preliminary recommendations for a process that allows a comprehensive assessment of the interlinkages between climate and health social environmental and economic vulnerabilities and the quality of the urban spaces to support local governments policymakers and education institutions in making informed decisions for public spaces,academic
the methods applied were a literature review and interviews with experts,academic
potential health risks due to climate change are not entirely unanticipated and have been warned of by scientists and researchers for decades,academic
as the effects of climate become more pronounced there is growing evidence of its severe impact on human health,academic
this paper will focus on the indicators specific health issues the people who are affected the most and various companies initiatives towards alleviating this issue,academic
a growing number of health authorities around the world are conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments however few explore impacts and adaptations related to mental health,academic
we argue for an expanded conceptualization of health that includes both the physiological and psychological aspects of climate change and health,academic
through a review of the global literature on mental health and climate change this analytical review explores how mental health can be integrated into climate change and health vulnerability assessments and concludes with recommendations for integrating mental health within climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments,academic
abstract background climate change affects human health with those with the least resources being most vulnerable,academic
however little is known about the impact of climate change on human health and effective adaptation methods in informal settlements in low and middle income countries,academic
objective the objective of this scoping review was to identify characterize and summarize research evidence on the impact of climate change on human health in informal settlements and the available adaptation methods and interventions,academic
method a scoping review was conducted using the arksey and o malley framework,academic
the four bibliographic databases pubmed web of science embase and the cochrane library were searched,academic
eligibility criteria were all types of peer reviewed publications reporting on climate change or related extreme weather events as defined by the united nations framework convention on climate change informal settlements as defined by un habitat low and middle income countries as defined by the world bank and immediate human health impacts,academic
review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined form,academic
results out of 1197 studies initially identified 15 articles were retained,academic
we found nine original research articles and six reviews commentaries and editorials,academic
the articles were reporting on the exposures flooding temperature changes and perceptions of climate change with health outcomes broadly categorized as mental health communicable diseases and non communicable diseases,academic
six studies had a geographical focus on asia four on africa and one on south america the remaining four articles had no geographical focus,academic
one article investigated an adaptation method for heat exposure,academic
serval other adaptation methods were proposed though they were not investigated by the articles in this review,academic
conclusion there is a paucity of original research and solid study designs,academic
further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the impact the most effective adaptation methods and to inform policy making,academic
this research was aimed at providing evidence on climate change and health knowledge among adolescents,academic
a cross sectional study was conducted in yogyakarta city from june to september 2016,academic
a structured questionnaire was used to collect data among 508 adolescents who were in the second grade of a senior high school,academic
this study revealed that participants had a low and inconsistent understanding regarding climate change and its impact on health,academic
they reported that they prefer to get climate change information via talking with family,academic
in summary adolescent knowledge regarding climate change and health needs to improve with proper content and appropriate media,academic
the impacts of climate change on human health have been observed and projected in the philippines as vector borne and heat related diseases have and continue to increase,academic
as a response the philippine government has given priority to climate change and health as one of the main research funding topics,academic
to guide in identifying more specific research topics a scoping review was done to complement the agenda setting process by mapping out the extent of climate change and health research done in the country,academic
research articles and grey literature published from 1980 to 2017 were searched from online databases and search engines and a total of 34 quantitative studies were selected,academic
fifty three percent of the health topics studied were about mosquito borne diseases particularly dengue fever,academic
seventy nine percent of the studies reported evidence of positive associations between climate factors and health outcomes,academic
recommended broad research themes for funding were health vulnerability health adaptation and co benefits,academic
other notable recommendations were the development of open data and reproducible modeling schemes,academic
in conclusion the scoping review was useful in providing a background for research agenda setting however additional analyses or consultations should be complementary for added depth,academic
the climate change and health adaptation program cchap is a program within the first nations inuit health branch of indigenous services canada which was previously under the responsibility of health canada,academic
the cchap supports inuit and first nation communities in mitigating and adapting to the health impacts of climate change,academic
the impacts of climate change on indigenous health can be observed in multiple areas including but not limited to food security cultural medicines mental health and landbased practices,academic
this program seeks to address the needs of climate change and health in first nation and inuit communities to support resiliency and adaptation to a changing climate both now and in the future through its emphasis on youth and capacity building,academic
the commentary is based on the program s eleven years of experience working with and for indigenous communities and provides an overview of the cchap model and the work it has and continues to support,academic
this paper demonstrates three examples of community based projects to mitigate and adapt to the health impacts of climate change to demonstrate climate change resiliency within indigenous communities,academic
our climate is changing at an unprecedented rate,academic
this not only has impacts on the planet and the ecosystem with extinction rates rising rapidly but also on human health figure 1,academic
the effects of climate change are and will continue to disrupt the basic requirements for health such as clean water clean air adequate food and will furthermore exacerbate underlying social economic and ecological,academic
this article examines how social and health inequalities shape the health impacts of climate change in the uk and what the implications are for climate change adaptation and health care provision,academic
the evidence generated by the other articles of the special issue were interpreted using social justice reasoning in light of additional literature to draw out the key implications of health and social inequalities for health outcomes of climate change,academic
exposure to heat and cold air pollution pollen food safety risks disruptions to access to and functioning of health services and facilities emerging infections and flooding are examined as the key impacts of climate change influencing health outcomes,academic
age pre existing medical conditions and social deprivation are found to be the key but not only factors that make people vulnerable and to experience more adverse health outcomes related to climate change impacts,academic
in the future climate change aging population and decreasing public spending on health and social care may aggravate inequality of health outcomes related to climate change,academic
health education and public preparedness measures that take into account differential exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different groups help address health and social inequalities to do with climate change,academic
adaptation strategies based on individual preparedness action and behaviour change may aggravate health and social inequalities due to their selective uptake unless they are coupled with broad public information campaigns and financial support for undertaking adaptive measures,academic
a climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment was conducted in dominica a caribbean small island developing state located in the lesser antilles,academic
the assessment revealed that the country s population is already experiencing many impacts on health and health systems from climate variability and change,academic
infectious diseases as well as food and waterborne diseases pose continued threats as climate change may exacerbate the related health risks,academic
threats to food security were also identified with particular concern for food production systems,academic
the findings of the assessment included near term and long term adaptation options that can inform actions of health sector decision makers in addressing health vulnerabilities and building resilience to climate change,academic
key challenges include the need for enhanced financial and human resources to build awareness of key health risks and increase adaptive capacity,academic
other small island developing states interested in pursuing a vulnerability and adaptation assessment may find this assessment approach key findings analysis and lessons learned useful,academic
climate change could have a devastating effect on human and environmental health,academic
potential effects of climate change on human health include higher rates of respiratory and heat related illness increased prevalence of vector borne and waterborne diseases food and water insecurity and malnutrition,academic
persons who are elderly sick or poor are especially vulnerable to these potential consequences,academic
addressing climate change could have substantial benefits to human health,academic
in this position paper the american college of physicians acp recommends that physicians and the broader health care community throughout the world engage in environmentally sustainable practices that reduce carbon emissions support efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change and educate the public their colleagues their community and lawmakers about the health risks posed by climate change,academic
tackling climate change is an opportunity to dramatically improve human health and avert dire environmental outcomes and acp believes that physicians can play a role in achieving this goal,academic
the 2023 global initiative for chronic obstructive lung disease gold report includes relevant topics from the clinician s perspective and evidence published on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd since gold 2017,academic
the world health organization who and gold 2023 have developed an updated definition of copd as a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms dyspnea cough expectoration exacerbations due to abnormalities of the airway bronchitis bronchiolitis and or alveoli emphysema that cause persistent often progressive airflow obstruction,academic
gold 2023 includes recommendations for copd patients diagnosed with covid 19 and acknowledges the role of reduced air quality in the etiology and progression of copd,academic
in may 2023 the gold scientific committee on air pollution and copd reported that air pollution increasingly contributes to the pathogenesis of copd,academic
this editorial aims to introduce the updated gold 2023 report in the context of climate change and the aftermath of the covid 19 pandemic,academic
a growing body of literature addresses how climate change is likely to have substantial and generally adverse effects on population health and health systems around the world,academic
these effects are likely to vary within and between countries and importantly will vary depending on different socioeconomic development patterns,academic
transitioning to a more resilient and sustainable world to prepare for and manage the effects of climate change is likely to result in better health outcomes,academic
sustained fossil fuel development will likely result in continued high burdens of preventable conditions such as undernutrition malaria and diarrheal diseases,academic
using a new set of socioeconomic development trajectories the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps along with the world health organization s operational framework for building climate resilient health systems we extend existing storylines to illustrate how various aspects of health systems are likely to be affected under each ssp,academic
we also discuss the implications of our findings on how the burden of mortality and the achievement of health related sustainable development goal targets are likely to vary under different ssps,academic
background bangladesh is facing the unavoidable challenge of adaptation to climate change,academic
however very little is known in relation to climate change and health,academic
this article provides information on potential climate change impact on health magnitude of climate sensitive diseases and baseline scenarios of health systems to climate variability and change,academic
design a cross sectional study using multistage cluster sampling framework was conducted in 2012 among 6 720 households of 224 rural villages in seven vulnerable districts of bangladesh,academic
information was obtained from head of the households using a pretested interviewer administered structured questionnaire,academic
a total of 6 720 individuals participated in the study with written informed consent,academic
results the majority of the respondents were from the low income vulnerable group 60 farmers or day labourers with an average of 30 years stay in their locality,academic
most of them 96 had faced extreme weather events 45 of people had become homeless and displaced for a mean duration of 38 days in the past 10 years,academic
almost all of the respondents 97,academic
8 believe that health care expenditure increased after the extreme weather events,academic
mean annual total health care expenditure was 6 555 bangladeshi taka bdt 1 usd 77 bdt in 2015 and exclusively out of pocket of the respondents,academic
incidence of dengue was 1,academic
29 95 ci 0,academic
56 and malaria 13,academic
86 95 ci 6,academic
01 per 1 000 adult population for 12 months preceding the data collection,academic
incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia among under five children of the households for the preceding month was 10,academic

66 and 7,academic
3 95 ci 6,academic
conclusions the findings of this survey indicate that climate change has a potential adverse impact on human health in bangladesh,academic
the magnitude of malaria dengue childhood diarrhoea and pneumonia was high among the vulnerable communities,academic
community based adaptation strategy for health could be beneficial to minimise climate change attributed health burden of bangladesh,academic
this paper explores evidence relevant to the hypothesis that human generated climate change global warming is already and will increasingly add to the existing burden of disadvantage experienced by populations in low income countries the global south,academic
well recognised health manifestations of global warming include from heatwaves and other extreme weather events changes to infectious disease patterns and undernutrition arising from higher food prices reduced food availability and reduced nutrient concentrations of many foods,academic
these effects have been called primary and secondary,academic
although these manifestations will have effects globally their biggest impact on health is and will be upon poor and vulnerable populations in low income settings,academic
also well recognised manual labourers are increasingly vulnerable from excessive heat and humidity,academic
there is less recognition that climate change interacts with social and political determinants of health contributing to tertiary health consequences including conflict forced migration and famine,academic
in turn these effects may deepen poverty traps in the global south,academic
human generated climate change is principally caused by the policies and lifestyles of populations in high income countries the global north,academic
the recent recognition by the british government that climate change is an emergency is encouraging and may help motivate the widespread global behavioural changes that are needed to reduce the many risks from global warming including to the people of the south,academic
the translation of science from research to real world change is a central goal of public health,academic
communication has an essential role to play in provoking a response to climate change,academic
it must first raise awareness make people feel involved and ultimately motivate them to take action,academic
the goal of this research is to understand how the information related to this issue is being addressed and disseminated to different audiences public citizens politicians and key climate change stakeholders,academic
initial results show that the scientific voice struggles to globally highlight this issue to a general audience and that messages that address the topic do not meet the challenges going from a dramatic framing to a basic adaptation framing,academic
communication experts can help inform scientists and policy makers on how to best share information about climate change in an engaging and motivating way,academic
this study gives an insight about the key role of the media and communications in addressing themes relating to climate change and transmitting information to the public in order to take action,academic
we created a measure to help comprehend population vulnerability to potential flooding and excessive heat events using health built environment and social factors,academic
through principal component analysis pca we created non weighted sum index scores of literature reviewed social and built environment characteristics,academic
we created baseline poor health measures using 1999 2005 age adjusted cardiovascular and combined diabetes and hypertension mortality rates to correspond with social built environment indices,academic
we mapped us census block groups by linked age adjusted mortality and a pca created social built environment index,academic
the goal was to measure flooding and excessive heat event vulnerability as proxies for population vulnerability to climate change for travis county texas,academic
this assessment identified communities where baseline poor health social marginalisation and built environmental impediments intersected,academic
such assessments may assist targeted interventions and improve emergency preparedness in identified vulnerable communities while fostering resilience through the focus of climate change adaptation policies at the local level,academic
the american thoracic society ats in collaboration with george mason university surveyed a random sample of ats members to assess their perceptions of clinical experiences with and preferred policy responses to climate change,academic
an e mail containing an invitation from the ats president and a link to an online survey was sent to 5 500 randomly selected u,academic
members up to four reminder e mails were sent to nonrespondents,academic
responses were received from members in 49 states and the district of columbia n 915 the response rate was 17,academic
geographic distribution of respondents mirrored that of the sample,academic
survey estimates confidence intervals were 3,academic
5 or smaller,academic
results indicate that a large majority of ats members have concluded that climate change is happening 89 that it is driven by human activity 68 and that it is relevant to patient care a great deal a moderate amount 65,academic
a majority of respondents indicated they were already observing health impacts of climate change among their patients most commonly as increases in chronic disease severity from air pollution 77 allergic symptoms from exposure to plants or mold 58 and severe weather injuries 57,academic
a larger majority anticipated seeing these climate related health impacts in the next 2 decades,academic
respondents indicated that physicians and physician organizations should play an active role in educating patients the public and policy makers on the human health effects of climate change,academic
overall ats members are observing that human health is already adversely affected by climate change and support responses to address this situation,academic
linking environmental socioeconomic and health datasets provides new insights into the potential associations between climate change and human health and wellbeing and underpins the development of decision support tools that will promote resilience to climate change and thus enable more effective adaptation,academic
this paper outlines the challenges and opportunities presented by advances in data collection storage analysis and access particularly focusing on data mashups,academic
these data mashups are integrations of different types and sources of data frequently using open application programming interfaces and data sources to produce enriched results that were not necessarily the original reason for assembling the raw source data,academic
as an illustration of this potential this paper describes a recently funded initiative to create such a facility in the uk for use in decision support around climate change and health and provides examples of suitable sources of data and the purposes to which they can be directed particularly for policy makers and public health decision makers,academic
environmental impacts of energy use can impose large costs on society,academic
we quantify and monetize the life cycle climate change and health effects of greenhouse gas ghg and fine particulate matter pm2,academic
5 emissions from gasoline corn ethanol and cellulosic ethanol,academic
for each billion ethanol equivalent gallons of fuel produced and combusted in the us the combined climate change and health costs are 469 million for gasoline 472 952 million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source natural gas corn stover or coal and technology but only 123 208 million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock prairie biomass miscanthus corn stover or switchgrass,academic
moreover a geographically explicit life cycle analysis that tracks pm2,academic
5 emissions and exposure relative to u,academic
population shows regional shifts in health costs dependent on fuel production systems,academic
because cellulosic ethanol can offer health benefits from pm2,academic
5 reduction that are of comparable importance to its climate change benefits from ghg reduction a shift from gasoline to cellulosic ethanol has greater advantages than previously recognized,academic
these advantages are critically dependent on the source of land used to produce biomass for biofuels on the magnitude of any indirect land use that may result and on other as yet unmeasured environmental impacts of biofuels,academic
the impacts of climate change on human health have been documented globally and in the united states,academic
numerous studies project greater morbidity and mortality as a result of extreme weather events and other climate sensitive hazards,academic
public health impacts on the u,academic
gulf coast may be severe as the region is expected to experience increases in extreme temperatures sea level rise and possibly fewer but more intense hurricanes,academic
through myriad pathways climate change is likely to make the gulf coast less hospitable and more dangerous for its residents and may prompt substantial migration from and into the region,academic
public health impacts may be further exacerbated by the concentration of people and infrastructure as well as the region s coastal geography,academic
vulnerable populations including the very young elderly and socioeconomically disadvantaged may face particularly high threats to their health and well being,academic
this paper provides an overview of potential public health impacts of climate variability and change on the gulf coast with a focus on the region s unique vulnerabilities and outlines recommendations for improving the region s ability to minimize the impacts of climate sensitive hazards,academic
public health adaptation aimed at improving individual public health system and infrastructure resilience is urgently needed to meet the challenges climate change may pose to the gulf coast in the coming decades,academic
what emerging public health threat is complex multifaceted dynamic has the potential to get much worse and won t be eliminated any time soon,academic
if you answered terrorism you d be right,academic
but you d also be right to answer climate change,academic
and in fact climate change has killed more people than terrorism has a lot more,academic
it s perhaps understandable that terrorism generates much more attention and concern yet public health responses should be proportionate to actual not perceived threats,academic
climate change is exposing populations to increasing temperatures and extreme weather events in many parts of australia,academic
to prepare for climate challenges there is a growing need for local health districts lhds to identify potential health impacts in their region and strengthen the capacity of the health system to respond accordingly,academic
this rapid review summarised existing evidence and research gaps on the impact of climate change on health and health services in northern new south wales nsw a hotspot for climate disaster declarations,academic
we systematically searched online databases and selected 11 peer reviewed studies published between 2012 2022 for the northern nsw region,academic
the most explored health outcome was mental health in the aftermath of floods and droughts followed by increased healthcare utilisation due to respiratory cardiovascular and mortality outcomes associated with bushfire smoke or heat waves,academic
future research directions were recommended to understand the compounding impacts of extreme events on health and the health system local data needs that can better inform models that predict future health risks and healthcare utilisation for the region and the needs of vulnerable populations that require a whole of system response during the different phases of disasters,academic
in conclusion the review provided climate change and health research directions the lhd may undertake to inform future adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies relevant to their region,academic
the scientific consensus is that global warming is occurring and is largely the result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity,academic
this paper examines the health implications of global warming the current socio political attitudes towards action on climate change and highlight the health co benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions,academic
in addition policy development for climate change and health should embrace health systems strengthening commencing by incorporating climate change targets into millennium development goal 7,academic
in response we respectfully disagree with dr,academic
mondrow s claim that acp s policy paper on climate change and health is an egregious overreach that is outside the college s mission,academic
the acp became involved in analyzing the health effects of climate change and developing our policy paper at the request of our board of governorsleaders of our state and international chapters elected by the membership,academic
the board of governors resolution asked the board of regents to support efforts to educate and respond to the medical consequences of climate change affecting or potentially affecting patients,academic
the board of regents adopted the resolution in november 2014,academic
as requested by the board of governors our health and public policy committeemade up of practicing internistmembersreviewed the evidence on climate change s effect on human health and concluded that it poses an immediate and longer term threat to individual and population health,academic
the committee s draft position paper was reviewed and commented upon by our board of governors acp s councils of student members young physicians residents and subspecialties and independent experts in the science of climate change and its effect on health before being adopted as policy by acp s board of regents,academic
this process involving review of the draft by hundreds of acp members ensured that the full and diverse range of views within our membership was considered,academic
as atmospheric science does not fall within acp s usual purview it relied on the work of trusted objective expertsincluding the national academy of sciences and the royal college the national aeronautics and space administration and the intergovernmental panel on climate changeto reach its conclusion that the warming of climate is definite and that climate change is largely caused by human activity,academic
these organizations do have the expertise to review the relevant data and their consensus on anthropogenic climate change is clear,academic
mondrow s claim that the statement that ninety seven percent of climate scientists agree that humans are largely causing global warming has been discredited is also unfounded,academic
although some proponents of doing nothing to address climate change have questioned the accuracy of cook and colleagues study it was recently bolstered in the peer reviewed scientific journal environmental research letters in which the authors concluded that the consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90 100 of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co authors of this paper and the finding of 97 consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer reviewed studies 1,academic
we believe that the paper on climate change and health objectively describes how climate change has affected is affecting and will continue to affect human health from exacerbating respiratory disease to increasing the risk for heat related illness,academic
climate change is an individual and public health issue,academic
because it affects the patients whom our members treat acp believes that it is imperative that our members work to become educated about climate change and health reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of their own practices and advocate for policies to adapt to and mitigate climate change,academic
berman expresses concern about recommendation 3 of the position paper which states physicians both individually and collectively are encouraged to advocate for climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and communicate about the health cobenefits of addressing climate change in objective simple language to their community and policymakers,academic
he proposes that physicians may lack the expertise to independently analyze climate change research making it difficult to effectively discuss climate change adaptation and mitigation policies with their patients,academic
we clarify that the intent of the recommendation is to call on physicians and other health care professionals both individually and collectively to advocate for action to address climate change to members of their community and policymakers,academic
to assist our members in this charge acp has developed a climate change action plan a toolkit including talking points and presentation slides that can be used for chapter presentations grand rounds and other educational opportunities,academic
because health careand particularly hospitalsis among the most energy intensive commercial sectors the toolkit includes a collection of greening the health care sector documents to help guide physicians and their colleagues to make their practices and facilities more environmentally sustainable by addressing energy management transportation waste and food and the built environment,academic
the toolkit includes a patient facts education document developed by acp s center for patient partnership in healthcare part of the college s patient tested educational series designed to help patients increase their understanding of health issues,academic
we agree with dr,academic
reines that agriculture and food production are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and that reducing meat protein consumption could help mitigate climate change,academic
according to the intergovernmental panel on climate change the agriculture forestry and other land use sector is responsible for approximately 25 of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions 2,academic
under the rationale for position 1 which recommends the development and implementation of strategies to adapt to and mitigate climate change acp s policy paper states the agricultural sector is a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions such as methane from livestock,academic
by reducing demand for greenhouse gasintensive meat in high income countries and shifting to healthier diets rich in legumes fruits and vegetables environmental and health cobenefits could be realized,academic
the aforementioned acp climate change action plan includes a document summarizing how the health care sector can reduce its greenhouse gas footprint by eliminating waste and encouraging consumption of healthy local foods,academic
extreme weather and climate events such as heat waves cyclones and floods are an expression of climate variability,academic
these events and events influenced by climate change such as wildfires continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well being,academic
although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades climate change and more people moving into harm s way could alter this trend,academic
long term changes to earth s energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios,academic
while most of these events cannot be completely avoided many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate resilient health systems with improved risk reduction preparation response and recovery,academic
conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure,academic
the risks are urgent so action is needed now,academic
expected final online publication date for the annual review of public health volume 42 is april 2021,academic

objectives health canada s program for climate change and health adaptation in northern first nation and inuit communities is unique among canadian federal programs in that it enables community based participatory research by northern communities,academic
study design the program was designed to build capacity by funding communities to conduct their own research in cooperation with aboriginal associations academics and governments that way communities could develop health related adaptation plans and communication materials that would help in adaptation decision making at the community regional national and circumpolar levels with respect to human health and a changing environment,academic
methods community visits and workshops were held to familiarize northerners with the impacts of climate change on their health as well as methods to develop research proposals and budgets to meet program requirements,academic
results since the launch of the climate change and health adaptation program in 2008 health canada has funded 36 community projects across canada s north that focus on relevant health issues caused by climate change,academic
in addition the program supported capacity building workshops for northerners as well as a pan arctic results workshop to bring communities together to showcase the results of their research,academic
results include numerous films and photo voice products that engage youth and elders and are available on the web community based ice monitoring surveillance and communication networks and information products on land water and ice safety drinking water food security and safety and traditional medicine,academic
conclusions through these efforts communities have increased their knowledge and understanding of the health effects related to climate change and have begun to develop local adaptation strategies,academic
during every climatic era life on earth is constrained by a limited range of climatic conditions outside which thriving and then surviving becomes difficult,academic
this applies at both planetary and organism species levels,academic
further many causal influences of climate change on human health entail changes often disruptive sometimes irreversible in complex system functioning,academic
understanding the diverse health risks from climate change and their influence pathways presents a challenge to environmental health researchers whose prior work has been in a more definable specific and quantitative milieu,academic
extension of the research agenda and conceptual framework to assess present and future health risks from climate change may be constrained by three factors i lack of historically informed understanding of population health sensitivity to climatic changes ii an instinctual epidemiologising tendency to choose research topics amenable to conventional epidemiological analysis and risk estimation and iii under confidence in relation to interdisciplinary collaborative scenario based modeling of future health risks,academic
these constraints must be recognized and remedied,academic
and environmental researchers must argue for heightened public attention to today s macro environmental threats to present and future population health emphasising the ecological dimension of these determinants of long term health that apply to whole populations and communities not just to individuals and social groupings,academic
there is increasing understanding globally that climate change and increased pollution will have a profound and mostly harmful effect on human health,academic
this review brings together international experts to describe both the direct such as heat waves and indirect such as vector borne disease incidence health impacts of climate change,academic
these impacts vary depending on vulnerability i,academic
existing diseases and the international economic political and environmental context,academic
this unique review also expands on these issues to address a third category of potential longer term impacts on global health famine population dislocation and environmental justice and education,academic
this scholarly resource explores these issues fully linking them to global health in urban and rural settings in developed and developing countries,academic
the review finishes with a practical discussion of action that health professionals around the world in our field can yet take,academic
many consequences of climate change undermine the stability of global food systems decreasing food security and diet quality and exposing vulnerable populations to multiple forms of malnutrition,academic
the emergence of pandemics such as covid 19 exacerbate the situation and make interactions even more complex,academic
climate change impacts food systems at different levels including changes in soil fertility and crop yield composition and bioavailability of nutrients in foods pest resistance and risk of malnutrition,academic
sustainable and resilient food systems coupled with climate smart agriculture are needed to ensure sustainable diets that are adequately diverse nutritious and better aligned with contextual ecosystem functions and environmental conservation,academic
robust tools and indicators are urgently needed to measure the reciprocal food systems climate change interaction that is further complicated by pandemics and how it impacts human health,academic
due to the continuous rise of global temperatures and heatwaves worldwide as a result of climate change concerns for the health and safety of working populations have increased,academic
workers in the food production chain particularly farmworkers are especially vulnerable to heat stress due to the strenuous nature of their work which is performed primarily outdoors under poor working conditions,academic
at the cross section of climate change and farmworkers health a scoping review was undertaken to summarize the existing knowledge regarding the health impacts associated with climate change and heat stress guide future research toward better understanding current and future climate change risks and inform policies to protect the health and safety of agricultural workers,academic
a systematic search of 5 electronic databases and gray literature websites was conducted to identify relevant literature published up until december 2021,academic
a total of 9045 records were retrieved from the searches of which 92 articles were included in the final review,academic
the majority of the reviewed articles focused on heat related illnesses n 57 and kidney diseases n 28,academic
the risk factors identified in the reviewed studies included gender dehydration heat strain wearing inappropriate clothing workload piece rate payment job decision latitude and hot environmental conditions,academic
on the other hand various protective and preventive factors were identified including drinking water changing work hours and schedule of activities wearing appropriate clothing reducing soda consumption taking breaks in shaded or air conditioned areas and increasing electrolyte consumption in addition to improving access to medical care,academic
this review also identified various factors that are unique to vulnerable agricultural populations including migrant and child farmworkers,academic
our findings call for an urgent need to expand future research on vulnerable agricultural communities including migrant workers so as to develop effective policies and interventions that can protect these communities from the effects of heat stress,academic
the study examined the impact of climate change on public health provisioning in sub saharan africa,academic
in addition to recognising the multifarious influence of climate change on health it argues that the quest for global health security can only be achieved against the backdrop of concerted mainstreaming of climate change response into public heath provisioning especially in the developing world,academic
adapting to climate change and mitigating its impact would logically require integrating it into public health planning programming and interventions,academic
therefore if health security entails provisioning and catering to the full range of health needs of people climate change given its undoubted implications for health should be in the forefront of health security globally,academic
despite the global discourse of climate change and health security tangible actions and programmes at different levels are needed to achieve the goals of good health and effective health security,academic
this is no less the case now that the pandemic has challenged and stretched health institutions and provisions,academic
however the complex and intertwining effects of climate change and its manifold nexus with public health and health security can easily be apprehended through the systems perspective,academic
there is the need for both radicalization of the public health system in sub saharan africa and concerted efforts across disciplines and actors to achieve effective climate change mitigation and adaptation and thus further strengthen health security,academic
the role climate change may play in altering human health particularly in the emergence and spread of diseases is an evolving area of research,academic
it is important to understand this relationship because it will compound the already significant burden of diseases on national economies and public health,academic
authorities need to be able to assess anticipate and monitor human health vulnerability to climate change in order to plan for or implement action to avoid these eventualities,academic
environmental health indicators ehis provide a tool to assess monitor and quantify human health vulnerability to aid in the design and targeting of interventions and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities,academic
our aim was to identify the most suitable framework for developing ehis to measure and monitor the impacts of climate change on human health and inform the development of interventions,academic
using published literature we reviewed the attributes of 11 frameworks,academic
we identified the driving force pressure state exposure effect action dpseea framework as the most suitable one for developing ehis for climate change and health,academic
we propose the use of ehis as a valuable tool to assess quantify and monitor human health vulnerability design and target interventions and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities,academic
in this paper we lay the groundwork for the future development of ehis as a multidisciplinary approach to link existing environmental and epidemiological data and networks,academic
analysis of such data will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the relationship between climate change and human health,academic
urban populations are growing rapidly throughout the asia pacific region,academic
cities are vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change because of their concentration of people and infrastructure the physical geographical material and structural attributes of the built environment and the ecological interdependence with the urban ecosystem,academic
australia is one of the most highly urbanized countries in the region and its already variable climate is set to become hotter and drier with climate change,academic
climate change in australia is expected to increase morbidity and mortality from thermal stress bacterial gastroenteritis vector borne disease air pollution flooding and bushfires,academic
the cost and availability of fresh water food and energy will also likely be affected,academic
the more vulnerable urban populations including the elderly socioeconomically disadvantaged groups and those with underlying chronic disease will be most affected,academic
adaptation strategies need to address this underlying burden of disease and inequity as well as implement broad structural changes to building codes and urban design and infrastructure capacity,academic
in doing so cities provide opportunities to realize co benefits for health eg from increased levels of physical activity and improved air quality,academic
with evidence that climate change is underway the need for cities to be a focus in the development of climate adaptation strategies is becoming more urgent,academic
introduction if climate change is the 21st century s biggest public health threat research faces the major challenge of providing adequate evidence for vulnerable communities to adapt to the health effects of climate change,academic
available information about best practice in climate adaptation suggests it is inclusive of socio economic disadvantage and local community factors such as access to health services,academic
since 1995 at least 19 164 papers have been published on climate change in the health sciences and social sciences,academic
this body of literature has not yet been systematically examined for how well it serves rural communities,academic
methods the ultimate aim of the study was to contribute to better understandings about what climate adaptation research has been done and is needed for rural communities,academic
the two research questions were what kinds of content define climate change research in disciplines that could potentially contribute to adaptation for health,academic
and how is content about rural and aboriginal communities and best practice in adaptation related to this content,academic
a quantitative content analysis was performed using computational linguistics leximancer software,academic
the analysis included 19 164 health and social sciences abstracts batched by years from 1 january 1995 to 31 july 2012,academic
the relative frequency and co occurrence of 52 concepts in these abstracts were mapped as well as associations with positive or negative sentiment for selected concepts,academic
results aboriginal concepts tend to be relatively infrequent 3 and 5 overall likelihood of occurrence respectively and are more associated with socio economic concepts in the social sciences than the health sciences,academic
multiple concepts in the health sciences literature are typically connected with disease and ultimately science storylines with a 38 likelihood of paired co occurrence of health and disease concepts alone,academic
the social sciences appear more focused on the local and particular issues of community in climate change than the health sciences,academic
rural and aboriginal concepts have increased by 1 across both discipline areas since 2011 for the rural concept and since 2004 for the aboriginal concept,academic
health concepts in the health sciences and economic concepts in the social sciences as well as urban concepts are referred to more positively than either the rural or aboriginal concepts,academic
conclusions while care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of this study too negatively for rural and aboriginal communities they suggest that a disease focus dominates climate and health research typically unconnected to wider socio economic and human system factors,academic
this finding needs to be considered in light of the accumulating evidence of the importance of such contextual systemic factors in understanding climate and health effects and responses,academic
the study adds some support to the view that a key priority is bringing the learnings of applied community based researchers from those in rural health to those in the social sciences to climate research,academic
there is a need to build confidence including in the rural health sector which has arguably been slow to participate in programs of climate change research that community based research could make a difference to rural health in a climate changing world,academic
background assessing research activity is important for planning future protective and adaptive policies,academic
the objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases,academic
method a bibliometric method was applied using sciverse scopus,academic
documents on climate change and human health were called health related literature while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called infection related literature,academic
the study period was from 1980 to 2019,academic
results the search query found 4247 documents in the health related literature and 1207 in the infection related literature,academic
the growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007,academic
there were four research themes in the health related literature 1 climate change and infectious diseases 2 climate change public health and food security 3 heat waves mortality and non communicable diseases and 4 climate change air pollution allergy and respiratory health,academic
the most frequently encountered pathogens infectious diseases in the infection related literature were malaria and dengue,academic
documents in infection related literature had a higher h index than documents in the health related literature,academic
the top cited documents in the health related literature focused on food security public health and infectious diseases while those in infection related literature focused on water vector and mosquito borne diseases,academic
the european region had the highest contribution in health related literature n 1626 38,academic
3 and infection related literature n 497 41,academic
the usa led with 1235 29,academic
1 documents in health related literature and 365 30,academic
2 documents in infection related literature,academic
the australian national university ranked first in the health related literature while the london school of hygiene tropical medicine ranked first in the infection related literature,academic
international research collaboration was inadequate,academic
documents published in the environmental health perspectives journal received the highest citations per document,academic
a total of 1416 33,academic
3 documents in the health related literature were funded while 419 34,academic
7 documents in the infection related literature were funded,academic
conclusion research on climate change and human health is on the rise with research on infection related issues making a good share,academic
international research collaboration should be funded and supported,academic
future research needs to focus on the impact of climate change on psychosocial mental innovations policies and preparedness of health systems,academic
climate change and associated changing weather patterns including severe weather events are expected to increase the prevalence of a wide range of health risks,academic
yet there is uncertainty about the timing location and severity of these changes,academic
adaptive management a structured process of decision making in the face of imperfect information is an approach that can help the public health field effectively anticipate plan for and respond to the health risks of climate change,academic
in this article i describe adaptive management and how it could increase the effectiveness of local and national strategies policies and programs to manage climate sensitive health outcomes,academic
abstract the world health organization has concluded that the climatic changes that have occurred since the mid 1970s could already be causing annually over 150 000 deaths and five million disability adjusted life years daly mainly in developing countries,academic
the less developed countries are ironically those least responsible for causing global warming,academic
many health outcomes and diseases are sensitive to climate including heat related mortality or morbidity air pollution related illnesses infectious diseases particularly those transmitted indirectly via water or by insect or rodent vectors and refugee health issues linked to forced population migration,academic
yet changing landscapes can significantly affect local weather more acutely than long term climate change,academic
land cover change can influence micro climatic conditions including temperature evapo transpiration and surface run off that are key determinants in the emergence of many infectious diseases,academic
to improve risk assessment and risk management of these synergistic processes climate and land use change more collaborative efforts in research training and policy decision support across the fields of health environment sociology and economics are required,academic
wildfires global climate change and human health wildfires are increasingly common and projected to worsen with climate change,academic
health consequences include burns and mental health effects as wel,academic
climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations,academic
this scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the world health organisation s who five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change,academic
we conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases,academic
we assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available,academic
we identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020,academic
most studies were quantitative n 67 cross sectional n 42 conducted in high income countries n 87 and concerned with the first of the who global research priorities assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change n 101,academic
several climate related exposures including heat humidity rainfall drought wildfires and floods were associated with psychological distress worsened mental health and higher mortality among people with pre existing mental health conditions increased psychiatric hospitalisations and heightened suicide rates,academic
few studies n 19 addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change effective interventions n 8 mitigation and adaptation n 7 improving decision support n 3 and cost estimations n 1,academic
while climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence based mitigation and adaptation strategies,academic
backgroundfor almost 20 years the intergovernmental panel on climate change has been assessing the potential health risks associated with climate change with increasingly convincing evidence that climate change presents existing impacts on human health,academic
in industrialized countries climate change may further affect public health and in particular respiratory health through existing health stressors including anticipated increased number of deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves increased frequency of cardiopulmonary events due to higher concentrations of air pollutants and altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens and some infectious disease vectors,academic
additionally exposure to moulds and contaminants from water damaged buildings may increase,academic
methodswe undertook an expert elicitation amongst european researchers engaged in environmental medicine or respiratory health,academic
all experts were actively publishing researchers on lung disease and air pollution climate and health or a closely related research,academic
we conducted an online questionnaire on proposed causal diagrams and determined levels of confidence that climate change will have an impact on a series of stressors,academic
in a workshop following the online questionnaire half of the experts further discussed the results and reasons for differences in assessments of the state of knowledge on exposures and health effects,academic
resultsout of 16 experts 100 expressed high to very high confidence that climate change would increase the frequency of heat waves,academic
at least half expressed high or very high confidence that climate change would increase levels of pollen 50 particulate matter pm2,academic
5 55 and ozone 70,academic
while clarity is needed around the impacts of increased exposures to health impacts of some stressors including ozone and particulate matter levels it was noted that definitive knowledge is not a prerequisite for policy action,academic
information to the public preventive measures monitoring and warning systems were among the most commonly mentioned preventative actions,academic
conclusionsthis group of experts identifies clear health risks associated with climate change and express opinions about these risks even while they do not necessarily regard themselves as covering all areas of expertise,academic
since some changes in exposure have already been observed the consensus is that there is already a scientific basis for preventative action and that the associated adaptation and mitigation policies should also be evidence based,academic
global climate change is progressing and health impacts have been observed in a number of countries including australia,academic
the main health impacts will be due to direct heat exposure extreme weather air pollution reduced local food production food and vectorborne infectious diseases and mental stress,academic
the issue is one of major public health importance,academic
adaptation to reduce the effects of climate change involves many different sectors to minimise negative health outcomes,academic
wide scale mitigation is also required in order to reduce the effects of climate change,academic
in addition future urban design must be modified to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change,academic
strategies for mitigation and adaptation can create co benefits for both individual and community health by reducing non climate related health hazard exposures and by encouraging health promoting behaviours and lifestyles,academic
this article provides examples of adverse health effects including weather related injury food insecurity mental health issues and water infrastructure damage and the responses to these effects that are currently being applied in two northwest alaska communities,academic
background in northwest alaska warming is resulting in a broad range of unusual weather and environmental conditions including delayed freeze up earlier breakup storm surge coastal erosion and thawing permafrost,academic
these are just some of the climate impacts that are driving concerns about weather related injury the spread of disease mental health issues infrastructure damage and food and water security,academic
local leaders are challenged to identify appropriate adaptation strategies to address climate impacts and related health effects,academic
implementation process the tribal health system is combining local observations traditional knowledge and western science to perform community specific climate change health impact assessments,academic
local leaders are applying this information to develop adaptation responses,academic
objective the alaska native tribal health consortium will describe relationships between climate impacts and health effects and provide examples of community scaled adaptation actions currently being applied in northwest alaska,academic
findings climate change is increasing vulnerability to injury disease mental stress food insecurity and water insecurity,academic
northwest communities are applying adaptation approaches that are both specific and appropriate,academic
conclusion the health impact assessment process is effective in raising awareness encouraging discussion engaging partners and implementing adaptation planning,academic
with community specific information local leaders are applying health protective adaptation measures,academic
climate change and air pollution have been a matter of serious concern all over the world in the last few decades,academic
the present review has been carried out in this concern over the indian cities with significant impacts of both the climate change and air pollution on human health,academic
the expanding urban areas with extreme climate events high rainfall extreme temperature floods and droughts are posing human health risks,academic
the intensified heat waves as a result of climate change have led to the elevation in temperature levels causing thermal discomfort and several health issues to urban residents,academic
the study also covers the increasing air pollution levels above the prescribed standards for most of the indian megacities,academic
the aerosols and pm concentrations have been explored and hazardous health impacts of particles that are inhaled by humans and enter the respiratory system have also been discussed,academic
the air quality during covid 2019 lockdown in indian cities with its health impacts has also been reviewed,academic
finally the correlation between climate change air pollution and urbanizations has been presented as air pollutants such as aerosols affect the climate of earth both directly by absorption and scattering and indirectly by altering the cloud properties and radiation transfer processes,academic
so the present review will serve as a baseline data for policy makers in analyzing vulnerable regions and implementing mitigation plans for tackling air pollution,academic
the adaptation and mitigation measures can be taken based on the review in indian cities to reciprocate human health impacts by regular air pollution monitoring and addressing climate change as well,academic
this special report discusses the importance of climate change for health care and radiology,academic
the impact of climate change on human health and health equity the contribution of health care and medical imaging to the climate crisis and the impetus for change within radiology to create a more sustainable future are covered,academic
the authors focus on actions and opportunities to address climate change in our role as radiologists,academic
a toolkit highlights actions we can take toward a more sustainable future linking each action with the expected impact and outcome,academic
this toolkit includes a hierarchy of actions from first steps to advocating for system level change,academic
this includes actions we can take in our daily lives in radiology departments and professional organizations and in our relationships with vendors and industry partners,academic
as radiologists we are adept at managing rapid technological change which makes us ideally suited to lead these initiatives,academic
alignment of incentives and synergies with health systems are highlighted given that many of the proposed strategies also result in cost savings,academic
backgroundthis article provides an overview of the current and projected climate change risks and impacts to mental health and provides recommendations for priority actions to address the mental health consequences of climate change,academic
discussion and conclusionthe authors argue the following three points firstly while attribution of mental health outcomes to specific climate change risks remains challenging there are a number of opportunities available to advance the field of mental health and climate change with more empirical research in this domain secondly the risks and impacts of climate change on mental health are already rapidly accelerating resulting in a number of direct indirect and overarching effects that disproportionally affect those who are most marginalized and thirdly interventions to address climate change and mental health need to be coordinated and rooted in active hope in order to tackle the problem in a holistic manner,academic
this discussion paper concludes with recommendations for priority actions to address the mental health consequences of climate change,academic
overwhelming evidence shows that climate change presents growing threats to public health security from extreme weather related disasters to wider spread of such vector borne diseases as malaria and dengue,academic
the impacts of climate on human health will not be evenly distributed around the world,academic
the third assessment report intergovernmental panel on climate change 2001 concluded that vulnerability to climate change is a function of exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity,academic
developing country populations particularly in small island states arid and high mountain zones and in densely populated coastal areas are considered to be particularly vulnerable,academic
india is a large developing country with the great himalayas the world s third largest ice mass in the north 7500 km long and densely populated coast line in the south,academic
nearly 700 million of her over one billion population living in rural areas directly depends on climate sensitive sectors agriculture forests and fisheries and natural resources such as water biodiversity mangroves coastal zones grasslands for their subsistence and livelihoods,academic
heat wave floods land and coastal and draughts occur commonly,academic
malaria malnutrition and diarrhea are major public health problems,academic
any further increase as projected in weather related disasters and related health effects may cripple the already inadequate public health infrastructure in the country,academic
hence there is an urgent need to respond to the situation,academic
response options to protect health from effects of climate change include mitigation as well as adaptation,academic
both can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change,academic
climate change which encompasses the longterm changes in temperature and weather patterns seen since the industrial revolution attributed in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases is increasingly recognized for its farreaching consequences on human health,academic
1 the consequences of fossil fuel combustion that range from air pollution to extreme heat and to severe weather patterns can translate both directly and indirectly to increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality,academic
2 the exposure pathways that link climate change to health outcomes vary based on both geographic context eg people living in floodprone areas face different challenges from those living in droughtprone areas and sociodemographic context eg people with limited economic resources may be particularly vulnerable to health impacts of a changing climate for which they lack the resources to overcome the effects,academic
accordingly better understanding of the effects of climate change is of increasing importance for clinicians to empower them to develop strategies to reduce its burden on the health of their patients,academic
this article will identify climatesensitive environmental stressors discuss their effects on cardiovascular health and review the unique risks faced by vulnerable communities cared for by cardiovascular disease specialists,academic
background the worsening climate change and alarming prevalence of communicable and non communicable diseases continue to threat human life and existence,academic
accumulating evidence suggests that favorable patterns of 24 h movement behaviors high physical activity low sedentary behavior and adequate sleep may positively contribute to achieving dual benefits of climate change mitigation and disease prevention,academic
the purposes of this mini umbrella review were to summarize the most up to date high level evidence exploring the relationships between climate change 24 h movement behaviors and health and elaborate on the mechanisms linking the three variables of interest,academic
methods a systematic search of electronic databases was performed in pubmed and google scholar during march october 2020,academic
inclusion criteria were 1 systematic review 2 reviewed relationships between climate change and movement behaviors and or health in any directions 3 written in english 4 published in 2010 2020,academic
narrative synthesis was conducted to highlight the main relationships observed and address the current state of knowledge and priorities for future research,academic
in order to illustrate the potential mechanisms between climate change movement behaviors and health the main results from included systematic reviews were summarized and a conceptual framework was developed for future research,academic
results based on the evidence from eight systematic reviews published in the past decade multi directional i,academic
uni bi or u shaped links were observed between climate change and varying human health outcomes,academic
however little is understood about the association between climate change and 24 h movement behaviors,academic
two reviews suggested the negative impact of climate change on sleep and bi directional relationships between climate change and physical activity sport,academic
one review included two studies suggesting the unfavorable impact of climate change on sedentary behavior however the evidence was limited,academic
finally no reviews examined the mechanisms by which climate change movement behaviors and health impact one another,academic
based on the findings of this mini umbrella review a conceptual framework is proposed that could guide future work to unpack mechanisms between climate change movement behaviors and health,academic
conclusions this mini umbrella review highlights the importance of better understanding the mechanisms between climate change movement behaviors and health in developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change while paying close attention to vulnerable countries communities population groups,academic
current data and scientific predictions about the consequences of climate change are accurate in suggesting disaster,academic
since 2019 climate change has become a threat to human health and major consequences on health and health systems are already observed,academic
climate change is a central concern for the nursing discipline even though nursing theorists understanding of the environment has led to problematic gaps that impact the current context,academic
today nursing discipline is facing new challenges,academic
nurses are strategically placed to respond to the impacts of climate change through their practice research and training in developing implementing and sustaining innovation towards climate change mitigation and adaptation,academic
it is urgent for them to adapt their practice to this reality to become agents of change,academic
climate change is a major global public health challenge that will have wide ranging impacts on human psychological health and well being,academic
children and adolescents are at particular risk because of their rapidly developing brain vulnerability to disease and limited capacity to avoid or adapt to threats and impacts,academic
they are also more likely to worry about climate change than any other age group,academic
drawing on a developmental life course perspective we show that climate change related threats can additively interactively and cumulatively increase psychopathology risk from conception onward that these effects are already occurring and that they constitute an important threat to healthy human development worldwide,academic
we then argue that monitoring measuring and mitigating these risks is a matter of social justice and a crucial long term investment in developmental and mental health sciences,academic
we conclude with a discussion of conceptual and measurement challenges and outline research priorities going forward,academic
household energy is increasingly vital for maintaining good health,academic
unaffordable and inadequate household energy presents adverse consequences that are amplified by poverty and a changing climate,academic
to date the connections between energy socioeconomic disadvantage and well being are generally underappreciated and household energy connection with climate change is under researched,academic
building on the energy insecurity framework this review explores literature related to household energy poverty and health in order to highlight the disproportionate burdens borne by vulnerable populations in adequately meeting household energy needs,academic
this paper is based on a comprehensive review of books peer reviewed articles and reports published between 1990 and 2019 identified via databases including jstor and pubmed,academic
a total of 406 publications were selected as having potential for full review 203 received full review and 162 were included in this paper on the basis of set inclusion criteria,academic
from the literature review we created an original heuristic model that describes energy insecurity as either acute or chronic and we further explore the mediators and pathways that link energy insecurity to health,academic
in the discussion we posit that the extant literature does not sufficiently consider that vulnerable communities often experience energy insecurity bundled with other hardships,academic
we also discuss energy poverty and health through the lens of climate change making the criticism that most research on household energy does not consider climate change,academic
this evidence is important for enhancing research in this field and developing programmatic and policy interventions as they pertain to energy access affordability and health with special emphasis on vulnerable populations climate change and social inequality,academic
objective to increase the knowledge and communication skills of health professionals related to climate change and human health cchh,academic
methods from february to april 2021 project echo extension for community healthcare outcomes created an 8 week synchronous and virtual cchh echo telementoring series for health professionals,academic
didactics simulated cases and climate change tools were used to educate the interprofessional group of participants,academic
results during this cchh echo pilot series 625 unique participants represented 45 us states and 25 countries,academic
the participants reported that they increased their knowledge skills and communication techniques regarding climate change and health,academic
conclusions the human health effects of climate change is an emerging field and increasing knowledge and communication skills among health practitioners is of critical importance,academic
the cchh echo is one potential platform that may reach a diverse community of health professionals globally due to the diffusion and demonopolization of knowledge,academic
climate change poses numerous threats to human life including physical and mental health the environment housing food security and economic growth,academic
people who already experience multidimensional poverty with the disparity in social political economic historical and environmental contexts are more vulnerable to these impacts,academic
the study aims to identify the role of climate change in increasing multidimensional inequalities among vulnerable populations and analyze the strengths and limitations of south africa s national climate change adaptation strategy,academic
a systematic review was applied and literature from google google scholar and pubmed as well as relevant gray literature from 2014 2022 were reviewed,academic
out of 854 identified sources 24 were included in the review,academic
climate change has exacerbated multidimensional inequalities among vulnerable populations in south africa,academic
though the national climate change adaptation strategy has paid attention to health issues and the needs of vulnerable groups the adaptation measures appear to focus less on mental and occupational health,academic
climate change may play a significant role in increasing multidimensional inequalities and exacerbating health consequences among vulnerable populations,academic
for an inclusive and sustainable reduction in inequalities and vulnerabilities to the impact of climate change community based health and social services should be enhanced among vulnerable populations,academic
this is a case study describing how climate change may affect the health of british columbians and to suggest a way forward to promote health and policy research and adaptation to these changes,academic
after reviewing the limited evidence of the impacts of climate change on human health we have developed five principles to guide the development of research and policy to better predict future impacts of climate change on health and to enhance adaptation to these change in bc,academic
we suggest that with some modification these principles will be useful to policy makers in other jurisdictions,academic
human health is increasingly threatened by rapid and widespread changes in the environment and climate including rising temperatures air and water pollution disease vector migration floods and droughts,academic
in the united states many medical schools the american medical association and the national academy of sciences have published calls for physicians and physicians in training to develop a basic knowledge of the science of climate change and an awareness of the associated health risks,academic
the authors all medical students and educators argue for the expeditious redesign of medical school curricula to teach students to recognize diagnose and treat the many health conditions exacerbated by climate change as well as understanding public health issues,academic
in this invited commentary the authors briefly review the health impacts of climate change examine current climate change course offerings and proposals and describe the rationale for promptly and comprehensively including climate science education in medical school curricula,academic
efforts in training physicians now will benefit those physicians communities whose health will be impacted by a period of remarkable climate change,academic
the bottom line is that the health effects of climate reality cannot be ignored and people everywhere must adapt as quickly as possible,academic
climate change may affect human health through multiple and interactive pathways that include safe water scarcity,academic
however impacts of climate change induced water scarcity on health and well being are complex,academic
about 80 of illnesses in developing countries are attributed to unsafe drinking water and waterborne diseases,academic
in southwestern bangladesh lack of safe drinking water is a severe crisis due to climate change,academic
the study investigated the impacts of climate change on water resources and human health in a coastal area,academic
a questionnaire survey was carried out in two villages of shymnagar upazila on the southwestern coast to investigate the present status of safe water sources and health care facilities and their impacts on the local community,academic
the results show that the local community believes that climate change is having substantial impacts on freshwater sources and health,academic
more than 70 of the respondents identified diarrhea dysentery and skin diseases as the prime waterborne health risks that occur through climate related safe water scarcity,academic
by synthesizing the ground data we suggest pathways to health adaptation to climate change effects and safe water scarcity through locally available adaptive practices such as the use of pond sand filters rainwater harvesting and importing potable water with the active participation of the government nongovernmental organizations and communities,academic
there is growing evidence on the observed and expected consequences of climate change on population health worldwide,academic
there is limited understanding of its consequences for child health inequalities between and within countries,academic
to examine these consequences and categorize the state of knowledge in this area we conducted a review of reviews indexed in five databases medline embase web of science psycinfo sociological abstracts,academic
reviews that reported the effect of climate change on child health inequalities between low and high income children within or between countries high vs low middle income countries hics and lmics were included,academic
twenty three reviews published between 2007 and january 2021 were included for full text analyses,academic
using thematic synthesis we identified strong descriptive but limited quantitative evidence that climate change exacerbates child health inequalities,academic
explanatory mechanisms relating climate change to child health inequalities were proposed in some reviews for example children in lmics are more susceptible to the consequences of climate change than children in hics due to limited structural and economic resources,academic
geographic and intergenerational inequalities emerged as additional themes from the review,academic
further research with an equity focus should address the effects of climate change on adolescents youth mental health and inequalities within countries,academic
climate change represents one of the most significant health challenges and global inequities of our generation,academic
as a wicked problem climate change imposes an involuntary exposure on vulnerable individuals and societies that is regressive in its nature with those least responsible for destroying planetary health at greatest risk of suffering the direct and indirect health consequences of unabated warming of the planet,academic
the current and future generations of children are the most vulnerable population to suffer the effects of climate change,academic
by 2030 there will be 131 000 additional child deaths each year if climate mitigation strategies are not enacted driven by the synergy of an increasing burden of infectious diseases food insecurity and political instability,academic
over half a billion of the world s children live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather events and there is a pressing risk that our current lack of action to mitigate and adapt to climate change will result in today s children and future generations being the first to have poorer physical and mental health than previous generations creating a significant intergenerational ethical dilemma,academic
child health care professionals need to advocate for policies to address climate change that consider the complex health planetary and ethical considerations necessary to solve the most significant risk to our children s health today,academic
without immediate action the health of the current and future generations of children is perilous,academic
recent observations of elevated tree mortality following climate extremes like heat and drought raise concerns about climate change risks to global forest health,academic
we currently lack both sufficient data and understanding to identify whether these observations represent a global trend toward increasing tree mortality,academic
here we document events of sudden and unexpected elevated tree mortality following heat and drought events in ecosystems that previously were considered tolerant or not at risk of exposure,academic
these events underscore the fact that climate change may affect forests with unexpected force in the future,academic
we use the events as examples to highlight current difficulties and challenges for realistically predicting such tree mortality events and the uncertainties about future forest condition,academic
advances in remote sensing technology and greater availably of high resolution data from both field assessments and from satellites are needed to improve both understanding and prediction of forest responses to future climate change,academic
expected final online publication date for the annual review of plant biology volume 73 is may 2022,academic
please see http www,academic
org page journal pubdates for revised estimates,academic
the impact of climate change on human health is a topic of critical importance,academic
while only recently beginning to gain attention it is clear that immediate action is necessary to minimize this impact,academic
in our review we will outline a subset of these effects in detail,academic
we will examine how climate change has worsened respiratory allergic disease,academic
we will discuss how climate change has altered antigen exposure possibly disrupting antigen specific tolerance by the immune system leading in turn to an increase in the prevalence of immunologic diseases,academic
finally we will explore how the loss of biodiversity related to climate change may affect the microbiome potentially leading to dysbiosis inflammatory autoimmune and neurologic diseases,academic
through a systematic search of english language peer reviewed studies we assess how health professionals and the public worldwide perceive the health implications of climate change,academic
among health professionals perception that climate change is harming health appears to be high although self assessed knowledge is low and perceived need to learn more is high,academic
among the public few north americans can list any health impacts of climate change or who is at risk but appear to view climate change as harmful to health,academic
among vulnerable publics in asia and africa awareness of increasing health harms due to specific changing climatic conditions is high,academic
americans across the political and climate change opinion spectra appear receptive to information about the health aspects of climate change although findings are mixed,academic
health professionals feel the need to learn more and the public appears open to learning more about the health consequences of climate change,academic
climate change poses a serious threat to the health and well being of indigenous peoples around the world,academic
despite living in diverse contexts indigenous peoples face a number of common challenges,academic
disproportionate threats from climate change exist due to a range of factors including unique relationships with the natural environment socioeconomic deprivation a greater existing burden of disease poorer access to and quality of health care and political marginalization,academic
responses to climate change at global national and local levels also threaten indigenous people s rights,academic
while climate action presents many opportunities to improve health and reduce inequities there is also significant potential for climate mitigation and adaptation policies to inflict harm on indigenous peoples,academic
an important aspect of this is the impact on traditional lands which are acknowledged as a fundamental determinant of indigenous health and well being,academic
this article seeks to elucidate the relationships between climate change and indigenous health and to inform health promotion solutions to achieve climate justice for indigenous peoples,academic
the underpinning analysis is founded on a kaupapa māori positioning which seeks transformative change and involves critiquing western knowledges and structures that undermine indigenous rights,academic
a central theme is that anthropogenic climate change is intimately connected to the ideologies systems and practices of colonialism and that the impacts on indigenous peoples can be conceptualized as an intensification of the process of colonization,academic
it is not possible to understand and address climate related health impacts for indigenous peoples without examining this broader context of colonial oppression marginalization and dispossession,academic
the challenge for health promotion is to engage in a process of decolonization,academic
this involves deconstructing its own systems and practices to avoid reinforcing colonialism and perpetuating inequities,academic
it also requires health promotion practitioners to support indigenous self determination and recognize indigenous knowledges as a critical foundation for climate change and health solutions,academic
globally antimicrobial resistance amr and climate change cc are two of the top health emergencies and can be considered as two interlinked public health priorities,academic
the complex commonalities between amr and cc should be deeply investigated in a one health perspective,academic
here we provided an overview of the current knowledge about the relationship between amr and cc,academic
overall the studies included pointed out the need for applying a systemic approach to planetary health,academic
firstly cc increasingly brings humans and animals into contact leading to outbreaks of zoonotic and vector borne diseases with pandemic potential,academic
although it is well established that antimicrobial use in human animal and environmental sectors is one of the main drivers of amr the covid 19 pandemic is exacerbating the current scenario by influencing the use of antibiotics personal protective equipment and biocides,academic
this also results in higher concentrations of contaminants e,academic
microplastics in natural water bodies which cannot be completely removed from wastewater treatment plants and which could sustain the amr spread,academic
our overview underlined the lack of studies on the direct relationship between amr and cc and encouraged further research to investigate the multiple aspects involved and its effect on human health,academic
background in the past decades climate change has been impacting human lives and health via extreme weather and climate events and alterations in labour capacity food security and the prevalence and geographical distribution of infectious diseases across the globe,academic
climate change and health indicators cchis are workable tools designed to capture the complex set of interdependent interactions through which climate change is affecting human health,academic
since 2015 a novel sub set of cchis focusing on climate change impacts exposures and vulnerability indicators ccievis has been developed refined and integrated by working group 1 of the lancet countdown tracking progress on health and climate change an international collaboration across disciplines that include climate geography epidemiology occupation health and economics,academic
discussion this research in practice article is a reflective narrative documenting how we have developed ccievis as a discrete set of quantifiable indicators that are updated annually to provide the most recent picture of climate change s impacts on human health,academic
in our experience the main challenge was to define globally relevant indicators that also have local relevance and as such can support decision making across multiple spatial scales,academic
we found a hazard exposure and vulnerability framework to be effective in this regard,academic
we here describe how we used such a framework to define ccievis based on both data availability and the indicators relevance to climate change and human health,academic
we also report on how ccievis have been improved and added to detailing the underlying data and methods and in doing so provide the defining quality criteria for lancet countdown ccievis,academic
conclusions our experience shows that ccievis can effectively contribute to a world wide monitoring system that aims to track communicate and harness evidence on climate induced health impacts towards effective intervention strategies,academic
an ongoing challenge is how to improve ccievis so that the description of the linkages between climate change and human health can become more and more comprehensive,academic
purpose of review 1 to develop a framework for understanding the holistic effects of climate change on the saami people 2 to summarize the scientific evidence about the primary secondary and tertiary effects of climate change on saami culture and sápmi region and 3 to identify gaps in the knowledge of the effects of climate change on health and well being of the saami,academic
recent findingsthe saami health is on average similar or slightly better compared to the health of other populations in the same area,academic
warming climate has already influenced saami reindeer culture,academic
mental health and suicide risk partly linked to changing physical and social environments are major concerns,academic
summarythe lifestyle diet and morbidity of the saami are changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for the health of the saami and making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change,academic
climate change is a threat for the cultural way of life of saami,academic
possibilities for saami to adapt to climate change are limited,academic
objectives we aimed to develop a systematic synthesis of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change by synthesising studies characteristics climate impacts health outcomes and key findings,academic
design we conducted an overview of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change,academic
we registered our review in prospero crd42019145972,academic
no ethical approval was required since we used secondary data,academic
additional data are not available,academic
data sources on 22 june 2019 we searched medline cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature cinahl embase cochrane and web of science,academic
eligibility criteria we included systematic reviews that explored at least one health impact of climate change,academic
data extraction and synthesis we organised systematic reviews according to their key characteristics including geographical regions year of publication and authors affiliations,academic
we mapped the climate effects and health outcomes being studied and synthesised major findings,academic
we used a modified version of a measurement tool to assess systematic reviews 2 amstar 2 to assess the quality of studies,academic
results we included 94 systematic reviews,academic
most were published after 2015 and approximately one fifth contained meta analyses,academic
reviews synthesised evidence about five categories of climate impacts the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events,academic
reviews covered 10 health outcome categories the 3 most common were 1 infectious diseases 2 mortality and 3 respiratory cardiovascular or neurological outcomes,academic
most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes although the majority also called for more research,academic
conclusions most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health,academic
this study provides a comprehensive higher order summary of research on health impacts of climate change,academic
study limitations include possible missed relevant reviews no meta meta analyses and no assessment of overlap,academic
future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include broader sociopsychological health impacts of climate change,academic
background climate change is one of the great challenges of our time,academic
the consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects as well as on vulnerable societies are a concern for the entire scientific community,academic
rising temperatures heat waves floods tornadoes hurricanes droughts fires loss of forest and glaciers along with disappearance of rivers and desertification can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental,academic
however there is a clear lack in psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change,academic
methods literature available on pubmed embase and cochrane library until end of june 2019 were reviewed,academic
the total number of articles and association reports was 445,academic
from these 163 were selected,academic
we looked for the association between classical psychiatric disorders such as anxiety schizophrenia mood disorder and depression suicide aggressive behaviors despair for the loss of usual landscape and phenomena related to climate change and extreme weather,academic
review of literature was then divided into specific areas the course of change in mental health temperature water air pollution drought as well as the exposure of certain groups and critical psychological adaptations,academic
results climate change has an impact on a large part of the population in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health,academic
however the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect,academic
lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue,academic
it has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing,academic
the phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions,academic
moreover climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions as well as a lack of access to resources information and protection,academic
perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms coined only recently ecoanxiety ecoguilt ecopsychology ecological grief solastalgia biospheric concern etc,academic
conclusions the effects of climate change can be direct or indirect short term or long term,academic
acute events can act through mechanisms similar to that of traumatic stress leading to well understood psychopathological patterns,academic
in addition the consequences of exposure to extreme or prolonged weather related events can also be delayed encompassing disorders such as posttraumatic stress or even transmitted to later generations,academic
in a policy forum cecilia sorensen and colleagues discuss the implications of climate change for women s health,academic
a growing body of research has documented the phenomenon of climate change anxiety cca defined broadly as negative cognitive emotional and behavioral responses associated with concerns about climate change,academic
a recently validated scale of cca indicated two subscales cognitive emotional impairment and functional impairment clayton karazsia 2020,academic
however there are few empirical studies on cca to date and little evidence regarding whether cca is associated with psychiatric symptoms including symptoms of major depressive disorder mdd and generalized anxiety disorder gad and whether engaging in individual and collective action to address climate change could buffer such relationships,academic
this mixed methods study draws on data collected from a sample of emerging adult students ages 18 35 in the united states n 284 to address these gaps,academic
results indicated that both cca subscales were significantly associated with gad symptoms while only the functional impairment subscale was associated with higher mdd symptoms,academic
moreover engaging in collective action but not individual action significantly attenuated the association between cca cognitive emotional impairment and mdd symptoms,academic
responses to open ended questions asking about participants worries and actions related to climate change indicated the severity of their worries and for some a perception of the insignificance of their actions relative to the enormity of climate change,academic
these results further the field s understanding of cca both in general and specifically among emerging adults and suggest the importance of creating opportunities for collective action to build sense of agency in addressing climate change,academic
climate change is causing warming over most parts of the usa and more extreme weather events,academic
the health impacts of these changes are not experienced equally,academic
we synthesize the recent evidence that climatic changes linked to global warming are having a disparate impact on the health of people of color including children,academic
multiple studies of heat extreme cold hurricanes flooding and wildfires find evidence that people of color including black latinx native american pacific islander and asian communities are at higher risk of climate related health impacts than whites although this is not always the case,academic
studies of adults have found evidence of racial disparities related to climatic changes with respect to mortality respiratory and cardiovascular disease mental health and heat related illness,academic
children are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change and infants and children of color have experienced adverse perinatal outcomes occupational heat stress and increases in emergency department visits associated with extreme weather,academic
the evidence strongly suggests climate change is an environmental injustice that is likely to exacerbate existing racial disparities across a broad range of health outcomes,academic
climate change is acknowledged to be a major risk to public health,academic
skills and competencies related to climate change are becoming a part of the curriculum at schools of public health and are now a competency required by schools in europe and australia,academic
however it is unclear whether graduates of public health programs focusing on climate change are in demand in the current job market,academic
the authors analyzed current job postings 16 years worth of job postings on a public health job board and survey responses from prospective employers,academic
the current job market appears small but there is evidence from job postings that it may be growing and 91,academic
7 of survey respondents believe the need for public health professionals with training in climate change may grow in the next 5 10 years,academic
current employers value skills competencies such as the knowledge of climate mitigation adaptation climate health justice direct indirect and downstream effects of climate on health health impact assessment risk assessment pollution health consequences and causes geographic information system gis mapping communication writing finance economics policy analysis systems thinking and interdisciplinary understanding,academic
ensuring that competencies align with current and future needs is a key aspect of curriculum development,academic
at the same time we recognize that while we attempt to predict future workforce needs with historical data or surveys the disruptive reality created by climate change cannot be modeled from prior trends and we must therefore adopt new paradigms of education for the emerging future,academic
it is now widely acknowledged that low and middle income countries in africa are among global hotspots for high vulnerability to climate change despite making comparatively low contributions to this phenomenon,academic
climate change has been shown to affect mental health as a result of disruption of social and economic structures that populations depend on for good health including mental health,academic
after decades of neglect recent efforts by governments such as in kenya to address the twin issues of climate change and mental health demonstrate the growing importance of these issues,academic
here we briefly review the evidence of climate change impacts on mental health in africa and demonstrate that there is need for more contextual awareness and research in this area in africa to mitigate or forestall potential mental health crises in the near future,academic
we recommend systematic efforts to support funding for research and interventions at the nexus between climate change and mental health in africa and urge institutions and governments in africa to begin paying attention to this emerging threat to the health of african populations,academic
abstract the journal the lancet recently published a countdown on health and climate change,academic
attention was focused solely on humans,academic
however animals including wildlife livestock and pets may also be impacted by climate change,academic
complementary to the high relevance of awareness rising for protecting humans against climate change here we present a one health approach which aims at the simultaneous protection of humans animals and the environment from climate change impacts climate change adaptation,academic
we postulate that integrated approaches save human and animal lives and reduce costs when compared to public and animal health sectors working separately,academic
a one health approach to climate change adaptation may significantly contribute to food security with emphasis on animal source foods extensive livestock systems particularly ruminant livestock environmental sanitation and steps towards regional and global integrated syndromic surveillance and response systems,academic
the cost of outbreaks of emerging vector borne zoonotic pathogens may be much lower if they are detected early in the vector or in livestock rather than later in humans,academic
therefore integrated community based surveillance of zoonoses is a promising avenue to reduce health effects of climate change,academic
an editorial is presented which addresses the authors views about public health and climate change in relation to various natural disasters such as hurricanes harvey irma and maria and it mentions several other articles which appear in the same issue of the journal and deal with topics such as the causal contributions of severe and extreme weather events to climate change and various health consequences,academic
storm severity vector borne diseases and water borne infections are assessed,academic
purpose of reviewair pollution significantly affects health causing up to 7 million premature deaths annually with an even larger number of hospitalizations and days of sick leave,academic
climate change could alter the dispersion of primary pollutants particularly particulate matter and intensify the formation of secondary pollutants such as near surface ozone,academic
the purpose of the review is to evaluate the recent evidence on the impacts of climate change on air pollution and air pollution related health impacts and identify knowledge gaps for future research,academic
recent findingsseveral studies modelled future ozone and particulate matter concentrations and calculated the resulting health impacts under different climate scenarios,academic
due to climate change ozone and fine particle related mortalities are expected to increase in most studies however results differ by region assumed climate change scenario and other factors such as population and background emissions,academic
summarythis review explores the relationships between climate change air pollution and air pollution related health impacts,academic
the results highly depend on the climate change scenario used and on projections of future air pollution emissions with relatively high uncertainty,academic
studies primarily focused on mortality projections on the effects on morbidity are needed,academic
abstract converging global evidence highlights the dire consequences of climate change for human mental health and wellbeing,academic
this paper summarises literature across relevant disciplines to provide a comprehensive narrative review of the multiple pathways through which climate change interacts with mental health and wellbeing,academic
climate change acts as a risk amplifier by disrupting the conditions known to support good mental health including socioeconomic cultural and environmental conditions and living and working conditions,academic
the disruptive influence of rising global temperatures and extreme weather events such as experiencing a heatwave or water insecurity compounds existing stressors experienced by individuals and communities,academic
this has deleterious effects on people s mental health and is particularly acute for those groups already disadvantaged within and across countries,academic
awareness and experiences of escalating climate threats and climate inaction can generate understandable psychological distress though strong emotional responses can also motivate climate action,academic
we highlight opportunities to support individuals and communities to cope with and act on climate change,academic
consideration of the multiple and interconnected pathways of climate impacts and their influence on mental health determinants must inform evidence based interventions,academic
appropriate action that centres climate justice can reduce the current and future mental health burden while simultaneously improving the conditions that nurture wellbeing and equality,academic
the presented evidence adds further weight to the need for decisive climate action by decision makers across all scales,academic
climate change threatens to reverse the gains in global child health and the reductions in global child mortality made over the past 25 years,academic
there is broad recognition that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are causing climate change,academic

changes in temperature and weather patterns are already occurring,academic
global surface temperatures were the highest ever recorded in 2016 and 9 of the past 10 years were the warmest on record,academic
6 dramatic changes to the climate are expected to occur within the life span of current pediatric patients,academic
the 2013 intergovernmental panel on climate change assessed that global temperatures will likely rise 2 c and may increase 4,academic

backgroundbangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change cc,academic
a basic understanding of public perception on vulnerability attitude and the risk in relation to cc and health will provide strategic directions for government policy adaptation strategies and development of community based guidelines,academic
the objective of this study was to collect community based data on peoples knowledge and perception about cc and its impact on health,academic
methodsin 2012 a cross sectional survey was undertaken among 6720 households of 224 enumeration areas of rural villages geographically distributed in seven vulnerable districts of bangladesh with total population of 19 228 598,academic
thirty households were selected randomly from each enumeration area using the household listing provided by the bangladesh bureau of statistics bbs,academic
information was collected from all the 6720 research participants using a structured questionnaire,academic
an observation checklist was used by the interviewers to collect household and community related information,academic
in addition we selected the head of each household as the eligible participant for an interview,academic
evidence of association between sociodemographic variables and knowledge of cc was explored by cross tabulation and measured using chi square tests,academic
logistic regression models were used to further explore the predictors of knowledge,academic
resultsthe study revealed that the residents of the rural communities selected for this study largely come from a low socioeconomic background only 9,academic
6 had postsecondary education or higher the majority worked as day labourer or farmer 60 and only 10 earned a monthly income above bdt 12000 equivalent to us 150 approx,academic
the majority of the participants 54,academic
2 had some knowledge about cc but 45,academic
8 did not p 0,academic
the majority of knowledgeable participants n 3645 felt excessive temperature as the change of climate 83,academic
among all the respondents n 6720 94,academic
5 perceived change in climate and extreme weather events,academic
most of them 91,academic
9 observed change in rainfall patterns in the last 10 years and 97,academic
8 people think their health care expenditure increased after the extreme weather events,academic
age educational qualification monthly income and occupation were significantly associated with the knowledge about climate change p 0,academic
people with higher educational level or who live near a school were more knowledgeable about cc and its impact on health,academic
conclusionsthe knowledge level about cc in our study group was average but the perception and awareness of cc related events and its impact on health was high,academic
the most influential factor leading to understanding of cc and its impact on health was education,academic
school based intervention could be explored to increase peoples knowledge about cc and necessary health adaptation at community level,academic
abstract climate change has been indicated as a driver for food safety issues worldwide mainly due to the impact on the occurrence of food safety hazards at various stages of food chain,academic
mycotoxins natural contaminants produced by fungi are among the most important of such hazards,academic
aflatoxins which have the highest acute and chronic toxicity of all mycotoxins assume particular importance,academic
a recent study predicted aflatoxin contamination in maize and wheat crops in europe within the next 100 years and aflatoxin b1 is predicted to become a food safety issue in europe especially in the most probable scenario of climate change 2 c,academic
this review discusses the potential influence of climate change on the health risk associated to aflatoxins dietary exposure of portuguese population,academic
we estimated the burden of disease associated to the current aflatoxin exposure for portuguese population in terms of disability adjusted life years dalys,academic
it is expected that in the future the number of dalys and the associated cases of hepatocellular carcinoma due to aflatoxins exposure will increase due to climate change,academic
the topics highlighted through this review including the potential impact on health of the portuguese population through the dietary exposure to aflatoxins should represent an alert for the potential consequences of an incompletely explored perspective of climate change,academic
politics and decision makers should be involved and committed to implement effective measures to deal with climate change issues and to reduce its possible consequences,academic
this review constitutes a contribution for the prioritisation of strategies to face the unequal burden of effects of weather related hazards in portugal and across europe,academic
abstract in 2009 a preliminary framework for how climate change could affect worker safety and health was described,academic
that framework was based on a literature search from 1988 2008 that supported seven categories of climate related occupational hazards 1 increased ambient temperature 2 air pollution 3 ultraviolet radiation exposure 4 extreme weather 5 vector borne diseases and expanded habitats 6 industrial transitions and emerging industries and 7 changes in the built environment,academic
this article reviews the published literature from 2008 2014 in each of the seven categories,academic
additionally three new topics related to occupational safety and health are considered mental health effects economic burden and potential worker safety and health impacts associated with the nascent field of climate intervention geoengineering,academic
beyond updating the literature this article also identifies key priorities for action to better characterize and understand how occupational safety and health may be associated with climate change events and ensure that worker health and safety issues are anticipated recognized evaluated and mitigated,academic
these key priorities include research surveillance risk assessment risk management and policy development,academic
strong evidence indicates that climate change will continue to present occupational safety and health hazards and this framework may be a useful tool for preventing adverse effects to workers,academic
this is the first structured review to identify and summarize research on lifestyle choices that improve health and have the greatest potential to mitigate climate change,academic
two literature searches were conducted on 1 active transport health co benefits and 2 dietary health co benefits,academic
articles needed to quantify both greenhouse gas emissions and health or nutrition outcomes resulting from active transport or diet changes,academic
a data extraction tool prisma was created for article selection and evaluation,academic
a rubric was devised to assess the biases limitations and uncertainties of included articles,academic
for active transport 790 articles were retrieved nine meeting the inclusion criteria,academic
for diet 2524 articles were retrieved 23 meeting the inclusion criteria,academic
a total of 31 articles were reviewed and assessed using the rubric as one article met the inclusion criteria for both active transport and diet co benefits,academic
methods used to estimate the effect of diet or active transport modification vary greatly precluding meta analysis,academic
the scale of impact on health and greenhouse gas emissions ghge outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled versus the modelling technique,academic
effective mitigation policies infrastructure that supports active transport and low ghge food delivery plus community engagement are integral in achieving optimal health and ghge outcomes,academic
variation in culture nutritional and health status plus geographic density will determine which mitigation scenario s best suit individual communities,academic
climate change has received public health attention over the past 3 decades,academic
it is well established that climate change is associated with myriad health issues but less has been mentioned in public health discourse about the impacts of climate change on population mental health,academic
the purpose of the current article is to provide an overview of the impacts of climate change on mental health and to discuss opportunities for mental health nurses to reduce health problems related to climate change,academic
acute events and chronic consequences of climate change can impact mental health outcomes and contribute to depressive disorders anxiety and trauma related disorders,academic
the nursing profession must be prepared to address climate change to promote best health outcomes for individuals around the globe,academic
it is critical that mental health nurses act as leaders in understanding and addressing climate change to improve the mental health of populations,academic

climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughout the world which is a health security threat,academic
climate sensitive infectious disease includes vector borne diseases such as malaria whose transmission potential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability for the mosquito vector in asia sub saharan africa and south america,academic
climatic suitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue zika and chikungunya is also likely to increase facilitating further increases in the geographic range and longer transmission seasons and raising concern for expansion of these diseases into temperate zones particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios,academic
early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to the early onset and extensive west nile virus outbreak in europe a pathogen expected to expand further beyond its current distribution due to a warming climate,academic
as for tick borne diseases climate change is projected to continue to contribute to the spread of lyme disease and tick borne encephalitis particularly in north america and europe,academic
schistosomiasis is a water borne disease and public health concern in africa latin america the middle east and southeast asia climate change is anticipated to change its distribution with both expansions and contractions expected,academic
other water borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseases have declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomic development and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some of these positive developments,academic
weather and climate events population movement land use changes urbanization global trade and other drivers can catalyze a succession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts including infectious disease outbreaks,academic
these cascading risk pathways of causally connected events can result in large scale outbreaks and affect society at large,academic
we review climatic and other cascading drivers of infectious disease with projections under different climate change scenarios,academic

abstract this article provides a brief overview of the implications for children of climate change both of extreme weather events and more gradual changes along with the adaptations likely to be made at various levels,academic
because data on the impacts of climate change tend not to be disaggregated by sub population or by age there is insufficient knowledge to present a comprehensive picture of the impacts for this age group,academic
instead this paper extrapolates from existing knowledge in a number of related areas to present a picture of the probable implications for children s health safety and long term well being especially in lower income countries and communities that are at highest risk from climate change,academic
the article stresses not only children s vulnerability but also their resilience and their capacity as active agents to play a role in addressing the challenges they confront related to climate change,academic
abstract context the amazon region has been part of climate change debates for decades yet attention to its social and health dimensions has been limited,academic
objective this paper assesses literature on the social and health dimensions of climate change in the amazon,academic
a conceptual framework underscores multiple stresses and exposures created by interactions between climate change and local social environmental conditions,academic
methods using the thomson reuter web of science this study bibliometrically assessed the overall literature on climate change in the amazon including physical sciences social sciences anthropology environmental science ecology and public environmental occupational health,academic
from this assessment a relevant sub sample was selected and complemented with literature from the brazilian database scielo,academic
results this sample discusses three dimensions of climate change impacts in the region livelihood changes vector borne diseases and microbial proliferation and respiratory diseases,academic
this analysis elucidates imbalance and disconnect between ecological physical and social and health dimensions of climate change and between continental and regional climate analysis and sub regional and local levels,academic
conclusion work on the social and health implications of climate change in the amazon falls significantly behind other research areas limiting reliable information for analytical models and for amazonian policy makers and society at large,academic
collaborative research is called for,academic
there has been much debate as to whether or not climate change will have or has had any significant effect on risk from vector borne diseases,academic
the debate on the former has focused on the degree to which occurrence and levels of risk of vector borne diseases are determined by climate dependent or independent factors while the debate on the latter has focused on whether changes in disease incidence are due to climate at all and or are attributable to recent climate change,academic
here i review possible effects of climate change on vector borne diseases methods used to predict these effects and the evidence to date of changes in vector borne disease risks that can be attributed to recent climate change,academic
predictions have both over and underestimated the effects of climate change,academic
mostly under estimations of effects are due to a focus only on direct effects of climate on disease ecology while more distal effects on society s capacity to control and prevent vector borne disease are ignored,academic
there is increasing evidence for possible impacts of recent climate change on some vector borne diseases but for the most part observed data series are too short or non existent and impacts of climate independent factors too great to confidently attribute changing risk to climate change,academic
aims the climate emergency will likely prove this century s greatest threat to public health within which mental health effects need consideration,academic
while studies consistently show the majority of australians are very concerned about the impacts of climate change there is limited evidence from nation wide research linking climate change with mental health burden in sub populations,academic
this study aimed to understand the impact of climate change on mental health in the australian population and identify populations who are most at risk of climate related mental health burden,academic
methods a nation wide australian survey conducted between august and november 2020 of adults was approximately representative across sex age location state and area disadvantage,academic
two stage recruitment involved unrestricted self selected community sample through mainstream and social media n 4428 and purposeful sampling using an online panel n 1055,academic
results most australians report having a direct experience of a climate change related event,academic
young people are experiencing significant rates of eco anxiety,academic
one in four people with direct experience of a climate change related event met post traumatic stress disorder screening criteria,academic
people who have not had a direct experience are showing symptoms of pre trauma particularly in younger age groups and women,academic
there were 9,academic
37 503 5370 of respondents with responses indicating significant eco anxiety 15,academic
68 370 2359 with pre traumatic stress and 25,academic
60 727 2840 with post traumatic stress disorder,academic
multivariable regressions confirmed that younger people are more affected by eco anxiety and post traumatic stress disorder pre or post trauma women are more affected by post traumatic stress disorder pre or post trauma and those from more disadvantaged regions are more affected by eco anxiety,academic
conclusion australia is facing a potential mental health crisis,academic
individuals with and without direct experience of climate change are reporting significant mental health impacts with younger age groups being disproportionately affected,academic
there are key roles for clinicians and other health professionals in responding to and preventing climate related mental health burden,academic
climate change is an enormous challenge for our communities our country and our world,academic
recently much attention has been paid to the physical impacts of climate change including extreme heat events droughts extreme storms and rising sea levels,academic
however much less attention has been paid to the psychological impacts,academic
this article examines the likely psychological impacts of climate change including anxiety stress and depression increases in violence and aggression and loss of community identity,academic
nurses can play a vital role in local and regional climate strategies by preparing their patients health care facilities and communities to effectively address the anticipated mental health impacts of climate change,academic
climate change can have a complex impact that also influences human and animal health,academic
for example climate change alters the conditions for pathogens and vectors of zoonotic diseases,academic
signs of this are the increasing spread of the west nile and usutu viruses and the establishment of new vector species such as specific mosquito and tick species in europe and other parts of the world,academic
with these changes come new challenges for maintaining human and animal health,academic
this paper reports on an analysis of the literature focused on a bibliometric analysis of the scopus database and vosviewer software for creating visualization maps which identifies the zoonotic health risks for humans and animals caused by climate change,academic
the sources retained for the analysis totaled 428 and different thresholds n were established for each item varying from n 5 to 10,academic
the main findings are as follows first published documents increased in 2009 2015 peaking in 2020,academic
second the primary sources have changed since 2018 partly attributable to the increase in human health concerns due to human to human transmission,academic
third the usa the uk canada australia italy and germany perform most zoonosis research,academic
for instance sixty documents and only 17 countries analyzed for co authorship analysis met the threshold led by the usa the top four author keywords were climate change zoonosis epidemiology and one health the usa the uk germany and spain led the link strength inter collaboration the author keywords showed that 37 out of the 1023 keywords met the threshold and the authors keyword s largest node of the bibliometric map contains the following infectious diseases emerging diseases disease ecology one health surveillance transmission and wildlife,academic
finally zoonotic diseases which were documented in the literature in the past have evolved especially during the years 2010 2015 as evidenced by the sharp augmentation of publications addressing ad hoc events and peaking in 2020 with the covid 19 outbreak,academic
purpose general practitioners gps could play a role in mitigating climate change by raising awareness of its impact on human health and implementing changes to improve population health and decreasing environmental footprints,academic
the aim of this study was to assess gps knowledge and perspectives about the health impacts of climate change,academic
method a questionnaire was sent to 1972 gps in the french speaking part of switzerland,academic
knowledge of the impact of environmental degradations and climate change on health and willingness to address climate change with patients to be exemplary and to act as role models were surveyed as well as demographic characteristics of gps,academic
results respondents n 497 expressed a high level of self reported knowledge regarding climate change although it was lower for more specific topics such as planetary health or health environment co benefits,academic
participants mostly agreed that it is necessary to adapt clinical practice to the health impacts of climate change and that they have a role in providing information on climate change and its links to human health,academic
conclusion most of the gps were concerned about environmental and climate degradation,academic
however this study revealed a gap between the willingness of gps to integrate the impact of climate change on health into their clinical activities and their lack of overall knowledge and scientific evidence on effective interventions,academic
a promising way forward may be to develop co benefit interventions adapted to the clinical setting on diet active mobility and connecting with nature,academic
it is clear that the public health community is concerned about the human health impacts of climate change but are we inadvertently underestimating the scope of the problem and obfuscating potentially useful interventions by using a narrow intellectual frame in our discussions with policy makers,academic
if we take a more holistic approach we see that the public health impacts of climate change are only one subset of the enormous public health impacts of fossil fuel burning,academic
this broader perspective can provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment that is more useful for decision making in public policy settings,academic
climate change and mental health concerns are both defining issues of the generation of today,academic
it has been established that the worsening climate causes many environmental disasters and physical health problems,academic
however its psychological impacts are still not well understood,academic
climate change has brought about an emerging psychological phenomenon termed climate anxiety or eco anxiety which has been described as a chronic fear of environmental doom clayton et al,academic
2017 p,academic
68 due to the impact of climate change,academic
this predictive cross sectional study investigated the link between climate change anxiety and mental health among 433 filipinos,academic
a total of 145 males and 288 females aged 18 to 26 completed the climate change anxiety scale and the mental health inventory mhi 38,academic
results show a significant relationship between climate change anxiety and mental health with climate change anxiety predicting 13,academic
5 of the overall mental health index variance,academic
significantly climate change anxiety was associated with the mhi 38 s global scale of psychological distress but not with the global scale of psychological well being,academic
the findings are discussed concerning the broader context of research on the mental health impacts of climate change,academic
the health impacts of climate are widely recognised and extensive modelling is available on predicted changes to climate globally,academic
the impact of these changes may affect populations differently depending on a range of factors including geography socioeconomics and culture,academic
this study reviewed current evidence on the health risks of climate change for australian aboriginal populations and linked aboriginal demographic data to historical and projected climate data to describe the distribution of climate related exposures in aboriginal compared to non aboriginal populations in new south wales nsw australia,academic
the study showed aboriginal populations were disproportionately exposed to a range of climate extremes in heat rainfall and drought and this disproportionate exposure was predicted to increase with climate change over the coming decades,academic
aboriginal people currently experience higher rates of climate sensitive health conditions and socioeconomic disadvantages which will impact their capacity to adapt to climate change,academic
climate change may also adversely affect cultural practices,academic
these factors will likely impact the health and well being of aboriginal people in nsw and inhibit measures to close the gap in health between aboriginal and non aboriginal populations,academic
climate change health and equity need to be key considerations in all policies at all levels of government,academic
effective aboriginal community engagement is urgently needed to develop and implement climate adaptation responses to improve health and social service preparedness and secure environmental health infrastructure such as drinking water supplies and suitably managed social housing,academic
further aboriginal led research is required to identify the cultural impacts of climate change on health including adaptive responses based on aboriginal knowledges,academic
context climate change poses a host of serious threats to human health that robust public health surveillance systems can help address,academic
it is unknown however whether existing surveillance systems in the united states have adequate capacity to serve that role nor what actions may be needed to develop adequate capacity,academic
objective our goals were to review efforts to assess and strengthen the capacity of public health surveillance systems to support health related adaptation to climate change in the united states and to determine whether additional efforts are warranted,academic
methods building on frameworks issued by the intergovernmental panel on climate change and the centers for disease control and prevention we specified 4 core components of public health surveillance capacity relevant to climate change health threats,academic
using standard methods we next identified and analyzed multiple assessments of the existing relevant capacity of public health surveillance systems as well as attempts to improve that capacity,academic
we also received information from selected national public health associations,academic
findings multiple federal state and local public health agencies professional associations and researchers have made valuable initial efforts to assess and strengthen surveillance capacity,academic
these efforts however have been made by entities working independently and without the benefit of a shared conceptual framework or strategy,academic
their principal focus has been on identifying suitable indicators and data sources largely to the exclusion of other core components of surveillance capacity,academic
conclusions a more comprehensive and strategic approach is needed to build the public health surveillance capacity required to protect the health of americans in a world of rapidly evolving climate change,academic
public health practitioners and policy makers at all levels can use the findings and issues reviewed in this article as they lead design and execution of a coordinated multisector strategic plan to create and sustain that capacity,academic
climate change poses a major threat to public health,academic
strategies that address climate change have considerable potential to benefit health and decrease health inequities yet public health engagement at the intersection of public health equity and climate change has been limited,academic
this research seeks to understand the barriers to and opportunities for advancing work at this nexus,academic
we conducted semi structured in depth interviews n 113 with public health and climate change professionals and thematic analysis,academic
barriers to public health engagement in addressing climate change include individual perceptions that climate change is not urgent or solvable and insufficient understanding of climate change s health impacts and programmatic connections,academic
institutional barriers include a lack of public health capacity authority and leadership a narrow framework for public health practice that limits work on the root causes of climate change and health and compartmentalization within and across sectors,academic
opportunities include integrating climate change into current public health practice providing inter sectoral support for climate solutions with health co benefits and using a health frame to engage and mobilize communities,academic
efforts to increase public health sector engagement should focus on education and communications building leadership and funding and increasing work on the shared root causes of climate change and health inequities,academic
aim the purpose of this study was to explore canadian nurses perspectives on climate change health nursing practice and the relationships between these concepts,academic
background climate change negatively impacts human health,academic
with a mandate to promote health nurses have a professional and ethical responsibility to address climate change,academic
little is known about canadian nurses perspectives on climate change or how they perceive of their professional responsibility towards addressing it,academic
methods a focused ethnography was conducted in three medicine units and the emergency room at a canadian hospital,academic
nurses n 22 participated in semi structured interviews and observations were collected,academic
data were analysed via thematic analysis,academic
reporting is in accordance with the coreq guideline,academic
results three themes were identified muddled terminology climate change and health and nursing s relationship to climate change,academic
conclusion participants had varying levels of knowledge about climate change and its relationship to health or practice,academic
climate change was a personal concern and nursing s role in addressing it was not understood,academic
relevance to practice this study highlighted that practicing nurses did not readily recognize their role in addressing climate change,academic
more work is needed to clarify this role and bring it into the consciousness of every day nursing practice,academic
furthermore more work is needed to examine how healthcare organizations can better support environmentally responsible nursing practice,academic
introduction climate change lies at the heart of many complex humanitarian emergencies and emerging global health challenges with sub saharan africa ssa identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of climate change,academic
1 an arc stretching from somalia and eritrea in the east to mauritania in the west forms a band of countries that are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change figure 1,academic
2 this arc experiences a devastating combination of state fragmentation islamist insurgency and climate change undermining livelihood strategies across the region,academic
a climate injustice exists despite contributing relatively little to the anthropogenic causes of climate change individuals living in these countries face the most severe impacts,academic
aquaculture is the productive activity that will play a crucial role in the challenges of the millennium such as the need for proteins that support humans and the respect for the environment,academic
aquaculture is an important economic activity in the mediterranean basin,academic
a great impact is presented however by aquaculture practices as they involve the use of antibiotics for treatment and prophylaxis,academic
as a consequence of the use of antibiotics in aquaculture antibiotic resistance is induced in the surrounding bacteria in the column water sediment and fish associated bacterial strains,academic
through horizontal gene transfer bacteria can diffuse antibiotic resistance genes and mobile resistance genes further spreading genetic determinants,academic
once triggered antibiotic resistance easily spreads among aquatic microbial communities and from there can reach human pathogenic bacteria making vain the use of antibiotics for human health,academic
climate change claims a significant role in this context as rising temperatures can affect cell physiology in bacteria in the same way as antibiotics causing antibiotic resistance to begin with,academic
the mediterranean sea represents a hot spot in terms of climate change and aspects of antibiotic resistance in aquaculture in this area can be significantly amplified thus increasing threats to human health,academic
practices must be adopted to counteract negative impacts on human health with a reduction in the use of antibiotics as a pivotal point,academic
in the meantime it is necessary to act against climate change by reducing anthropogenic impacts for example by reducing co2 emissions into the atmosphere,academic
the one health type approach which involves the intervention of different skills such as veterinary ecology and medicine in compliance with the principles of sustainability is necessary and strongly recommended to face these important challenges for human and animal health and for environmental safety in the mediterranean area,academic
climate change represents one of the largest global health threats of the 21st century with immediate and long term consequences for the most vulnerable populations especially in the poorest countries with the least capacity to adapt to climate change,academic
pregnant women and newborns are increasingly being recognized as vulnerable populations in the context of climate change,academic
the effects can be direct or indirect through heat stress extreme weather events and air pollution potentially impacting both the immediate and long term health of pregnant women and newborns through a broad range of mechanisms,academic
in 2008 the world health organization passed a resolution during the 61st world health assembly recognizing the need for research to identify strategies and health system strengthening to mitigate the effects of climate change on health,academic
climate adaptation plans need to consider vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and neonates and a broad multisectoral approach to improve overall resilience of societies,academic
climate change threatens mental health via increasing exposure to the social and economic disruptions created by extreme weather and large scale climatic events as well as through the anxiety associated with recognising the existential threat posed by the climate crisis,academic
considering the growing levels of climate change awareness across the world negative emotions like anxiety and worry about climate related risks are a potentially pervasive conduit for the adverse impacts of climate change on mental health,academic
in this study we examined how negative climate related emotions relate to sleep and mental health among a diverse non representative sample of individuals recruited from 25 countries as well as a norwegian nationally representative sample,academic
overall we found that negative climate related emotions are positively associated with insomnia symptoms and negatively related to self rated mental health in most countries,academic
our findings suggest that climate related psychological stressors are significantly linked with mental health in many countries and draw attention to the need for cross disciplinary research aimed at achieving rigorous empirical assessments of the unique challenge posed to mental health by negative emotional responses to climate change,academic
health professionals are increasingly urged to act to protect individuals and populations against the negative effects of climate and environment change on health,academic
however the amount of evidence supporting initiatives to that end is unknown,academic
we explored the literature examining the awareness preparedness and role of healthcare professionals to inform about the impact of climate change on health on the one hand and literature about the effectiveness of interventions mediated by health professionals aiming at reducing the environmental impact of human activities on the other hand,academic
we included 137 articles published between 2000 and 2020 mostly in general medical and nursing journals,academic
the typical article was a perspective commentary or other special article aimed at alerting readers about the impact of climate and environment change on health,academic
we identified 22 studies of which only two reported interventions,academic
despite increasing efforts of health professionals to address climate and environment change and related health risks health literature supporting such efforts remains scarce and studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions are lacking,academic
we need appropriate evidence to indicate which interventions should be prioritized considering that the association of health issues with climate and environment change could constitute an effective lever for change,academic

vector borne diseases continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world,academic
all are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases,academic
here we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge and outline related initiatives by the world health organization who and its partners,academic
much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to climate change and the use of scenario based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases,academic
while these can give useful indications the unavoidable uncertainty in such analyses and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future limit their utility as decision support tools,academic
for operational health agencies the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down current disease rates and manage short term climate risks which will in turn increase resilience to long term climate change,academic
the who and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to i ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens ii promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management iii support applied research through definition of global and regional research agendas and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups,academic
we evaluate the impact of climate change on u,academic
air quality and health in 2050 and 2100 using a global modeling framework and integrated economic climate and air pollution projections,academic
three internally consistent socioeconomic scenarios are used to value health benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation policies specifically derived from slowing climate change,academic
our projections suggest that climate change exclusive of changes in air pollutant emissions can significantly impact ozone o3 and fine particulate matter pm2,academic
5 pollution across the u,academic
and increase associated health effects,academic
climate policy can substantially reduce these impacts and climate related air pollution health benefits alone can offset a significant fraction of mitigation costs,academic
we find that in contrast to cobenefits from reductions to coemitted pollutants the climate induced air quality benefits of policy increase with time and are largest between 2050 and 2100,academic
our projections also suggest that increasing climate policy stringency beyond a certain degree may lead to diminishing returns relative to its cost,academic
however our results indicate that the air quality impacts of climate change are substantial and should be considered by cost benefit climate policy analyses,academic
tropospheric ozone can be dangerous to human health can be harmful to vegetation and is a major contributor to climate warming,academic
black carbon also has significant negative effects on health and air quality and causes warming of the atmosphere,academic
shindell et al,academic
183 present results of an analysis of emissions atmospheric processes and impacts for each of these pollutants,academic
seven measures were identified that if rapidly implemented would significantly reduce global warming over the next 50 years with the potential to prevent millions of deaths worldwide from outdoor air pollution,academic
furthermore some crop yields could be improved by decreasing agricultural damage,academic
most of the measures thus appear to have economic benefits well above the cost of their implementation,academic
reducing anthropogenic emissions of methane and black carbon would have multiple climate and health benefits,academic
tropospheric ozone and black carbon bc contribute to both degraded air quality and global warming,academic
we considered 400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience,academic
we identified 14 measures targeting methane and bc emissions that reduce projected global mean warming 0,academic
5 c by 2050,academic
this strategy avoids 0,academic
7 to 4,academic
7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond,academic
benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at 700 to 5000 per metric ton which is well above typical marginal abatement costs less than 250,academic
the selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide reduction measures,academic
implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2 c threshold,academic
background the empirical assessment of the health outcomes associated with migration caused by climate change is still unclear,academic
however health outcomes in the early stages are expected to be similar to the health outcomes associated with refugees,academic
the objective of the present study was a systematic review of the health effects of migration caused by climate change,academic
methodology a systematic review was conducted according to the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses guidelines,academic
online databases pubmed scopus web of science and google scholar were used to identify papers published that evaluated the health effects of migration caused by climate change,academic
the search article selection and data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently,academic
all english language articles on the health effects of migration caused by climate change were included in this study,academic
results an analysis of the complex ways in which climate change influences populations can be facilitated using a three class classification compulsory displacement resettlement planning and migration,academic
subsequent to climate changes other changes and environmental deficiencies compulsory displacement may occur in case of inadequacy of compatibility responses,academic
a part of migration related health outcomes caused by climate change is from displacement from rural to urban areas especially in developing countries,academic
there is significant documentation on health and livelihood inequalities between migrant groups and host populations in developed countries,academic
conclusion if climate change continues in its current direction it is likely that the number of refugees and crises will increase in the coming decades,academic
although the domain and the extent of health hazards caused by the displacement of the population associated with climate change cannot be clearly predicted by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions along with social and environmental adaptation strategies migration caused by climate change health risks and its relevant crises can be greatly reduced,academic
climate change is one of the major global health threats to the world s population,academic
it is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity including burning fossil fuels carbon dioxide animal husbandry methane from manure industry emissions ozone nitrogen oxides sulfur dioxide vehicle factory exhaust and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth s atmosphere,academic
resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires air pollution changes in ecology and floods,academic
these in turn result in displacement of populations family disruption violence and major impacts on water quality and availability food security public health and economic infrastructures and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety,academic
climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well being,academic
particularly vulnerable populations are affected including women pregnant women children the disabled and the elderly who comprise the majority of the poor globally,academic
additionally the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities including low income and communities of color and lower income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status,academic
the climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women s sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health,academic
obstetrician gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness educate and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families,academic
this article puts climate change in the context of women s reproductive health as a public health issue a social justice issue a human rights issue an economic issue a political issue and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well being of this and future generations,academic
figo joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people developing fetuses and reproductive health and recognizing that we need society wide solutions government policies and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors including fossil fuel production to climate change,academic
climate change adaptation responses are being developed and delivered in many parts of the world in the absence of detailed knowledge of their effects on public health,academic
here we present the results of a systematic review of peer reviewed literature reporting the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses in low and middle income countries lmics,academic
the review used the global adaptation mapping initiative database comprising 1682 publications related to climate change adaptation responses that was constructed through systematic literature searches in scopus web of science and google scholar 2013 2020,academic
for this study further screening was performed to identify studies from lmics reporting the effects on human health of climate change adaptation responses,academic
studies were categorised by study design and data were extracted on geographic region population under investigation type of adaptation response and reported health effects,academic
the review identified 99 studies 1117 reported outcomes reporting evidence from 66 lmics,academic
only two studies were ex ante formal evaluations of climate change adaptation responses,academic
papers reported adaptation responses related to flooding rainfall drought and extreme heat predominantly through behaviour change and infrastructural and technological improvements,academic
reported direct and intermediate health outcomes included reduction in infectious disease incidence improved access to water sanitation and improved food security,academic
all cause mortality was rarely reported and no papers were identified reporting on maternal and child health,academic
reported maladaptations were predominantly related to widening of inequalities and unforeseen co harms,academic
reporting and publication bias seems likely with only 3,academic
5 of all 1117 health outcomes reported to be negative,academic
our review identified some evidence that climate change adaptation responses may have benefits for human health but the overall paucity of evidence is concerning and represents a major missed opportunity for learning,academic
there is an urgent need for greater focus on the funding design evaluation and standardised reporting of the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses to enable evidence based policy action,academic
land is a vital natural resource for human socio ecological wellbeing,academic
around the world land is being degraded due to various natural and anthropogenic factors such as flooding wind erosion agriculture and human settlement and anthropogenic climate change,academic
while significant research has been conducted on the separate dyads of 1 anthropogenic climate change and land degradation and 2 land degradation and health limited consideration has been given to the cause and effect relationships between anthropogenic climate change triggered land degradation and planetary health consequences,academic
using a systematic literature review and the driving force pressure state exposure effect dpsee framework this study synthesizes the complex causal relationships of anthropogenic climate change triggered land degradation and its planetary health consequences,academic
our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic climate change has induced and accelerated natural and anthropogenic land degradation through an array of pathways resulting in planetary health consequences that can be grouped into six categories 1 food and nutritional insecurity 2 communicable and noncommunicable diseases 3 livelihood insecurity 4 physical and mental health 5 health hazards related to extreme weather events and 6 migration and conflict,academic
interlinkages exist between these six planetary health impact categories adding to the complexity of the causal pathways,academic
these collective impacts are hampering the realization of the un sustainable development goals around the world,academic
the findings of this study and our dpsee framework can help policymakers identify and integrate actions to better manage the planetary health impacts of climate change induced land degradation,academic
small island developing states sids are often at the forefront of climate change impacts including those related to health but information on mental health and wellbeing is typically underreported,academic
to help address this research lacuna this paper reviews research about mental health and wellbeing under climate change in sids,academic
due to major differences in the literature s methodologies results and analyses the method is an overview and qualitative evidence synthesis of peer reviewed publications,academic
the findings show that mental health and wellbeing in the context of climate change have yet to feature prominently and systematically in research covering sids,academic
it seems likely that major adverse mental health and wellbeing impacts linked to climate change impacts will affect sids peoples,academic
similar outcomes might also emerge when discussing climate change related situations scenarios and responses irrespective of what has actually happened thus far due to climate change,academic
in the context of inadequate health systems and stigmatisation of mental health diagnoses and treatments as tends to occur globally climate change narratives might present an opening for conversations about addressing mental health and wellbeing issues for sids,academic
climate change is a worldwide challenge,academic
its consequences do encompass severe threats not only for the existence and somatic health but also for the mental health of children and adolescents,academic
mental health can be impaired by three types of consequences,academic
direct consequences of climate change such as natural disasters and indirect consequences such as loss of land flight and migration exposure to violence change of social ecological economic or cultural environment,academic
moreover the increasing awareness of the existential dimension of climate change in children and adolescents can influence their well being or challenge their mental health,academic
consequences of climate change for somatic health may interact with mental health or have psychological sequelae in children and adolescents,academic
based on the estimates by the united nations intergovernmental panel on climate change we have summarized current data on these differential pathways as to how climate change affects the mental health of children worldwide through selective literature research on pubmed,academic
mental health sequelae of direct and indirect consequences of climate change increased awareness and physical health problems caused by climate change are presented,academic
we give insights into special vulnerabilities of children and adolescents and identify high risk groups,academic
as the fridays for future movement has been initiated in northern europe we will discuss these results with a focus on children and adolescents in europe,academic
the results indicate that climate change is a serious threat to children and adolescent mental health,academic
children s rights mental health and climate change should not continue to be seen as separate points instead they need to be brought together to address this major challenge determining the future of our children and their descendants,academic
anthropogenic climate change is adversely impacting people and contributing to suffering and increased costs from climate related diseases and injuries,academic
in responding to this urgent and growing public health crisis mitigation strategies are in place to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions ghge while adaptation strategies exist to reduce and or alleviate the adverse effects of climate change by increasing systems resilience to future impacts,academic
while these strategies have numerous positive benefits on climate change itself they also often have other positive externalities or health co benefits,academic
this knowledge can be harnessed to promote and improve global public health particularly for the most vulnerable populations,academic
previous conceptual models in mitigation and adaptation studies such as the shared socioeconomic pathways ssps considered health in the thinking but health outcomes were not their primary intention,academic
additionally existing guidance documents such as the world health organization who guidance for climate resilient and environmentally sustainable health care facilities is designed primarily for public health professionals or healthcare managers in hospital settings with a primary focus on resilience,academic
however a detailed cross sectoral and multidisciplinary conceptual framework which links mitigation and adaptation strategies with health outcomes as a primary end point has not yet been developed to guide research in this area,academic
in this paper we briefly summarize the burden of climate change on global public health describe important mitigation and adaptation strategies and present key health benefits by giving context specific examples from high middle and low income settings,academic
we then provide a conceptual framework to inform future global public health research and preparedness across sectors and disciplines and outline key stakeholders recommendations in promoting climate resilient systems and advancing health equity,academic
there is wide scale concern about the effects of red meat on human health and climate change,academic
plant based meat alternatives designed to mimic the sensory experience and nutritional value of red meat have recently been introduced into consumer markets,academic
plant based meats are marketed under the premise of environmental and human health benefits and are aimed appeal to a broad consumer base,academic
meat production is critiqued for its overuse of water supplies landscape degradation and greenhouse gas emission and depending on production practices environmental footprints may be lower with plant based meat alternatives,academic
life cycle analyses suggest that the novel plant based meat alternatives have an environmental footprint that may be lower than beef finished in feedlots but higher than beef raised on well managed pastures,academic
in this review we discuss the nutritional and ecological impacts of eating plant based meat alternatives vs,academic
most humans fall on a spectrum of omnivory they satisfy some nutrient requirements better from plant foods while needs for other nutrients are met more readily from animal foods,academic
animal foods also facilitate the uptake of several plant derived nutrients zinc and iron while plant nutrients can offer protection against potentially harmful compounds in cooked meat,academic
thus plant and animal foods operate in symbiotic ways to improve human health,academic
the mimicking of animal foods using isolated plant proteins fats vitamins and minerals likely underestimates the true nutritional complexity of whole foods in their natural state which contain hundreds to thousands of nutrients that impact human health,academic
novel plant based meat alternatives should arguably be treated as meat alternatives in terms of sensory experience but not as true meat replacements in terms of nutrition,academic
if consumers wish to replace some of their meat with plant based alternatives in the diet a flexitarian approach this is unlikely to negatively impact their overall nutrient status but this also depends on what other foods are in their diet and the life stage of the individual,academic
the rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere,academic
climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations,academic
it also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems including degradation defaunation and fragmentation,academic
there is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change,academic
at the same time ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of and adaptation to climate change,academic
the mechanisms potential and limits of such nature based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified,academic
this paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere,academic
it explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate,academic
it draws on a royal society national academy of sciences forum held in washington dc in november 2018 where these themes and issues were discussed,academic
we conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse resilient and well functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty first century,academic
this article is part of the theme issue climate change and ecosystems threats opportunities and solutions,academic
climate change has altered global to local weather patterns and increased sea levels and it will continue to do so,academic
average temperatures precipitation amounts and other variables such as humidity levels are all rising,academic
in addition weather variability is increasing causing for example a greater number of heat waves many of which are more intense and last longer and more floods and droughts,academic
these changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries illnesses and deaths from a wide range of climate sensitive health outcomes,academic
future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks,academic
these risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events for example heat waves storms and floods infectious diseases including food water and vectorborne illnesses and food and water insecurity,academic
these risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist,academic
most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming,academic
using an equity lens to move beyond incremental to transformational resilience would reduce vulnerability and improve sustainability for all but substantial additional funding is required for proactive and effective actions by the health system,academic
one of our era s greatest scourges is air pollution on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality,academic
there are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans,academic
among them particulate matter pm particles of variable but very small diameter penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions and cancer,academic
despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system,academic
furthermore nitrogen oxide sulfur dioxide volatile organic compounds vocs dioxins and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons pahs are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans,academic
carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels,academic
heavy metals such as lead when absorbed into the human body can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication depending on exposure,academic
diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd asthma bronchiolitis and also lung cancer cardiovascular events central nervous system dysfunctions and cutaneous diseases,academic
last but not least climate change resulting from environmental pollution affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases as do natural disasters,academic
the only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary approach by scientific experts national and international organizations must address the emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions,academic
background knowledge about climate change may produce anxiety but the concept of climate change anxiety is poorly understood,academic
the primary aim of this study was to systematically review the qualitative literature regarding the scope of anxiety responses to climate change,academic
the secondary aim was to investigate the sociodemographic and geographical factors which influence experiences of climate change anxiety,academic
methods a systematic review of empirical qualitative studies was undertaken examining the scope of climate change anxiety by searching five databases,academic
studies were critically appraised for quality,academic
content analysis was used to identify themes,academic
results fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria,academic
the content analysis was organised into two overarching themes,academic
the scope of anxiety included worry about threats to livelihood worry for future generations worry about apocalyptic futures anxiety at the lack of response to climate change and competing worries,academic
themes pertaining to responses to climate change anxiety included symptoms of anxiety feeling helpless and disempowered and ways of managing climate change anxiety,academic
relatively few studies were identified with limited geographical diversity amongst the populations studied,academic
conclusions the review furthers understanding of the concept of climate change anxiety and responses to it highlighting the need for high quality psychiatric research exploring its clinical significance and potential interventions,academic
rising global temperature is causing major physical chemical and ecological changes across the planet,academic
there is wide consensus among scientific organizations and climatologists that these broad effects known as climate change are the result of contemporary human activity,academic
climate change poses threats to human health safety and security,academic
children are uniquely vulnerable to these threats,academic
the effects of climate change on child health include physical and psychological sequelae of weather disasters increased heat stress decreased air quality altered disease patterns of some climate sensitive infections and food water and nutrient insecurity in vulnerable regions,academic
prompt implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies will protect children against worsening of the problem and its associated health effects,academic
this technical report reviews the nature of climate change and its associated child health effects and supports the recommendations in the accompanying policy statement on climate change and children s health,academic
abstract human induced climate change in australia is affecting the frequency and intensity of extreme events including bushfires cyclones and drought,academic
human health is affected by these climate impacts through direct impacts which include injuries and death from extreme events indirect impacts through natural system changes such as impacts on water food and air and indirect impacts on human systems including mental health productivity and damage to housing and health care facilities,academic
remote settlements are vulnerable to these climate impacts and associated health impacts due to isolated location quality of the infrastructure economic resources limited transport and existing health vulnerabilities that enable resilience or vulnerability,academic
remote indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable,academic
this research sought to identify vulnerabilities of human health of residents in remote indigenous communities to human induced climate change to contribute to adequate responses of prevention and preparation,academic
summary future climate change is predicted to diminish essential natural resource availability in many regions and perhaps globally,academic
the resulting scarcity of water food and livelihoods could lead to increasingly desperate populations that challenge governments enhancing the risk of intra and interstate conflict,academic
defence establishments and some political scientists view climate change as a potential threat to peace,academic
while the medical literature increasingly recognises climate change as a fundamental health risk the dimension of climate change associated conflict has so far received little attention despite its profound health implications,academic
many analysts link climate change with a heightened risk of conflict via causal pathways which involve diminishing or changing resource availability,academic
plausible consequences include increased frequency of civil conflict in developing countries terrorism asymmetric warfare state failure and major regional conflicts,academic
the medical understanding of these threats is inadequate given the scale of health implications,academic
the medical and public health communities have often been reluctant to interpret conflict as a health issue,academic
however at times medical workers have proven powerful and effective peace advocates most notably with regard to nuclear disarmament,academic
the public is more motivated to mitigate climate change when it is framed as a health issue,academic
improved medical understanding of the association between climate change and conflict could strengthen mitigation efforts and increase cooperation to cope with the climate change that is now inevitable,academic
the worrying environmental situation and increased public awareness in recent years have led many countries to take measures to reduce negative impacts on the environment,academic
the european union eu has been one of the most active in environmental protection with the formulation of policies aimed at preserving the health and well being of citizens and protecting natural resources,academic
one of the objectives of environmental policies is to make the economy of its member states more environmentally friendly although this requires finding solutions to major challenges such as climate change the scarcity of natural resources the emission of polluting gases and unsustainable consumption and production,academic
this article reviews the main policies that have been implemented in the eu to reduce environmental problems and the scope of climate change conferences,academic
it offers solutions to promote sustainability that could be adopted by companies individuals and governmental institutions to jointly contribute to achieving a more sustainable world where problems such as climate change or the emission of polluting gases are minimized,academic
the aim is to follow the principles of the circular economy and the european green deal,academic

the climate has changed significantly under the influence of human behavior,academic
and first of all this is due to the change in the proportionality and concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere water vapor carbon dioxide methane ozone pfc perfluorocarbons,academic
this paper analyzes the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions,academic
climate change has many consequences on human health throughout the world especially in african countries,academic
the growth of greenhouse gas emissions is viewed as a cause of infectious and non infectious diseases negative effects on nutrition water security and other social disruptions,academic
the global average temperature gradually increases and the atmospheric co2 concentration has exceeded 400 ppm due to the intensification of greenhouse effect,academic
the method of energy balance was featured to simulate the trends in greenhouse gas emission forecast in different sectors until 2030,academic
through sensitivity analysis we found that the reduction of anthropogenic co2 emissions from people cars and households would deescalate the consequences of the above trends,academic
emissions are mostly associated with industries which can be reduced if local government will want to achieve the paris agreement goal,academic
climate change and hiv aids represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century,academic
however limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of hiv aids in the context of a rapidly changing climate,academic
here we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with hiv aids transmission and health outcomes increased food insecurity increased prevalence of other infectious diseases increased human migration and erosion of public health infrastructure,academic
this framework is based on an in depth literature review in pubmed and google scholar from june 6 to june 27 2019,academic
the pathways linking climate change with hiv transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors,academic
food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk taking behaviours and migration as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with hiv plwhiv,academic
future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies particularly in those areas of sub saharan africa and southeast asia heavily impacted by both hiv and climate change,academic
environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co benefits that may help plwhiv adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change,academic
background climate change is expected to alter the global footprint of many infectious diseases particularly vector borne diseases such as malaria and dengue,academic
knowledge of the range and geographical context of expected climate change impacts on disease transmission and spread combined with knowledge of effective adaptation strategies and responses can help to identify gaps and best practices to mitigate future health impacts,academic
to investigate the types of evidence for impacts of climate change on two major mosquito borne diseases of global health importance malaria and dengue and to identify the range of relevant policy responses and adaptation strategies that have been devised we performed a scoping review of published review literature,academic
three electronic databases pubmed scopus and epistemonikos were systematically searched for relevant published reviews,academic
inclusion criteria were reviews with a systematic search from 2007 to 2020 in english or french that addressed climate change impacts and or adaptation strategies related to malaria and or dengue,academic
data extracted included characteristics of the article type of review disease s of focus geographic focus and nature of the evidence,academic
the evidence was summarized to identify and compare regional evidence for climate change impacts and adaptation measures,academic
results a total of 32 reviews met the inclusion criteria,academic
evidence for the impacts of climate change including climate variability on dengue was greatest in the southeast asian region while evidence for the impacts of climate change on malaria was greatest in the african region particularly in highland areas,academic
few reviews explicitly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies to address climate change driven disease transmission however suggested strategies included enhanced surveillance early warning systems predictive models and enhanced vector control,academic
conclusions there is strong evidence for the impacts of climate change including climate variability on the transmission and future spread of malaria and dengue two of the most globally important vector borne diseases,academic
further efforts are needed to develop multi sectoral climate change adaptation strategies to enhance the capacity and resilience of health systems and communities especially in regions with predicted climatic suitability for future emergence and re emergence of malaria and dengue,academic
this scoping review may serve as a useful precursor to inform future systematic reviews of the primary literature,academic
menarche is the first occurrence of a woman s menstruation an event that symbolizes reproductive capacity and the transition from childhood into womanhood,academic
the global average age for menarche is 12 years and this has been declining in recent years,academic
many factors that affect the timing menarche in girls could be affected by climate change,academic
a systematic literature review was performed regarding the timing of menarche and four publication databases were interrogated embase scopus pubmed and cochrane reviews,academic
themes were identified from 112 articles and related to environmental causes of perturbations in menarche either early or late disease causes and consequences of perturbations and social causes and consequences,academic
research from climatology was incorporated to describe how climate change events including increased hurricanes avalanches mudslides landslides and extreme weather events could alter the age of menarche by disrupting food availability or via increased toxin pollutant release,academic
overall our review revealed that these perturbations in the timing of menarche are likely to increase the disease burden for women in four key areas mental health fertility related conditions cardiovascular disease and bone health,academic
in summary the climate does have the potential to impact women s health through perturbation in the timing of menarche and this in turn will affect women s risk of disease in future,academic
climate change is driven primarily by humanity s use of fossil fuels and the resultant greenhouse gases from their combustion,academic
the effects of climate change on human health are myriad and becomingly increasingly severe as the pace of climate change accelerates,academic
one relatively underreported intersection between health and climate change is that of infections particularly antibiotic resistant infections,academic
in this perspective review the aspects of climate change that have already will and could possibly impact the proliferation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance are discussed,academic
the question of whether how and to what extent climate change is affecting health is central to many climate and health studies,academic
we describe a set of formal methods termed detection and attribution used by climatologists to determine whether a climate trend or extreme event has changed and to estimate the extent to which climate change influenced that change,academic
we discuss events where changing weather patterns were attributed to climate change and extend these analyses to include health impacts from heat waves in 2018 and 2019 in europe and japan and we show how such impact attribution could be applied to melting ice roads in the arctic,academic
documenting the causal chain from emissions of greenhouse gases to observed human health outcomes is important input into risk assessments that prioritize health system preparedness and response interventions and into financial investments and communication about potential risk to policy makers and to the public,academic
abbreviations aap american academy of pediatrics sdoh social determinant of health social determinants of health sdohs defined as the social circumstances in which people are born grow live work and play profoundly affect children s health and drive health disparities,academic
1 sdohs are shaped by the distribution of money power and resources at global national and local levels,academic
the list of potential sdohs is expansive and includes food insecurity housing instability violence exposure structural racism poverty and immigration related stressors,academic
addressing sdohs within the pediatric medical home has garnered considerable interest lately as a potential solution to both improving health across the life course and mitigating health care costs,academic
1 however one critical determinant is missing from the pediatric community s definition of sdohs climate change,academic
climate change also called global warming is arguably one of the greatest public health threats of our time,academic
climate change is caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions from human activity resulting in higher global average temperatures and changes to environmental and human systems,academic
the american academy of pediatrics aap issued a policy statement in 2007 revised in 2015 encouraging pediatricians to reduce carbon emissions and support families experiencing the effects of climate change,academic
2 we agree with this call to action,academic
however given the current national focus of policymakers funders and health care systems on addressing sdohs along with the ubiquitous impact of the changing climate on the social and environmental circumstances in which children live we recommend climate address correspondence to maya i,academic

significance the food system is responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions while unhealthy diets and high body weight are among the greatest contributors to premature mortality,academic
our study provides a comparative analysis of the health and climate change benefits of global dietary changes for all major world regions,academic
we project that health and climate change benefits will both be greater the lower the fraction of animal sourced foods in our diets,academic
three quarters of all benefits occur in developing countries although the per capita impacts of dietary change would be greatest in developed countries,academic
the monetized value of health improvements could be comparable with and possibly larger than the environmental benefits of the avoided damages from climate change,academic
what we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment we all share,academic
recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal sourced foods in our diets,academic
here we couple for the first time to our knowledge a region specific global health model based on dietary and weight related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes,academic
we find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant based diets vary greatly among regions,academic
the largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas western high income and middle income countries gain most in per capita terms,academic
transitioning toward more plant based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6 10 and food related greenhouse gas emissions by 29 70 compared with a reference scenario in 2050,academic
we find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with or exceed the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts,academic
overall we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1 31 trillion us dollars which is equivalent to 0,academic
4 13 of global gross domestic product gdp in 2050,academic
however significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here,academic
two of the most pressing issues of our time climate change and health are addressed with exceptional scholarship and clarity in this new volume edited by prof colin d butler of the faculty of health at the university of canberra australia,academic
unusual for a multi author book where disciplinary diversity is required is its coherence and evidential thoroughness,academic
this is no small tribute to the broad grasp of the complex science tackled and marshalled by the editor and his advisors,academic
the legacy that the late prof aj tony mcmichael pioneer of climate change and health epidemiology provides the book in one of its chapters and through the contributions of his successors is plainly evident,academic
he progressed the notion that the present geological epoch as anthropocene one where human enterprise began to match the forces of nature crutzen in 2004 and steffen in 2007 is of major health relevance,academic
indeed as steffen asserts in the present volume it is now possible that on this account the earth may enter an irreversible warmer era with all if its dire consequences,academic
in the meantime the authors adduce the primary secondary and tertiary health effects already underway in various regions,academic
the biomedical psychosocial and environmental health threats we face are cogently elaborated,academic
what of food and health,academic
throughout the publication we are caused to think how closely food and health security move together,academic
the ecological basis of health is undergoing a momentous natural experiment which must be recognised and acted upon through population resource ad conflict management in order to survive long enough for sufficient planetary recovery to occur,academic
this is a book with content for all food nutritional and health professionals to assimilate,academic
despite calls for including content on climate change and its effect on health in curricula across the spectrum of medical education no widely used resource exists to guide residency training programs in this effort,academic
this lack of resources poses challenges for training program leaders seeking to incorporate evidence based climate and health content into their curricula,academic
climate change increases risks of heat related illness infections asthma mental health disorders poor perinatal outcomes adverse experiences from trauma and displacement and other harms,academic
more numerous and increasingly dangerous natural disasters caused by climate change impair delivery of care by disrupting supply chains and compromising power supplies,academic
graduating trainees face a knowledge gap in understanding managing and mitigating these many faceted consequences of climate change which expected to intensify in coming decades will influence both the health of their patients and the health care they deliver,academic
in this article the authors propose a framework of climate change and health educational content for residents including how climate change 1 harms health 2 necessitates adaptation in clinical practice and 3 undermines health care delivery,academic
the authors propose not only learning objectives linked to the accreditation council for graduate medical education core competencies for resident education but also learning formats and assessment strategies in each content area,academic
they also present opportunities for implementation of climate and health education in residency training programs,academic
including this content in residency education will better prepare doctors to deliver anticipatory guidance to at risk patients manage those experiencing climate related health effects and reduce care disruptions during climate driven extreme weather events,academic
climate change is increasing risks to human health and to the health systems that seek to protect the safety and well being of populations,academic
health authorities require information about current associations between health outcomes and weather or climate vulnerable populations projections of future risks and adaptation opportunities in order to reduce exposures empower individuals to take needed protective actions and build climate resilient health systems,academic
an increasing number of health authorities from local to national levels seek this information by conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments,academic
while assessments can provide valuable information to plan for climate change impacts the results of many studies are not helping to build the global evidence base of knowledge in this area,academic
they are also often not integrated into adaptation decision making sometimes because the health sector is not involved in climate change policy making processes at the national level,academic
significant barriers related to data accessibility a limited number of climate and health models uncertainty in climate projections and a lack of funding and expertise particularly in developing countries challenge health authority efforts to conduct rigorous assessments and apply the findings,academic
this paper examines the evolution of climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments including guidance developed for such projects the number of assessments that have been conducted globally and implementation of the findings to support health adaptation action,academic
greater capacity building that facilitates assessments from local to national scales will support collaborative efforts to protect health from current climate hazards and future climate change,academic
health sector officials will benefit from additional resources and partnership opportunities to ensure that evidence about climate change impacts on health is effectively translated into needed actions to build health resilience,academic
national and international assessments have drawn attention to the substantial economic risks of climate change,academic
the costs of climate sensitive health outcomes responsive to meteorological or seasonal patterns are among the least studied of those risks,academic
in this article we describe how cost valuation analyses that relate climate sensitive health outcomes to damages in economic terms can illuminate the costs of inaction on the climate crisis and the economic savings of addressing this problem,academic
we identify major challenges to expanding the application of climate health valuation research and suggest solutions to overcome these obstacles to better characterize the burden of climate sensitive health outcomes and health disparities,academic
the projected health and economic harms of climate sensitive risks could be enormous if climate change continues to accelerate and communities are not prepared to reduce or prevent their impact,academic
expanded valuation of climate sensitive health outcomes can inform policies that slow climate change and promote stronger investments in health protective climate change adaptation efforts,academic
climate change is an emerging and growing field of practice for the international public health community,academic
as practitioners researchers and policy makers grapple with the local health impacts of climate change there is an increasing need to clarify key terminology to support public health actors engage and respond in ways that promote intersectoral collaboration,academic
this contribution introduces the public health discourse on climate change with a particular focus on its implications for health equity,academic
after defining key terms and existing adaptation practices climate justice and assets oriented inquiry into the intersectional determinants of health are discussed as future opportunities for addressing health equity in climate and health related research and practice,academic
significance more intense extreme events are projected under future climate change,academic
however the impacts of climate extremes on future air quality and associated health implications are not well recognized and are rarely quantified in china with an enormous health burden from air pollution,academic
here we estimate the climate driven air pollution mortality in china and find that future climate change is likely to exacerbate air pollution mortality largely influenced by the more intense extreme events such as stagnation events and heat waves,academic
our analysis provides quantitative assessments and insights regarding the links between climate extremes future air quality and public health suggesting that extreme weather events may be an important mechanism by which climate change will affect air quality and especially fine particulate matter,academic
in recent years air pollution has caused more than 1 million deaths per year in china making it a major focus of public health efforts,academic
however future climate change may exacerbate such human health impacts by increasing the frequency and duration of weather conditions that enhance air pollution exposure,academic
here we use a combination of climate air quality and epidemiological models to assess future air pollution deaths in a changing climate under representative concentration pathway 4,academic
we find that assuming pollution emissions and population are held constant at current levels climate change would adversely affect future air quality for 85 of china s population 55 of land area by the middle of the century and would increase by 3 and 4 the population weighted average concentrations of fine particulate matter pm2,academic
5 and ozone respectively,academic
as a result we estimate an additional 12 100 and 8 900 chinese 95 confidence interval 10 300 to 13 800 and 2 300 to 14 700 respectively will die per year from pm2,academic
5 and ozone exposure respectively,academic
the important underlying climate mechanisms are changes in extreme conditions such as atmospheric stagnation and heat waves contributing 39 and 6 respectively to the increase in mortality,academic
additionally greater vulnerability of china s aging population will further increase the estimated deaths from pm2,academic
5 and ozone in 2050 by factors of 1 and 3 respectively,academic
our results indicate that climate change and more intense extremes are likely to increase the risk of severe pollution events in china,academic
managing air quality in china in a changing climate will thus become more challenging,academic
backgroundglobally the response to climate change is gradually gaining momentum as the impacts of climate change unfold,academic
in south africa it is increasingly apparent that delays in responding to climate change over the past decades have jeopardized human life and livelihoods,academic
while slow progress with mitigation especially in the energy sector has garnered much attention focus is now shifting to developing plans and systems to adapt to the impacts of climate change,academic
methodswe applied systematic review methods to assess progress with climate change adaptation in the health sector in south africa,academic
this case study provides useful lessons which could be applied in other countries in the african region or globally,academic
we reviewed the literature indexed in pubmed and web of science together with relevant grey literature,academic
we included articles describing adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in south africa,academic
all study designs were eligible,academic
data from included articles and grey literature were summed thematically,academic
resultsof the 820 publications screened 21 were included together with an additional xx papers,academic
very few studies presented findings of an intervention or used high quality research designs,academic
several policy frameworks for climate change have been developed at national and local government levels,academic
these however pay little attention to health concerns and the specific needs of vulnerable groups,academic
systems for forecasting extreme weather and tracking malaria and other infections appear well established,academic
yet there is little evidence about the country s preparedness for extreme weather events or the ability of the already strained health system to respond to these events,academic
seemingly few adaptation measures have taken place in occupational and other settings,academic
to date little attention has been given to climate change in training curricula for health workers,academic
conclusionsoverall the volume and quality of research is disappointing and disproportionate to the threat posed by climate change in south africa,academic
this is surprising given that the requisite expertise for policy advocacy identifying effective interventions and implementing systems based approaches rests within the health sector,academic
more effective use of data a traditional strength of health professionals could support adaptation and promote accountability of the state,academic
with increased health sector leadership climate change could be reframed as predominately a health issue one necessitating an urgent adequately resourced response,academic
such a shift in south africa but also beyond the country may play a key role in accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation,academic
policy action in the coming decade will be crucial to achieving globally agreed upon goals to decarbonize the economy and build resilience to a warmer more extreme climate,academic
public health has an essential role in climate planning and action co benefits to health help underpin greenhouse gas reduction strategies while safeguarding health particularly of the most vulnerable is a frontline local adaptation goal,academic
using the structure of the core functions and essential services cfes we reviewed the literature documenting the evolution of public health s role in climate change action since the 2009 launch of the us cdc climate and health program,academic
we found that the public health response to climate change has been promising in the area of assessment monitoring climate hazards diagnosing health status assessing vulnerability mixed in the area of policy development mobilizing partnerships mitigation and adaptation activities and relatively weak in assurance communication workforce development and evaluation,academic
we suggest that the cfes model remains important but is not aligned with three concepts governance implementation and adjustment that have taken on increasing importance,academic
adding these concepts to the model can help ensure that public health fulfills its potential as a proactive partner fully integrated into climate policy planning and action in the coming decade,academic
background the world health organization emphasized that climate change is a significant and emerging threat to public health especially in lower income populations and tropical subtropical countries,academic
however people in asia and africa were the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat,academic
in vietnam little research has been conducted concerning the perceptions of effects of climate change on human health,academic
objective the aim of this study was to explore the perceptions on climate change and its impact on human health among people in hanoi,academic
design we applied a combined quantitative and qualitative approach to study perceptions on climate change among people in hanoi,academic
a total of 1 444 people were recruited including 754 people living in non slum areas and 690 people living in slum areas of hanoi,academic
a structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data on their perceptions,academic
in a parallel qualitative study two focus group discussions and 12 in depth interviews ids were carried out involving 24 people from both slum and non slum areas,academic
results the majority of the respondents in the study had heard about climate change and its impact on human health 79,academic
3 and 70,academic
1 in non slum and slum areas respectively,academic
about one third of the respondents reported that members of their family had experienced illness in the recent summer and winter compared to the same seasons 5 years ago,academic
the most common symptoms reported during hot weather were headaches fatigue and dizziness hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases were also reported,academic
during cold weather people reported experiencing cough fever and influenza as well as pneumonia and emerging infectious diseases such as dengue and japanese encephalitis,academic
conclusions the observed high level of awareness on the links between climate change and human health may help to increase the success of the national prevention program on climate change,academic
moreover understanding the concerns of the people may help policy makers to develop and implement effective and sustainable adaptation measures for hanoi city as well as for vietnam as a whole,academic
the environmental effects assessment panel of the montreal protocol under the united nations environment programme evaluates effects on the environment and human health that arise from changes in the stratospheric ozone layer and concomitant variations in ultraviolet uv radiation at the earth s surface,academic
the current update is based on scientific advances that have accumulated since our last assessment photochem and photobiol sci 20 1 1 67 2021,academic
we also discuss how climate change affects stratospheric ozone depletion and ultraviolet radiation and how stratospheric ozone depletion affects climate change,academic
the resulting interlinking effects of stratospheric ozone depletion uv radiation and climate change are assessed in terms of air quality carbon sinks ecosystems human health and natural and synthetic materials,academic
we further highlight potential impacts on the biosphere from extreme climate events that are occurring with increasing frequency as a consequence of climate change,academic
these and other interactive effects are examined with respect to the benefits that the montreal protocol and its amendments are providing to life on earth by controlling the production of various substances that contribute to both stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change,academic
coastal areas have been increasingly affected by human activities marine pollution and climate change are among the most important pressures affecting these environments,academic
human induced pressures occur in a cumulative way and generate additive antagonistic or synergistic effects,academic
knowledge on synergistic effects is crucial to coastal zone management since they may imply a change in human uses of these systems as well as dedicated action plans in order to reduce hazards and environmental risks,academic
in this work we provide an overview of the available literature on synergistic effects between climate change and chemical pollution and discuss current knowledge methodological approaches and research gaps and needs,academic
interactions between these two pressures may be climate change dominant climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure or toxicity or contaminant dominant chemical exposure leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility but the mechanistic drivers of such processes are not well known,academic
results from a few meta analyses studies and reviews showed that synergistic interactions tend to be more frequent compared to additive and antagonistic ones,academic
however most of the studies are individual based and assess the cumulative effects of a few contaminants individually in laboratory settings together with few climate variables particularly temperature and ph,academic
nevertheless a wide diversity of contaminants have already been individually tested spanning from metals persistent organic pollutants and more recently emergent pollutants,academic
population and community based approaches are less frequent but have generated very interesting and more holistic perspectives,academic
methodological approaches are quite diverse from laboratory studies to mesocosm and field studies or based on statistical or modelling tools each with their own potential and limitations,academic
more holistic comparisons integrating several pressures and their combinations and a multitude of habitats taxa life stages among others are needed as well as insights from meta analyses and systematic reviews,academic
human induced climate change with such rapid and continuing global scale warming is historically unprecedented and signifies that human pressures on earth s life supporting natural systems now exceed the planet s bio geo capacity,academic
the risks from climate change to health and survival in populations are diverse as are the social and political ramifications,academic
although attributing observed health changes in a population to the recent climatic change is difficult a coherent pattern of climate and weather associated changes is now evident in many regions of the world,academic
the risks impinge unevenly especially on poorer and vulnerable regions and are amplified by pre existing high rates of climate sensitive diseases and conditions,academic
if as now appears likely the world warms by 3 5oc by 2100 the health consequences directly and via massive social and economic disruption will be severe,academic
the health sector has an important message to convey comparing the health risks and benefits of enlightened action to avert climate change and to achieve sustainable ways of living versus the self interested or complacent inaction,academic
background abundant historical evidence demonstrates how environmental changes can affect social stability and in turn human health,academic
a rapidly growing body of literature largely from political science and economics is examining the potential for and consequences associated with social instability related to current climate change,academic
however comparatively little of this research incorporates the effects on human health or the role of health systems in influencing the magnitude and types of instability that could occur,academic
objective the objective of this commentary is to articulate a conceptual framework incorporating health outcomes and health systems into theorized and observed linkages between climate change and social instability illustrating in particular the health effects of natural resource shortages infectious disease outbreaks and migration,academic
discussion although increasing evidence exists that climate change health and social instability are related key questions remain about the pathways linking these factors as well as the magnitude causality and directionality of relationships across spatial and temporal scales,academic
models seeking to explain and predict climate related social unrest should incorporate the many linkages between climate change human health and social instability,academic
members of the environmental health research community should work closely with those in the political science and economics communities to help deepen understandings of climate related stressors and shocks that affect instability and worsen health outcomes,academic
climate change a health emergency the effects of climate disruption are fundamentally health issues,academic
as physicians we have a special responsibility to safeguard health and alleviate suffering and individual actions are far from enough to address the challenge we collectively face,academic
the mja lancet countdown on health and climate change was established in 2017 and produced its first australian national assessment in 2018,academic
it examined 41 indicators across five broad domains climate change impacts exposures and vulnerability adaptation planning and resilience for health mitigation actions and health co benefits economics and finance and public and political engagement,academic
it found that overall australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health and that policy inaction in this regard threatens australian lives,academic
in this report we present the 2019 update,academic
we track progress on health and climate change in australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018,academic
a number of new indicators are introduced this year including one focused on wildfire exposure and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector,academic
several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year either due to their discontinuation by the parent project the lancet countdown or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator,academic
in a year marked by an australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country,academic
there has been progress in renewable energy generation including substantial employment increases in this sector,academic
there has also been some progress at state and local government level,academic
however there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the australian federal parliament and australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries for example it is one of the world s largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low,academic
we also find significantly increasing exposure of australians to heatwaves and in most states and territories continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures,academic
we conclude that australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this,academic
we examined two of humanity s present day challenges climate change and chronic diseases in relation to the co benefits that green spaces provide to human health and the environment,academic
the reduction of several chronic diseases and associated symptoms including anxiety obesity and cardiovascular disease has been associated with the presence of and access to green space,academic
green spaces also contribute to a number of environmental health benefits and have been shown to reduce the likelihood of flooding improve air quality and provide cooling and shade,academic
these co benefits address both the symptoms of several chronic diseases and associated risk factors along with the environmental and health impacts of climate change,academic
this article explores how to maximize the co benefits of green spaces through two examples of multi sectoral collaborations,academic
with these two examples we have provided a model of collective collaboration that aims to address complex issues such as climate change and chronic diseases through the common intervention of green spaces,academic
climate change is the defining global public health threat of the twenty first century whitmee et al,academic
2015 who 2018 watts et al,academic
2019 and has profound implications for nearly every aspect of health,academic
the ongoing covid 19 crisis is causing unprecedented disruptions to health systems but climate change will have even greater much greater consequences,academic
yet health policy and systems researchers largely continue to ignore and overlook climate change,academic
this is a critical oversight,academic
countries with the greatest vulnerability to climate change have the least developed health systems salas and jha 2019 and climate change will further compound and exacerbate existing inequalities costello et al,academic
health policy and systems research hpsr is well positioned to accelerate the needed response and transformation peters 2018,academic
hpsr could make countless contributions to address the climate challenge,academic
we highlight three interlinked reasons which should motivate the hpsr community to prioritize a focus on climate change,academic
first hpsr is crucial to understanding the impact and implications of climate change,academic
hpsr seeks to analyse how different actors interact in policy and implementation processes to improve health outcomes,academic
it draws on a blend of public health economics sociology anthropology political science and epidemiology and can serve as a multidisciplinary bridge to these various fields,academic
hpsr seeks to analyse how health systems respond and adapt to health policies and how health policies can shape and be shaped by health systems and broader determinants of health like climate change ahpsr 2007,academic
the interdisciplinary nature of hpsr makes it well positioned to tackle the complexity of climate change and can improve the analysis of linkages between health and climate,academic
until now the climate change and health literature have focused on infectious diseases hosking and campbell lendrum 2012 along with deaths and injuries from extreme weather events the adverse health effects of extreme heat hosking and campbell lendrum 2012 and risks of under nutrition due to declines in food yields friel et al,academic
2011 hosking and campbell lendrum 2012 xie et al,academic
these studies show how climate change affects health outcomes hpsr could augment ongoing efforts and widen this understanding by applying a systems approach,academic
there is an urgent need to take a broader health systems and health policies perspective this is the role of the hpsr community,academic
researchers can help policymakers appreciate anticipate and work to prevent the effects of climate change on human health and well being,academic
for example most efforts to achieve primary health care phc do not sufficiently consider the implications of the climate crisis kadandale et al,academic
there is a need to revise the discourse policy and practice on efforts to achieve phc but also universal health coverage to include explicit consideration of climate change and its health effects,academic
second hpsr is essential to developing and designing both climate change mitigation and adaptation policies within the health sector,academic
it can also help policymakers appreciate how to implement these policies,academic
the emergent literature on health systems and climate change considers adaptation mayhew and hanefeld 2014 but there is comparatively limited work on mitigation though these will vary by context with mitigation policies needed urgently in highincome high emitting countries and adaptation policies needed in countries with relatively fewer emissions both approaches are crucial,academic
a 2019 world health organization who survey found that knowledge of the health implications of climate change is shaping policymaking however additional financial or human resources are not being allocated to meet the challenge who 2019,academic
adequate financial resources including from climate change funding sources have not shifted to health budgets,academic
for example the same survey identified financing as one the main barriers with only 9 of national adaptation plans for health h nap being fully resourced who 2019,academic
addressing this requires strengthening health policymakers health workers and health institutions capacities to adapt to and,academic
abstract health systems and infrastructure have been suggested to be overwhelmed by the large scale public health risks from climate change,academic
with weak health systems the impact is estimated to be far greater in developing countries which are already over burdened with poor health outcomes,academic
yet there is limited knowledge about the preparedness and capacities of health institutions and professionals in developing countries to respond to climate change health risks,academic
drawing from the world health organization s framework on health system capacities effective response and emergency preparedness and using mixed methods research design we examined capacities and preparedness of public health professionals in ghana to manage climate change health risks and emergencies,academic
qualitative interviews n 20 and quantitative surveys n 99 were conducted with health professionals in savelugu nanton and ada east districts in ghana,academic
the study found that capacity and preparedness of health professionals and institutions to respond to climate change related health emergencies were weak in the study districts,academic
based on our findings we recommend the development and implementation of a comprehensive policy on climate change and health to build capacities of health institutions and professionals improve climate change health research and increase funding to climate change programmes and activities in local communities,academic
reliable estimates of future health impacts due to climate change are needed to inform and contribute to the design of efficient adaptation and mitigation strategies,academic
however projecting health burdens associated to specific environmental stressors is a challenging task because of the complex risk patterns and inherent uncertainty of future climate scenarios,academic
these assessments involve multidisciplinary knowledge requiring expertise in epidemiology statistics and climate science among other subjects,academic
here we present a methodologic framework to estimate future health impacts under climate change scenarios based on a defined set of assumptions and advanced statistical techniques developed in time series analysis in environmental epidemiology,academic
the proposed methodology is illustrated through a step by step hands on tutorial structured in well defined sections that cover the main methodological steps and essential elements,academic
each section provides a thorough description of each step along with a discussion on available analytical options and the rationale on the choices made in the proposed framework,academic
the illustration is complemented with a practical example of study using real world data and a series of r scripts included as supplementary digital content http links,academic
com ede b504 which facilitates its replication and extension on other environmental stressors outcomes study settings and projection scenarios,academic
users should critically assess the potential modeling alternatives and modify the framework and r code to adapt them to their research on health impact projections,academic
climate change is known to affect pacific island nations in a variety of ways,academic
one of them is by increasing the vulnerability of human health induced by various climate change impacts which pose an additional burden to the already distressed health systems in the region,academic
this paper explores the associations between climate change and human health on the one hand and outlines some of the health care challenges posed by a changing climate on the other,academic
in particular it describes the links between climate variations and the emergence of climate sensitive infectious diseases such as the mosquito borne diseases dengue chikungunya and zika,academic
the paper also presents a summary of the key findings of the research initiatives climate change and prevalence study of zika virus diseases in fiji and the findings from the world mosquito program as two examples of public health action in the pacific region,academic
climate change worry involves primarily verbal linguistic thoughts about the changes that may occur in the climate system and the possible effects of these changes,academic
such worry is one of several possible psychological responses e,academic
fear anxiety depression and trauma to climate change,academic
within this article the psychometric development of the ten item climate change worry scale ccws is detailed in three studies,academic
the scale was developed to assess proximal worry about climate change rather than social or global impacts,academic
study 1 provided evidence that the ccws items were internally consistent constituted a single factor and that the facture structure of the items was invariant for men and women,academic
the results from study 1 also indicated a good fit with a rasch model of the items,academic
study 2 affirmed the internal consistency of the ccws items and indicated that peoples responses to the measure were temporally stable over a two week test retest interval r 0,academic
study 3 provided support for the convergent and divergent validity of the ccws through its pattern of correlations with several established clinical and weather related measures,academic
the limitations of the studies and the possible uses of the ccws were discussed,academic
the current work represents a starting point,academic
this study aimed to measure the knowledge and perceptions of medical public health and nursing students about climate change and its impacts and to identify associations between the knowledge and perceptions,academic
data were from a nationwide cross sectional survey of 1387 students sampled in five different regional universities in china april may 2017,academic
the knowledge and perceptions of the participants were collected by self administered questionnaires,academic
we found that most respondents believed that climate change is generally bad 83 and bad for human health 88 while 67 believed that climate change is controllable,academic
the vast majority of respondents acknowledged illness conditions resulting from poor air quality 95 heat stress 93 and extreme weather events 91 as potential impacts of climate change,academic
nevertheless only 39 recognized malnutrition as a consequence of food deprivation resulting from climate change,academic
around 58 of respondents could correctly identify the causes of climate change,academic
the knowledge of the causes of climate change was not associated with the ability to recognize the health consequences of climate change,academic
however the knowledge of causes of climate change was a significant predictor of increased awareness of the negative impacts of climate change between the medical and nursing students although this was not the case among their public health counterparts,academic
poor knowledge about the causes of climate change is evident among students in china,academic
they are able to recognize the direct links between weather events and health but less likely to understand the consequences involving complicated pathways,academic
research and training into the underlying mechanisms of health impacts of climate change needs to be strengthened,academic
climate change poses a range of current and future health risks that health professionals need to understand track and manage,academic
however conventional monitoring and evaluation m e as practiced in the health sector including the use of indicators does not adequately serve this purpose,academic
improved indicators are needed in three broad categories 1 vulnerability and exposure to climate related hazards 2 current impacts and projected risks and 3 adaptation processes and health system resilience,academic
these indicators are needed at the population level and at the health systems level including clinical care and public health,academic
selected indicators must be sensitive valid and useful,academic
and they must account for uncertainties about the magnitude and pattern of climate change the broad range of upstream drivers of climate sensitive health outcomes and the complexities of adaptation itself including institutional learning and knowledge management to inform iterative risk management,academic
barriers and constraints to implementing such indicators must be addressed and lessons learned need to be added to the evidence base,academic
this paper describes an approach to climate and health indicators including characteristics of the indicators implementation and research needs,academic
climate is one of many factors with the potential to alter disease states and is expected to exert an overwhelming negative effect on the health of humans and animals rabinowitz and conti 2013,academic
in addition several studies suggested that the increase of temperature might reduce mortality and or improve health and welfare related aspects in humans and livestock living in geographic areas with cold winters ballester et al,academic

climate change is increasing risks to the mental health of canadians,academic
impacts from a changing climate may outstrip the ability of canadians and their health sustaining institutions to adapt effectively and could increase poor mental health outcomes particularly amongst those most marginalized in society,academic
a scoping review of literature published during 2000 2017 explored risks impacts and vulnerabilities related to climate change and mental health,academic
in this commentary the authors present a new assessment of evidence from this scoping review and highlight factors that influence the capacity to adapt to the mental health consequences of a changing climate,academic
findings from this assessment reveal eleven key factors that influence the capacity to adapt social capital sense of community government assistance access to resources community preparedness intersectoral transdisciplinary collaboration vulnerability and adaptation assessments communication and outreach mental health literacy and culturally relevant resources,academic
attention to these factors by canadian decision makers can support proactive and effective management of the mental health consequences of climate change,academic
backgroundthe adverse health impacts of climate change are increasing on a global level,academic
however knowledge about climate change and health is still unavailable to many global citizens in particular on adaptation measures and co benefits of health mitigation,academic
educational technologies such as massive open online courses moocs may have a high potential for providing access to information about climate change links to health for a global audience,academic
main bodywe developed three moocs addressing the link between climate change and health to take advantage of the methodology s broad reach and accelerate knowledge dissemination on the nexus of climate change and health,academic
the primary objective was to translate an existing face to face short course that only reached a few participants on climate change and health into globally accessible learning opportunities,academic
in the following we share and comment on our lessons learned with the three moocs with a focus on global teaching in the realm of climate change and health,academic
conclusionsoverall the three moocs attracted a global audience with diverse educational backgrounds and a large number of participants from low income countries,academic
our experience highlights that moocs may play a part in global capacity building potentially for other health related topics as well as we have found that our moocs have attracted participants within low resource contexts,academic
moocs may be an effective method for teaching and training global students on health topics in this case on the complex links and dynamics between climate change and health and may further act as an enabler for equitable access to quality education,academic
assessment of spatial and temporal variation in the impacts of ozone on human health vegetation and climate requires appropriate metrics,academic
a key component of the tropospheric ozone assessment report toar is the consistent calculation of these metrics at thousands of monitoring sites globally,academic
investigating temporal trends in these metrics required that the same statistical methods be applied across these ozone monitoring sites,academic
the nonparametric mann kendall test for significant trends and the theil sen estimator for estimating the magnitude of trend were selected to provide robust methods across all sites,academic
this paper provides the scientific underpinnings necessary to better understand the implications of and rationale for selecting a specific toar metric for assessing spatial and temporal variation in ozone for a particular impact,academic
the rationale and underlying research evidence that influence the derivation of specific metrics are given,academic
the form of 25 metrics 4 for model measurement comparison 5 for characterization of ozone in the free troposphere 11 for human health impacts and 5 for vegetation impacts are described,academic
finally this study categorizes health and vegetation exposure metrics based on the extent to which they are determined only by the highest hourly ozone levels or by a wider range of values,academic
the magnitude of the metrics is influenced by both the distribution of hourly average ozone concentrations at a site location and the extent to which a particular metric is determined by relatively low moderate and high hourly ozone levels,academic
hence for the same ozone time series changes in the distribution of ozone concentrations can result in different changes in the magnitude and direction of trends for different metrics,academic
thus dissimilar conclusions about the effect of changes in the drivers of ozone variability e,academic
precursor emissions on health and vegetation exposure can result from the selection of different metrics,academic
background anthropogenic global warming interacting with social and other environmental determinants constitutes a profound health risk,academic
this paper reports a comprehensive literature review for 1989 2013 inclusive the first 25 years in which this topic appeared in scientific journals,academic
it explores the extent to which articles have identified potentially catastrophic civilization endangering health risks associated with climate change,academic
methods pubmed and google scholar were primarily used to identify articles which were then ranked on a three point scale,academic
each score reflected the extent to which papers discussed global systemic risk,academic
citations were also analyzed,academic
results of 2143 analyzed papers 1546 72 were scored as one,academic
their citations 165 133 were 82 of the total,academic
the proportion of annual papers scored as three was initially high as were their citations but declined to almost zero by 1996 before rising slightly from 2006,academic
conclusions the enormous expansion of the literature appropriately reflects increased understanding of the importance of climate change to global health,academic
however recognition of the most severe existential health risks from climate change was generally low,academic
most papers instead focused on infectious diseases direct heat effects and other disciplinary bounded phenomena and consequences even though scientific advances have long called for more inter disciplinary collaboration,academic
abstract ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries experiencing drought and floods as a result of climate variability and change,academic
climate change in the form of higher temperature reduced rainfall and increased rainfall variability reduces crop yield and threatens food security in low income and agriculture based economies,academic
this study reviews impact of climate change and variability and climate change adaptation strategies employed at farm level in response to perceived changes in temperature and precipitation,academic
climate change negatively affects agriculture nutrition ground water availability soil organic matter and soil quality health conditions growth and poverty,academic
the survey reveals that ethiopian farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change,academic
these strategies include use of improved crop varieties agroforestry practices crop diversification soil conservation practices tree planting off farm activities irrigation practices adjusting planting dates selling of assets food aid and permanent and temporary migration in search of employment are the most important adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers,academic
however level of education gender age wealth of the head of household access to extension and credit information and climate social capital agroecological settings and temperature all influence farmer s choices lack of information on adaptation methods financial constraints and lack of access to land as main barriers to adapt climate change and variability,academic
another investigator also revealed that farmers living in the dry lowland area perceived more change in climate than farmers in the wet lowland area,academic
climate change impacts on the canadian food system pose risks to human health,academic
little attention has been paid to the climate change food security and human health nexus resulting in a number of knowledge gaps regarding food system components that are most vulnerable to climate change,academic
the lack of understanding of key dynamics and possible future impacts challenges the ability of public health officials and partners in other sectors to prepare canadians for future health risks,academic
a series of literature reviews were conducted to establish the relationship between climate change food security and human health and to identify vulnerabilities within the canadian food system,academic
evidence suggests that key activities within the food system are vulnerable to climate change,academic
the pathways in which climate change impacts travel through the food system and affect the critical dimensions of food security to influence human health outcomes are complex,academic
climate related disruptions in the food system can indirectly impact human health by diminishing food security which is a key determinant of health,academic
human health may also be directly affected by the physical effects of climate change on the food system primarily related to the impacts on nutrition and foodborne illnesses,academic
in this study we propose a novel analytical framework to study and respond to the climate change food security and human health nexus,academic
this work is intended to help public health officials researchers and relevant stakeholders investigate and understand current and future risks and inform adaptation efforts to protect the health of canadians,academic
climate change and climate sensitive disasters significantly impact health,academic
linking disaster risk reduction drr and climate change adaptation cca is essential for addressing these ever present complex and increasing risks,academic
recent calls have been made to build these links in health,academic
however there is a need to clearly articulate why linking drr and cca is important in health,academic
furthermore little is known about how drr and cca should be linked in health,academic
by extensively examining relevant literature this review presents the current state of knowledge of linking drr and cca in health,academic
this includes the potential for maximising conceptual synergies such as building resilience and reducing vulnerability and risk,academic
additionally technical and operational synergies are identified to link drr and cca in health including policy early warning systems vulnerability and risk assessment health systems strengthening infrastructure resilience disaster preparedness and response and health impact pathways,academic
public health actors have a central role in building these links due to their expertise work functions and experience in addressing complex health risks,academic
the review concludes with recommendations for future research including how to better link drr and cca in health and the opportunities challenges and enablers to build and sustain these links,academic
current day youth have an important role in climate activism as the decisions and policies made now will have long lasting impacts on the climate and sustainability,academic
climate change is becoming an increasing concern for younger generations,academic
as such the purpose of this study was to describe content related to climate change on tiktok,academic
this study included 100 english language videos related to climate change featured on tiktok,academic
the hashtag climatechange was chosen because it had the most views of any related hashtag at the time of the study,academic
the number of views comments and likes were recorded for each video,academic
each video was also observed for the presence of predetermined content characteristics,academic
the 100 videos sampled collectively received 205 551 200 views 40 203 400 likes and 666 089 comments,academic
only eight of the 100 videos included information from a reputable source,academic
only three of the characteristics were featured in a majority 50 of the videos,academic
these were presents climate change as real 93 affected populations 76 and climate anxiety frustration 57,academic
videos mentioning natural disasters garnered 63 453 100 30,academic
87 views 14 245 200 35,academic
43 likes and 236 493 35,academic
in all 73 of the 100 videos mentioned at least one environmental impact,academic

social media platforms such as tiktok are important tools for understanding popular opinion regarding public health issues such as global climate change,academic
however the presence of credible professionals is essential on platforms such as tiktok to increase the chances that messaging is as comprehensive as time allows while also being scientifically sound,academic
climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities,academic
so far anthropogenic activities have caused about 1,academic
0 c of global warming above the pre industrial level and this is likely to reach 1,academic
5 c between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist,academic
in 2018 the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate,academic
5 million people were affected and economic losses amounted to 131,academic
7 billion of which storms floods wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93,academic
economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade which is quite alarming,academic
furthermore food water health ecosystem human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack,academic
in 2015 the paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 c by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1,academic
this article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement namely conventional mitigation negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering,academic
conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil based co2 emissions,academic
negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels,academic
finally geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures,academic
it is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the paris agreement therefore the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable,academic
while various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development biogenic based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately,academic
climate change impacts on human health span the trajectory of time past present and future,academic
the key finding from the working group ii fifth assessment report ar5 of the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc states that health impacts due to climate change have already occurred in the past are currently occurring and will continue to occur at least for the foreseeable future even with immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions 1,academic
according to the ipcc there has been increased heat related mortality and decreased cold related mortality in some regions as a result of warming box 1,academic
moreover local changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of some water borne illnesses and disease vectors,academic
impacts of climate related extremes include alteration of ecosystems disruption of food production and water supply damage to infrastructure and settlements morbidity and mortality and consequences for mental health and human well being 1,academic
objective to discuss the nature of climate change and both its immediate and long term effects on human respiratory health,academic
methods this review is based on information from a presentation of the american college of chest physicians course on occupational and environmental lung disease held in toronto canada june 2013,academic
it is supplemented by a pubmed search for climate change global warming respiratory tract diseases and respiratory health,academic
it is also supplemented by a search of web sites including the environmental protection agency national oceanic and atmospheric administration world meteorological association national snow and ice data center carbon dioxide information analysis center inter governmental panel on climate change and the world health organization,academic
results health effects of climate change include an increase in the prevalence of certain respiratory diseases exacerbations of chronic lung disease premature mortality allergic responses and declines in lung function,academic
conclusions climate change mediated by greenhouse gases causes adverse health effects to the most vulnerable patient populations the elderly children and those in distressed socioeconomic strata,academic
given its associated burden of disease climate change in south africa could be reframed as predominately a health issue one necessitating an urgent health sector response,academic
the growing impact of climate change has major implications for south africa especially for the numerous vulnerable groups in the country,academic
we systematically reviewed the literature by searching pubmed and web of science,academic
of the 820 papers screened 34 were identified that assessed the impacts of climate change on health in the country,academic
most papers covered effects of heat on health or on infectious diseases 20 34 59,academic
we found that extreme weather events are the most noticeable effects to date especially droughts in the western cape but rises in vector borne diseases are gaining prominence,academic
climate aberration is also linked in myriad ways with outbreaks of food and waterborne diseases and possibly with the recent listeria epidemic,academic
the potential impacts of climate change on mental health may compound the multiple social stressors that already beset the populace,academic
climate change heightens the pre existing vulnerabilities of women fishing communities rural subsistence farmers and those living in informal settlements,academic
further gender disparities eco migration and social disruptions may undermine the prevention but also treatment of hiv,academic
our findings suggest that focused research and effective use of surveillance data are required to monitor climate change s impacts traditional strengths of the country s health sector,academic
the health sector hitherto a fringe player should assume a greater leadership role in promoting policies that protect the public s health address inequities and advance the country s commitments to climate change accords,academic
vulnerability and adaptation assessments can provide valuable input to foster climate resilient health systems,academic
however these assessments often do not explore the potential health risks of climate change far outside the range of recent experience with extreme weather events and other climate related hazards,academic
climate and health stress tests are designed to increase the capacity of health systems and related sectors to manage potentially disruptive climate related shocks and stresses,academic
stress tests focus on hypothetical scenarios during which it would be difficult for the health system to maintain its essential function of providing services to protect population health,academic
the stress test explores approaches to effectively manage acute and chronic climate related events and conditions that could directly impact health systems and climate related events in non health sectors that can indirectly impact health outcomes and or health system function,academic
we provide detailed methods and guidance for conducting climate and health stress tests centering on three primary activities 1 preparing and scoping the stress test 2 successfully conducting the stress test and 3 communicating the results to key stakeholders to facilitate policy and programmatic reforms,academic
purposethis paper aims to investigate farmers vulnerability to climate change and variability in the northern region of ghana,academic
design methodology approachthe study assessed the vulnerability of male headed and female headed farming households to climate change and variability by using the livelihood vulnerability index lvi and tested for significant difference in their vulnerability levels by applying independent two sample student st test based on gender by using a sample of 210 smallholder farming households,academic
findingsthe results revealed a significant difference in the vulnerability levels of female headed and male headed farming households,academic
female headed households were more vulnerable to livelihood strategies socio demographic profile social networks water and food major components of the lvi whereas male headed households were more vulnerable to health,academic
the vulnerability indices revealed that female headed households were more sensitive to the impact of climate change and variability,academic
however female headed households have the least adaptive capacities,academic
in all female headed farming households are more vulnerable to climate change and variability than male headed farming households,academic
research limitations implicationsthe study recommends that female headed households should be given priority in both on going and new intervention projects in climate change and agriculture by empowering them through financial resource support to venture into other income generating activities,academic
this would enable them to diversify their sources of livelihoods to boost their resilience to climate change and variability,academic
originality valuethis is the first study that examined the gender dimension of vulnerability of smallholder farmers in ghana by using the livelihood vulnerability framework,academic
female subordination in northern region of ghana has been profound to warrant a study on gender dimension in relation to climate change and variability especially as it is a semi arid region with unpredictable climatic conditions,academic
this research revealed the comparative vulnerability of male and female headed households to climate change and variability,academic
climate change affects almost all aspects of human life including health,academic
this is particularly true in densely populated and low lying deltas such as bangladesh,academic
however the climate health nexus is a relatively poorly explored domain of research which is a cause for concern given the country s intrinsic vulnerability to climatic impacts,academic
the impact of climate change on human health and well being can be manifested through different pathways and can be categorized as being direct or indirect mediated through complex biophysical and social dynamics,academic
the direct effects of climate change that have been observed in bangladesh include morbidity and mortality due to heat stress cyclones floods droughts and other weather extremes at different spatio temporal scales,academic
the indirect effects adopt more complex routes which includes threatening food and water security due to salinity intrusion and spread of infectious diseases due to changes in vector and pathogen ecology,academic
social dynamics in bangladesh such as those related to gender roles poverty and power relations also influence how the effects of climate change are experienced by different segments of the society,academic
the government of bangladesh has a number of measures already in place efforts that have been complemented by local interventions,academic
evidence to take robust health policy decisions related to climate change is limited and scattered while there is a lack of multidisciplinary research efforts,academic
considering these limitations generating and summarizing scientific evidence is vital for informing a resilient health system against future public health concerns in climate vulnerable countries such as bangladesh and in other low income regions,academic
disasters and climate change have significant implications for human health worldwide,academic
both climate change and the climate sensitive hazards that result in disasters are discussed in terms of direct and indirect impacts on health,academic
a growing body of literature has argued for the need to link disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation,academic
however there is limited articulation of the commonalities between these health impacts,academic
understanding the shared risk pathways is an important starting point for developing joint strategies for adapting to and reducing health risks,academic
therefore this article discusses the common aspects of direct and indirect health risks of climate change and climate sensitive disasters,academic
based on this discussion a theoretical framework is presented for understanding these commonalities,academic
as such this article hopes to extend the current health impact frameworks and provide a platform for further research exploring opportunities for linked adaptation and risk reduction strategies,academic
climate change presents a challenge at multiple levels it challenges our cognitive abilities because the effect of the accumulation of emissions is difficult to understand,academic
climate change also challenges many people s worldview because any climate mitigation regime will have economic and political implications that are incompatible with libertarian ideals of unregulated free markets,academic
these political implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in which disinformation abounds thus compounding the challenges for climate communicators,academic
the existing literature on how to communicate climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several conclusions first providing information about climate change in particular explanations of why it occurs can enhance people s acceptance of science,academic
second highlighting the scientific consensus can be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public acceptance,academic
third culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful,academic
finally climate misinformation is best defanged through a process known as inoculation before it is encountered although debunking techniques can also be successful,academic
expected final online publication date for the annual review of public health volume 42 is april 2021,academic

this review commissioned by the research councils uk living with environmental change lwec programme concerns research on the impacts on health and social care systems in the united kingdom of extreme weather events under conditions of climate change,academic
extreme weather events considered include heatwaves coldwaves and flooding,academic
using a structured review method we consider evidence regarding the currently observed and anticipated future impacts of extreme weather on health and social care systems and the potential of preparedness and adaptation measures that may enhance resilience,academic
we highlight a number of general conclusions which are likely to be of international relevance although the review focussed on the situation in the uk,academic
extreme weather events impact the operation of health services through the effects on built social and institutional infrastructures which support health and health care and also because of changes in service demand as extreme weather impacts on human health,academic
strategic planning for extreme weather and impacts on the care system should be sensitive to within country variations,academic
adaptation will require changes to built infrastructure systems including transport and utilities as well as individual care facilities and also to institutional and social infrastructure supporting the health care system,academic
care sector organisations communities and individuals need to adapt their practices to improve resilience of health and health care to extreme weather,academic
preparedness and emergency response strategies call for action extending beyond the emergency response services to include health and social care providers more generally,academic
abstract climate change is acknowledged as being a crucial determinant of public health,academic
the united states is experiencing an increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters as a result of climate change activity influencing the ways federal state and local governments are addressing the growing issue,academic
individuals who are vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather namely the poor the elderly disabled children prisoners and substance abusers have experienced heightened levels of mental emotional and bodily stress due to natural disaster exposure,academic
researchers from a variety of disciplines public health social science and environmental studies in particular are examining how natural disasters are impacting mental and physical health functioning while noting the demographic factors leaving certain groups more susceptible to harm,academic
a systematic literature review was conducted on the past 12 years of research that examined natural disaster related experiences and psychological and physiological health outcomes on populations who are more vulnerable to adverse weather impacts,academic
it was found that the mental and physical health of marginalized populations during and after a natural disaster were elevated and or exacerbated by circumstances pertaining to the weather event and the lack of disaster response actions,academic
it was also found that fostering social capital is a way to combat stressors in disadvantaged communities,academic
it is imperative that clinicians and policy makers confront the issue of climate change and natural disasters developing relief efforts and preventative measures to secure the well being of underserved groups who may not have many resources at their disposal,academic
we are at a point in history marked by unprecedented changes in the environmental foundations of human health and well being,academic
at the same time the demands from human populations have never been greater with profound differences in how we engage with the natural environment,academic
by the middle of this century when climate change impacts are further increasing the united nations expects the global population to be approaching 10 billion,academic
in this chapter we provide a synthesis of published evidence of the complex and important relationships between elements of biodiversity health and climate change,academic
we draw primarily on reviews conducted in the past five years supplemented with evidence on additional themes,academic
we also develop a detailed case study example focused on urban climate climate change and biodiversity taken from the perspective of a large and representative conurbation,academic
the case study uses a body of existing published evidence together with new data and insights to demonstrate important pathways impacts and outcomes,academic
we end by identifying a set of research questions and stress the need for even more extensive multi disciplinary and multi sector approaches,academic
nevertheless despite the need for more knowledge it is already clear that more effective action could and should be taken,academic
recent studies have reported a variety of health consequences of climate change,academic
however the vulnerability of individuals and cities to climate change remains to be evaluated,academic
we project the excess cause age region and education specific mortality attributable to future high temperatures in 161 chinese districts counties using 28 global climate models gcms under two representative concentration pathways rcps,academic
to assess the influence of population ageing on the projection of future heat related mortality we further project the age specific effect estimates under five shared socioeconomic pathways ssps,academic
heat related excess mortality is projected to increase from 1,academic
9 95 eci 0,academic
3 in the 2010s to 2,academic
1 in the 2030 s and 5,academic
9 in the 2090 s under rcp8,academic
5 with corresponding relative changes of 0,academic
2 and 3,academic
the projected slopes are steeper in southern eastern central and northern china,academic
people with cardiorespiratory diseases females the elderly and those with low educational attainment could be more affected,academic
population ageing amplifies future heat related excess deaths 2,academic
3 to 5,academic
8 fold under different ssps particularly for the northeast region,academic
our findings can help guide public health responses to ameliorate the risk of climate change,academic
global warming is expected to increase mortality due to heat stress in many regions,academic
here the authors asses how mortality due to high temperatures changes in china changes for different demographic groups and show that heat related excess mortality is increasing under climate change a process that is strongly amplified by population ageing,academic
significance human caused climate change could impact respiratory health including asthma and allergies through temperature driven increases in airborne pollen but the long term continental pollen trends and role of climate change in pollen patterns are not well understood,academic
we measure pollen trends across north america from 1990 to 2018 and find increases in pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons,academic
we use an ensemble of climate models to test the role of climate change and find that it is the dominant driver of changes in pollen season length and a significant contributor to increasing pollen concentrations,academic
our results indicate that human caused climate change has already worsened north american pollen seasons and climate driven pollen trends are likely to further exacerbate respiratory health impacts in coming decades,academic
airborne pollen has major respiratory health impacts and anthropogenic climate change may increase pollen concentrations and extend pollen seasons,academic
while greenhouse and field studies indicate that pollen concentrations are correlated with temperature a formal detection and attribution of the role of anthropogenic climate change in continental pollen seasons is urgently needed,academic
here we use long term pollen data from 60 north american stations from 1990 to 2018 spanning 821 site years of data and earth system model simulations to quantify the role of human caused climate change in continental patterns in pollen concentrations,academic
we find widespread advances and lengthening of pollen seasons 20 d and increases in pollen concentrations 21 across north america which are strongly coupled to observed warming,academic
human forcing of the climate system contributed 50 interquartile range 19 84 of the trend in pollen seasons and 8 4 14 of the trend in pollen concentrations,academic
our results reveal that anthropogenic climate change has already exacerbated pollen seasons in the past three decades with attendant deleterious effects on respiratory health,academic
this article provides a synthesis of the forthcoming first order draft of the canadian government s national assessment on climate change rural and remote chapter highlighting key health concerns from the literature associated with climate change in rural and remote regions as well as existing and future adaptation strategies,academic
to support the health and wellbeing of those experiencing the negative effects of climate change and utilizing systematic search processes this synthesis article highlights the importance of considering the specific socio cultural economic and geographic elements and existing expertise of individuals and communities in rural and remote regions,academic
climate change is happening due to natural factors and human activities,academic
it expressively alters biodiversity agricultural production and food security,academic
mainly narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction,academic
accordingly concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60 80 of humans globally,academic
nevertheless the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally,academic
therefore the objectives of this review are to identify appraise and synthesize the link between climate change biodiversity and food security,academic
data climatic models emission migration and extinction scenarios and outputs from previous publications were used,academic
due to climate change distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11,academic
0 m and 16,academic
9 km per decade to higher latitudes,academic
accordingly extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios provide 21 23 with unlimited migration and 38 52 with no migration,academic
when an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype,academic
however phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long term effects of climate change,academic
furthermore climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain fed agriculture,academic
crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised,academic
accordingly agricultural yields in africa alone could be decline by more than 30 in 2050,academic
therefore solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution when protecting biodiversity is given priority,academic
therefore mitigating food waste compensating food insecure people conserving biodiversity effective use of genetic resources and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss and meet food security under climate change scenarios,academic
however achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies releasing high yielding stress resistant varieties developing climate resilient irrigation structures and agriculture,academic
therefore degraded land restoration land use changes use of bio energy sustainable forest management and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts,academic
a complex whole of economy issue such as climate change demands an interdisciplinary multi sectoral response,academic
however evidence suggests that human health has remained elusive in its influence on the development of ambitious climate change mitigation policies for many national governments despite a recognition that the combustion of fossil fuels results in pervasive short and long term health consequences,academic
we use insights from literature on the political economy of health and climate change the science policy interface and power in policy making to identify additional barriers to the meaningful incorporation of health co benefits into climate change mitigation policy development,academic
specifically we identify four key interrelated areas where barriers may exist in relation to health co benefits discourse efficiency vested interests and structural challenges,academic
with these insights in mind we argue that the current politico economic paradigm in which climate change is situated and the processes used to develop climate change mitigation policies do not adequately support accounting for health co benefits,academic
we present approaches for enhancing the role of health co benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies to ensure that health is embedded in the broader climate change agenda,academic
ambient heat exposure is a well known health hazard which reduces human performance and work capacity at heat levels already common in tropical and subtropical areas,academic
various health problems have been reported,academic
increasing heat exposure during the hottest seasons of each year is a key feature of global climate change,academic
heat exhaustion and reduced human performance are often overlooked in climate change health impact analysis,academic
later this century many among the four billion people who live in hot areas worldwide will experience significantly reduced work capacity owing to climate change,academic
in some areas 30 40 of annual daylight hours will become too hot for work to be carried out,academic
the social and economic impacts will be considerable with global gross domestic product gdp losses greater than 20 by 2100,academic
the analysis to date is piecemeal,academic
more analysis of climate change related occupational health impact assessments is greatly needed,academic
climate change affects the range of pathogens and temperatures to which populations are exposed,academic
this article reviews the nature of these changes and explores how efforts to mitigate climate change could be of value to the global community,academic
rapid detrimental climate change and environmental degradation pose real threats to the health environment social economic and technological wellbeing of society heset,academic
it has become even more imperative that the health workforce public health and medical healthcare as well as auxiliary and support workers be climate environment competent to fulfil their role in managing the environmental public health risks and impacts as climate and environment inevitably continue to change,academic
we developed a broad six domain competency framework consisting of 1 climate and environment sciences 2 drivers of climate change 3 evidence projections and assessments 4 iterative risk management 5 mitigation adaptation and health co benefits and 6 collective strategies harnessing international regional local agreements and frameworks,academic
the framework can be used by health medical trainers to design cross sectoral sub competencies and learning content for training health workers to function at local regional and global levels,academic
reaching maintaining and improving the different levels of competency the health workforce will be increasingly invaluable partners in intra as well as inter sectoral responses to climate and environmental risks and impacts,academic
purpose climate change is an emerging challenge linked to negative outcomes for the environment and human health,academic
since the 1960s there has been a growing recognition of the need to address climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions implicated in the warming of our planet,academic
there are also deleterious health outcomes linked to complex climate changes that are emerging in the 21st century,academic
this article addresses the social justice issues associated with climate change and human health and discussion of climate justice,academic
organizing construct discussion paper,academic
methods a literature search of electronic databases was conducted for articles texts and documents related to climate change climate justice and human health,academic
findings the literature suggests that those who contribute least to global warming are those who will disproportionately be affected by the negative health outcomes of climate change,academic
the concept of climate justice and the role of the mary robinson foundation climate justice are discussed within a framework of nursing s professional responsibility and the importance of social justice for the world s people,academic
the nursing profession must take a leadership role in engaging in policy and advocacy discussions in addressing the looming problems associated with climate change,academic
conclusions nursing organizations have adopted resolutions and engaged in leadership roles to address climate change at the local regional national and global level,academic
it is essential that nurses embrace concepts related to social justice and engage in the policy debate regarding the deleterious effects on human health related to global warming and climate change,academic
nursing s commitment to social justice offers an opportunity to offer significant global leadership in addressing the health implications related to climate change,academic
clinical relevance recognizing the negative impacts of climate change on well being and the underlying socioeconomic reasons for their disproportionate and inequitable distribution can expand and optimize the profession s role in education practice research and policy making efforts to address climate change,academic
abstract the world is fast becoming a global village due to the increasing daily requirement of energy by all population across the world while the earth in its form cannot change,academic
the need for energy and its related services to satisfy human social and economic development welfare and health is increasing,academic
returning to renewables to help mitigate climate change is an excellent approach which needs to be sustainable in order to meet energy demand of future generations,academic
the study reviewed the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources which includes energy security energy access social and economic development climate change mitigation and reduction of environmental and health impacts,academic
despite these opportunities there are challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources towards climate change mitigation,academic
these challenges include market failures lack of information access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment and our daily carbon footprint,academic
the study suggested some measures and policy recommendations which when considered would help achieve the goal of renewable energy thus to reduce emissions mitigate climate change and provide a clean environment as well as clean energy for all and future generations,academic
food production is affected by climate change and in turn food production is responsible for 20 30 of greenhouse gases,academic
the food system must increase output as the population increases and must meet nutrition and health needs while simultaneously assisting in achieving the sustainable development goals,academic
good nutrition is important for combatting infection reducing child mortality and controlling obesity and chronic disease throughout the life course,academic
dietary guidelines provide advice for a healthy diet and the main principles are now well established and compatible with sustainable development,academic
climate change will have a significant effect on food supply however with political commitment and substantial investment projected improvements will be sufficient to provide food for the healthy diets needed to achieve the sustainable development goals,academic
some changes will need to be made to food production nutrient content will need monitoring and more equitable distribution is required to meet the dietary guidelines,academic
increased breastfeeding rates will improve infant and adult health while helping to greenhouse gases,academic
expected final online publication date for the annual review of public health volume 42 is april 2021,academic

abstract neglected tropical diseases ntds are a diverse group of diseases that continue to affect 1 billion people with these diseases disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations and territories,academic
climate change is having an increasing impact on public health in tropical and subtropical areas and across the world and can affect disease distribution and transmission in potentially diverse ways,academic
improving our understanding of how climate change influences ntds can help identify populations at risk to include in future public health interventions,academic
articles were identified by searching electronic databases for reports of climate change and ntds between 1 january 2010 and 1 march 2020,academic
climate change may influence the emergence and re emergence of multiple ntds particularly those that involve a vector or intermediate host for transmission,academic
although specific predictions are conflicting depending on the geographic area the type of ntd and associated vectors and hosts it is anticipated that multiple ntds will have changes in their transmission period and geographic range and will likely encroach on regions and populations that have been previously unaffected,academic
there is a need for improved surveillance and monitoring to identify areas of ntd incursion and emergence and include these in future public health interventions,academic
this systematic review of reviews was conducted to examine housing precarity and homelessness in relation to climate change and weather extremes internationally,academic
in a thematic analysis of 15 reviews 5 systematic and 10 non systematic the following themes emerged risk factors for homelessness housing precarity temperature extremes health concerns structural factors natural disasters and housing,academic
first an increased risk of homelessness has been found for people who are vulnerably housed and populations in lower socio economic positions due to energy insecurity and climate change induced natural hazards,academic
second homeless vulnerably housed populations are disproportionately exposed to climatic events temperature extremes and natural disasters,academic
third the physical and mental health of homeless vulnerably housed populations is projected to be impacted by weather extremes and climate change,academic
fourth while green infrastructure may have positive effects for homeless vulnerably housed populations housing remains a major concern in urban environments,academic
finally structural changes must be implemented,academic
recommendations for addressing the impact of climate change on homelessness and housing precarity were generated including interventions focusing on homelessness housing precarity and reducing the effects of weather extremes improved housing and urban planning and further research on homelessness housing precarity and climate change,academic
to further enhance the impact of these initiatives we suggest employing the human rights based approach hrba,academic
abstract background local authorities have a crucial role in preparing for the impacts of climate change,academic
however the extent to which health impacts are being prioritized and acted on is not well understood,academic
methods we investigated the role of public health in adapting to climate change through i a content analysis of local authority climate change adaptation strategies in south west england and ii semi structured telephone interviews with local authority public health consultants and sustainability officers and a regional public health england representative n 11,academic
results adaptation strategies plans varied in existence and scope,academic
public health consultants did not have an explicit remit for climate change adaptation although related action often aligned with public health s emergency planning functions,academic
key barriers to health related adaptation were financial constraints lack of leadership and limited public and professional awareness about health impacts,academic
conclusions local authorities in south west england have differing approaches to tackling health impacts of climate change and the prominence of public health arguments for adaptation varies,academic
improved public health intelligence concise communications targeted support visible local and national leadership and clarity on economic costs and benefits of adaptation would be useful for local authorities in preparing for the health impacts of climate change,academic
the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc fifth assessment report ar5 states that climate change and ocean acidification are altering the oceans at a rate that is unprecedented compared with the recent past leading to multifaceted impacts on marine ecosystems associated goods and services and human societies,academic
ar5 underlined key uncertainties that remain regarding how synergistic changes in the ocean are likely to affect human systems and how humans are likely to respond to these events,academic
as climate change research has accelerated rapidly following ar5 an updated synthesis of available knowledge is necessary to identify emerging evidence and to thereby better inform policy discussions,academic
this paper reviews the literature to capture corroborating conflicting and novel findings published following the cut off date for contribution to ar5,academic
specifically we highlight key scientific developments on the impacts of climate induced changes in the ocean on key socioeconomic sectors including fisheries aquaculture and tourism,academic
new evidence continues to support a climate induced redistribution of benefits and losses at multiple scales and across coastal and marine socio ecological systems partly resulting from species and ecosystem range shifts and changes in primary productivity,academic
new efforts have been made to characterize and value ecosystem services in the context of climate change with specific relevance to ecosystem based adaptation,academic
recent studies have also explored synergistic interactions between climatic drivers and have found strong variability between impacts on species at different life stages,academic
although climate change may improve conditions for some types of freshwater aquaculture potentially providing alternative opportunities to adapt to impacts on wild capture fisheries ocean acidification poses a risk to shellfish fisheries and aquaculture,academic
the risk of increased prevalence of disease under warmer temperatures is uncertain and may detrimentally affect human health,academic
climate change may also induce changes in tourism flows leading to substantial geospatial shifts in economic costs and benefits associated with tourism revenue and coastal infrastructure protection and repairs,academic
while promising ecosystem based coastal adaptation approaches are still emerging and require an improved understanding of key ecosystem services and values for coastal communities in order to assess risk aid coastal development planning and build decision support systems,academic
climate change will increasingly affect the health of vulnerable populations including maternal and fetal health,academic
this systematic review aims to identify recent literature that investigates increasing heat and extreme temperatures on pregnancy outcomes globally,academic
we identify common research findings in order to create a comprehensive understanding of how immediate effects will be sustained in the next generation,academic
following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta analyses prisma guide we systematically reviewed articles from pubmed and cochrane reviews,academic
we included articles that identify climate change related exposures and adverse health effects for pregnant women,academic
there is evidence that temperature extremes adversely impact birth outcomes including but not limited to changes in length of gestation birth weight stillbirth and neonatal stress in unusually hot temperature exposures,academic
the studies included in this review indicate that not only is there a need for further research on the ways that climate change and heat in particular may affect maternal health and neonatal outcomes but that uniform standards for assessing the effects of heat on maternal fetal health also need to be established,academic
the author reflects on climate change and on the impact that climate change has on the built environment and public health,academic
she suggests that the effects of climate change are experienced in the built environments which surround most individuals,academic
she argues that as the effects of climate change become more apparent greater attention and approaches to increase awareness and reduce climate change are necessary to protect public health,academic
purpose older people account for the highest proportion of mortality from extreme weather events associated with climate change,academic
this article aims to describe the health impacts of climate change on older people,academic
type of study an integrative review was conducted with 30 studies retrieved from pubmed ebsco and the cumulative index to nursing and allied health literature cinahl on climate stressors determinants of resilient capacity risk factors and health outcomes,academic
findings heat temperature variability and air pollution increase mortality risk in older people especially from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,academic
floods are linked with increasing incidence of post traumatic stress disorder depression and anxiety,academic
facing these adversities older people exhibit both vulnerability and resilience,academic
conclusions research gaps exist in understanding the full spectrum of the resilience experience of older people and appreciating areas wherein nursing can play a pivotal role,academic
clinical relevance recognizing the vulnerabilities of older people in the context of climate change is important,academic
identifying opportunities to promote resilience is an important focus for nurses to develop tailored and targeted nursing interventions,academic
water resources are vital not only for human beings but essentially all ecosystems,academic
human health is at risk if clean drinking water becomes contaminated,academic
water is also essential for agriculture manufacturing energy production and other diverse uses,academic
therefore a changing climate and its potential effects put more pressure on water resources,academic
climate change may cause increased water demand as a result of rising temperatures and evaporation while decreasing water availability,academic
on the other hand extreme events as a result of climate change can increase surface runoff and flooding deteriorating water quality as well,academic
one effect is water eutrophication which occurs when high concentrations of nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus are present in the water,academic
nutrients come from different sources including agriculture wastewater stormwater and fossil fuel combustion,academic
algal blooms can cause many problems such as deoxygenation and water toxicity ultimately disrupting normal ecosystem functioning,academic
in this paper we investigate the potential impacts of climatic factors affecting water eutrophication how these factors are projected to change in the future and what their projected potential impacts will be,academic
background detection and attribution of health impacts caused by climate change uses formal methods to determine a whether the occurrence of adverse health outcomes has changed and b the extent to which that change could be attributed to climate change,academic
there have been limited efforts to undertake detection and attribution analyses in health,academic
objective our goal was to show a range of approaches for conducting detection and attribution analyses,academic
results case studies for heatwaves lyme disease in canada and vibrio emergence in northern europe highlight evidence that climate change is adversely affecting human health,academic
changes in rates and geographic distribution of adverse health outcomes were detected and in each instance a proportion of the observed changes could in our judgment be attributed to changes in weather patterns associated with climate change,academic
conclusions the results of detection and attribution studies can inform evidence based risk management to reduce current and plan for future changes in health risks associated with climate change,academic
gaining a better understanding of the size timing and distribution of the climate change burden of disease and injury requires reliable long term data sets more knowledge about the factors that confound and modify the effects of climate on health and refinement of analytic techniques for detection and attribution,academic
at the same time significant advances are possible in the absence of complete data and statistical certainty there is a place for well informed judgments based on understanding of underlying processes and matching of patterns of health climate and other determinants of human well being,academic
climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to the world,academic
s biosphere and to the global community,academic
it also represents a unique challenge for plant health,academic
human activities and increased market globalization coupled with rising temperatures has led to a situation that is favourable to pest movement and establishment,academic
this scientific review assesses the potential effects of climate change on plant pests and consequently on plant health,academic
the evidence assessed strongly indicates that climate change has already expanded some pests,academic
host range and geographical distribution and may further increase the risk of pest introduction to new areas,academic
this calls for international cooperation and development of harmonized plant protection strategies to help countries successfully adapt their pest risk management measures to climate change,academic
air pollution and climate change have a significant impact on human health and well being and contribute to the onset and aggravation of allergic rhinitis and asthma among other chronic respiratory diseases,academic
in westernized countries households have experienced a process of increasing insulation and individuals tend to spend most of their time indoors,academic
these sequelae implicate a high exposure to indoor allergens house dust mites pets molds etc tobacco smoke and other pollutants which have an impact on respiratory health,academic
outdoor air pollution derived from traffic and other human activities not only has a direct negative effect on human health but also enhances the allergenicity of some plants and contributes to global warming,academic
climate change modifies the availability and distribution of plant and fungal derived allergens and increases the frequency of extreme climate events,academic
this review summarizes the effects of indoor air pollution outdoor air pollution and subsequent climate change on asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults and addresses the policy adjustments and lifestyle changes required to mitigate their deleterious effects,academic
this review examines the current literature on the effects of future emissions and climate change on particulate matter pm and o3 air quality and on the consequent health impacts with a focus on europe,academic
there is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on o3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on pm concentrations,academic
under the latest intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc 5th assessment report ar5 representative concentration pathways rcps background o3 entering europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate,academic
however under the extreme pathway rcp8,academic
5 higher more than double methane ch4 abundances lead to increases in background o3 that offset the o3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period,academic
regionally in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides nox elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface o3 termed the o3 climate penalty especially in southern europe,academic
the o3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the o3 distribution such as daily maximum o3,academic
future changes in pm concentrations due to climate change are much less certain although several recent studies also suggest a pm climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid latitude land regions in 2100,academic
a larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the rcp scenarios,academic
under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change because of large reductions in emissions of o3 and pm pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself,academic
climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves,academic
air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves,academic
air quality during the 2003 heatwave over europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing o3 have been identified,academic
there are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality but these report higher o3 related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater pm2,academic
5 health burdens in these emission regions,academic
studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the rcp scenarios report reductions in global and european premature o3 respiratory related and pm mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions,academic
under rcp 8,academic
5 the large increase in ch4 leads to global and european excess o3 respiratory related mortalities in 2100,academic
for future health effects besides uncertainty in future o3 and particularly pm concentrations there is also uncertainty in risk estimates such as effect modification by temperature on pollutant response relationships and potential future adaptation that would alter exposure risk,academic
abstract china s climate has been warming since the 1950s with surface air temperature increasing at a rate higher than the global average,academic
changes in climate have exerted substantial impacts on water resources agriculture ecosystems and human health,academic
attributing past changes to causes provides a scientific foundation for national and international climate policies,academic
here we review recent progress in attributing the observed climate changes over past decades in china,academic
anthropogenic forcings dominated by greenhouse gas emissions are the main drivers for observed increases in mean and extreme temperatures,academic
evidence of the effect of anthropogenic forcings on precipitation is emerging,academic
human influence has increased the probability of extreme heat events and has likely changed the occurrence probabilities for some heavy precipitation events,academic
the way a specific attribution question is posed and the conditions under which the question is addressed present persistent challenges for appropriately communicating attribution results to non specialists,academic
the climate crisis poses a serious threat to the health and well being of individuals,academic
for many climate change knowledge is derived from indirect exposure to information transmitted through the media,academic
such content can elicit a variety of emotional responses including anger sadness despair fear and guilt,academic
worry and anxiety are especially common responses usually referred to as climate anxiety,academic
the main objectives of this study were to analyze how exposure to climate change through the media relates to climate anxiety and individual and collective self efficacy and to evaluate the relationship between climate anxiety and efficacy beliefs,academic
a total of 312 italian university students aged 18 26 years participated in the research by filling out an anonymous questionnaire,academic
participants reported being exposed several times per week to information about climate change especially from social media newspapers and television programs,academic
moreover the results showed that the attention paid to information about climate change was not only positively related to climate anxiety but also to individual and collective self efficacy,academic
most notably participants efficacy beliefs were found to be positively related to climate anxiety,academic
this somewhat controversial finding stresses that in the context of pro environmental behavior changes a moderate level of anxiety could engender feelings of virtue encouraging people to rethink actions with negative ecological impacts,academic
background approaches to estimating and addressing the risk to children from fossil fuel combustion have been fragmented tending to focus either on the toxic air emissions or on climate change,academic
yet developing children and especially poor children now bear a disproportionate burden of disease from both environmental pollution and climate change due to fossil fuel combustion,academic
objective this commentary summarizes the robust scientific evidence regarding the multiple current and projected health impacts of fossil fuel combustion on the young to make the case for a holistic child centered energy and climate policy that addresses the full array of physical and psychosocial stressors resulting from fossil fuel pollution,academic
discussion the data summarized here show that by sharply reducing our dependence on fossil fuels we would achieve highly significant health and economic benefits for our children and their future,academic
these benefits would occur immediately and also play out over the life course and potentially across generations,academic
conclusion going beyond the powerful scientific and economic arguments for urgent action to reduce the burning of fossil fuels is the strong moral imperative to protect our most vulnerable populations,academic

madagascar is cited as one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change with significant impacts to the health of its population,academic
in this study the vulnerability of madagascar s health sector to climate change was assessed and appropriate adaptation measures were identified,academic
in order to assess climate risks vulnerability and identify adaptation options the madagascar ministry of public health as well as the national meteorological and hydrological service worked in close collaboration with a team of local experts to conduct a literature review field surveys and analyses of current and future climate and health trends,academic
four climate sensitive diseases of primary concern are described in the study acute respiratory infections ari diarrhea malnutrition and malaria,academic
baseline conditions of these four diseases from 2000 to 2014 show acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are increasing in incidence while incidence of malnutrition and malaria decreased over this period,academic
to assess future impacts in madagascar this baseline information was used with climate projections for the two scenarios rcp 4,academic
5 and rcp 8,academic
5 for the periods 2016 2035 2036 2070 and 2071 2100,academic
future climate conditions are shown to exacerbate and increase the incidence of all four climate sensitive diseases,academic
further analysis of the exposure sensitivity and adaptive capacity to the climate hazards suggests that the health sector in four regions of madagascar is particularly vulnerable,academic
the study recommends adaptation measures to improve the monitoring and early warning systems for climate sensitive diseases as well as to reduce population vulnerability,academic
forests and trees throughout the world are increasingly affected by factors related to global change,academic
expanding international trade has facilitated invasions of numerous insects and pathogens into new regions,academic
many of these invasions have caused substantial forest damage economic impacts and losses of ecosystem goods and services provided by trees,academic
climate change is already affecting the geographic distribution of host trees and their associated insects and pathogens with anticipated increases in pest impacts by both native and invasive pests,academic
although climate change will benefit many forest insects changes in thermal conditions may disrupt evolved life history traits and cause phenological mismatches,academic
individually the threats posed to forest ecosystems by invasive pests and climate change are serious,academic
although interactions between these two drivers and their outcomes are poorly understood and hence difficult to predict it is clear that the cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems will be exacerbated,academic
herewe introduce and synthesize the information in this special issue of forestry with articles that illustrate the impacts of invasions of insects and pathogens climate change forest management and their interactions as well as methods to predict assess and mitigate these impacts,academic
most of these contributions were presented at the xxiv iufroworld congress in 2014,academic
climate change has led to significant rise of 0,academic
9 c in global mean temperature over the last century and has been linked with significant increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves extreme heat events,academic
climate change has also been increasingly connected to detrimental human health,academic
one of the consequences of climate related extreme heat exposure is dehydration and volume loss leading to acute mortality from exacerbations of pre existing chronic disease as well as from outright heat exhaustion and heat stroke,academic
recent studies have also shown that recurrent heat exposure with physical exertion and inadequate hydration can lead to ckd that is distinct from that caused by diabetes hypertension or gn,academic
epidemics of ckd consistent with heat stress nephropathy are now occurring across the world,academic
here we describe this disease discuss the locations where it appears to be manifesting link it with increasing temperatures and discuss ongoing attempts to prevent the disease,academic
heat stress nephropathy may represent one of the first epidemics due to global warming,academic
government industry and health policy makers in the impacted regions should place greater emphasis on occupational and community interventions,academic
the effects of climate change are accelerating and undermining human health and well being in many different ways,academic
there is no doubt that the health care sector will need to adapt and although it has begun to develop more targeted strategies to address climate related challenges a broad knowledge gap persists,academic
there is a critical need to develop and cultivate new knowledge and skill sets among health professionals including those in public health environmental science policy and communication roles,academic
this article describes specific initiatives to train future leaders to be proficient in understanding the linkages between climate change and health,academic
we present an agenda for expanding education on climate and health through health professional schools and graduate and postgraduate curricula as well as in professional and continuing education settings,academic
our agenda also identifies ways to promote sustainability in clinical practice and health care management and policy,academic
throughout we cite metrics by which to measure progress and highlight potential barriers to achieving these educational objectives on a larger scale,academic
background between 2010 and 2012 the world health organization division of pacific technical support led a regional climate change and health vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning project in collaboration with health sector partners in 13 pacific island countries cook islands federated states of micronesia fiji kiribati marshall islands nauru niue palau samoa solomon islands tonga tuvalu and vanuatu,academic
objective we assessed the vulnerabilities of pacific island countries to the health impacts of climate change and planned adaptation strategies to minimize such threats to health,academic
methods this assessment involved a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques,academic
the former included descriptive epidemiology time series analyses poisson regression and spatial modeling of climate and climate sensitive disease data in the few instances where this was possible the latter included wide stakeholder consultations iterative consensus building and expert opinion,academic
vulnerabilities were ranked using a likelihood versus impact matrix and adaptation strategies were prioritized and planned accordingly,academic
results the highest priority climate sensitive health risks in pacific island countries included trauma from extreme weather events heat related illnesses compromised safety and security of water and food vector borne diseases zoonoses respiratory illnesses psychosocial ill health non communicable diseases population pressures and health system deficiencies,academic
adaptation strategies relating to these climate change and health risks could be clustered according to categories common to many countries in the pacific region,academic
conclusion pacific island countries are among the most vulnerable in the world to the health impacts of climate change,academic
this vulnerability is a function of their unique geographic demographic and socioeconomic characteristics combined with their exposure to changing weather patterns associated with climate change the health risks entailed and the limited capacity of the countries to manage and adapt in the face of such risks,academic

east africa is highly affected by neglected tropical diseases ntds which are projected to be exacerbated by climate change,academic
consequently understanding what research has been conducted and what knowledge gaps remain regarding ntds and climate change is crucial to informing public health interventions and climate change adaptation,academic
we conducted a systematic scoping review to describe the extent range and nature of publications examining relationships between ntds and climatic factors in east africa,academic
we collated all relevant english and french publications indexed in pubmed web of science core collection and cab direct databases published before 2019,academic
ninety six publications were included for review,academic
kenya tanzania and ethiopia had high rates of publication whereas countries in the western indian ocean region were underrepresented,academic
most publications focused on schistosomiasis n 28 29,academic
2 soil transmitted helminthiases n 16 16,academic
7 or human african trypanosomiasis n 14 14,academic
precipitation n 91 94,academic
8 and temperature n 54 56,academic
3 were frequently investigated climatic factors whereas consideration of droughts n 10 10,academic
4 and floods n 4 4,academic
2 was not prominent,academic
publications reporting on associations between ntds and changing climate were increasing over time,academic
there was a decrease in the reporting of indigeneity and age factors over time,academic
overall there were substantial knowledge gaps for several countries and for many ntds,academic
to better understand ntds in the context of a changing climate it would be helpful to increase research on underrepresented diseases and regions consider demographic and social factors in research and characterize how these factors modify the effects of climatic variables on ntds in east africa,academic

with the emergence of covid 19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change key issues emerged that intersect with policy advocacy social justice and nursing s public health role in clinical practice education policy advocacy and research scholarship,academic
five themes that emerged included the role of public health in covid 19 and climate change efforts global approach addressing human environment issues intersection of covid 19 and climate change from a community and global perspective impacts of covid 19 climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations views and responsibilities with a lens on covid 19 and climate change,academic
despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as covid 19 no literature addressed this topic,academic
public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to covid 19 in the 21st century,academic
the impact of climate change on the environment biosphere and biodiversity has become more evident in the recent years,academic
human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide co2 and other greenhouse gases,academic
change in climate and the correlated global warming affects the quantity intensity and frequency of precipitation type as well as the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves droughts thunderstorms floods and hurricanes,academic
respiratory health can be particularly affected by climate change which contributes to the development of allergic respiratory diseases and asthma,academic
pollen and mold allergens are able to trigger the release of pro inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators that accelerate the onset the ige mediated sensitization and of allergy,academic
allergy to pollen and pollen season at its beginning in duration and intensity are altered by climate change,academic
studies showed that plants exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and reproductive effects and produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide co2,academic
mold proliferation is increased by floods and rainy storms are responsible for severe asthma,academic
pollen and mold allergy is generally used to evaluate the interrelation between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases such as rhinitis and asthma,academic
thunderstorms during pollen seasons can cause exacerbation of respiratory allergy and asthma in patients with hay fever,academic
a similar phenomenon is observed for molds,academic
measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have positive health benefits,academic
background climate change has been recognized as both one of the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities for global health in the 21st century,academic
this trend review seeks to assess and characterize the amount and type of scientific literature on the link between climate change and human health,academic
design we tracked the use of climate related terms and their co occurrence with health terms during the 25 years since the first intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc report from 1990 to 2014 in two scientific databases and in the ipcc reports,academic
we investigated the trends in the number of publications about health and climate change through time by nature of the health impact under study and by geographic area,academic
we compared the scientific production in the health field with that of other sectors on which climate change has an impact,academic
results the number of publications was extremely low in both databases from 1990 325 and 1 004 respectively until around 2006 1 332 and 4 319 respectively which has since then increased exponentially in recent years 6 079 and 17 395 respectively in 2014,academic
however the number of climate change papers regarding health is still about half that of other sectors,academic
certain health impacts particularly malnutrition and non communicable diseases ncds remain substantially understudied,academic
approximately two thirds of all published studies were carried out in oecd countries organization for economic cooperation and development predominantly in europe and north america,academic
conclusions there is a clear need for further research on the links between climate change and health,academic
this pertains particularly to research in and by those countries in which health will be mostly affected and capacity to adapt is least,academic
specific undertreated topics such as ncds malnutrition and mental health should gain the priority they deserve,academic
funding agencies are invited to take note of and establish calls for proposals accordingly,academic
raising the interest in this research area in young scientists remains a challenge and should lead to innovative courses for large audiences such as massive open online courses,academic
this study quantified the impacts of climate change on human health through undernourishment using two economic measures,academic
first changes in morbidity and mortality due to nine diseases caused by being underweight as a child were analyzed using a computable general equilibrium cge model with changes in the labor force population and demands for healthcare taken into consideration,academic
second changes in mortality were taken from the cge simulation and assessed economically by the value of lives lost and willingness to pay to reduce the risk,academic
model uncertainties in future crop yields and climate conditions were considered using future projections from six global crop models and five global climate models,academic
we found that the economic valuation of healthy lives lost due to undernourishment under climate change was equivalent to 0,academic
4 to 0,academic
0 of global gross domestic product gdp and was regionally heterogeneous ranging from 4,academic
0 to 0,academic
0 of regional gdp in 2100,academic
in contrast the actual economic losses associated with the effects of additional health expenditure and the decrease in the labor force due to undernourishment resulting from climate change corresponded to a 0,academic
1 to 0,academic
0 change in gdp and a 0,academic
2 to 0,academic
0 change in household consumption respectively at the global level,academic
the asia pacific region is regarded as the most disaster prone area of the world,academic
since 2000 1,academic
2 billion people have been exposed to hydrometeorological hazards alone through 1215 disaster events,academic
the impacts of climate change on meteorological phenomena and environmental consequences are well documented,academic
however the impacts on health are more elusive,academic
nevertheless climate change is believed to alter weather patterns on the regional scale giving rise to extreme weather events,academic
the impacts from extreme weather events are definitely more acute and traumatic in nature leading to deaths and injuries as well as debilitating and fatal communicable diseases,academic
extreme weather events include heat waves cold waves floods droughts hurricanes tropical cyclones heavy rain and snowfalls,academic
globally within the 20 year period from 1993 to 2012 more than 530 000 people died as a direct result of almost 15 000 extreme weather events with losses of more than us 2,academic

global facility and disaster reduction research centers linked to universities and international organizations international institute for sustainable development food and agriculture global climate fund and world bank are trying to reduce the water related impacts of climate change but due to lack of public awareness and health care infrastructure the death rate is steadily increasing,academic
this paper critically reviews the scientific studies and reports both at national and at international level benefiting generalists concerned with environmental and public health challenges,academic
the article underlines the urgent need for water conservation risk management and the development of mitigation measures to cope with the water related impacts of climate change on agriculture and subsequently on public health,academic
novel solutions and bioremediation methods have been presented to control environmental pollution and to promote awareness among the scientific community,academic
the focus is on diverse strategies to handle the forthcoming challenges associated with water resources management,academic
public health authorities are required to prepare for future threats and need predictions of the likely impact of climate change on public health risks,academic
they may get overwhelmed by the volume of heterogeneous information in scientific articles and risk relying purely on the public opinion articles which focus mainly on global warming trends and leave out many other relevant factors,academic
in the current paper we discuss various scientific approaches investigating climate change and its possible impact on public health and discuss their different roles and functions in unraveling the complexity of the subject,academic
it is not our objective to review the available literature or to make predictions for certain diseases or countries but rather to evaluate the applicability of scientific research articles on climate change to evidence based public health decisions,academic
in the context of mosquito borne diseases we identify common pitfalls to watch out for when assessing scientific research on the impact of climate change on human health,academic
we aim to provide guidance through the plethora of scientific papers and views on the impact of climate change on human health to those new to the subject as well as to remind public health experts of its multifactorial and multidisciplinary character,academic

physicians have a vital role in addressing climate change just as they did with tobacco by communicating how climate change is a serious but remediable hazard to their patients,academic
background in 2008 the world health organization who member states passed a world health assembly resolution that identified the following five priority areas for research and pilot projects on climate change and human health health vulnerability health protection health impacts of mitigation and adaptation policies decision support and other tools and costs of health protection from climate change,academic
objectives to assess the extent to which recently published research corresponds to these priorities we undertook a scoping review of original research on climate change and human health,academic
scoping reviews address topics that are too broad for a systematic review and commonly aim to identify research gaps in existing literature,academic
we also assessed recent publication trends for climate change and health research,academic
methods we searched for original quantitative research published from 2008 onward,academic
we included disease burden studies that were specific to climate change and health and included intervention studies that focused on climate change and measured health outcomes,academic
we used medline embase and web of science databases and extracted data on research priority areas geographic regions health fields and equity systematic differences between advantaged and disadvantaged social groups,academic
discussion we identified 40 eligible studies,academic
compared with other health topics the number of climate change publications has grown rapidly with a larger proportion of reviews or editorials,academic
recent original research addressed four of the five priority areas identified by the who member states but we found no eligible studies of health adaptation interventions and most of the studies focused on high income countries,academic
conclusions climate change and health is a rapidly growing area of research but quantitative studies remain rare,academic
among recently published studies we found gaps in adaptation research and a deficit of studies in most developing regions,academic
funders and researchers should monitor and respond to research gaps to help ensure that the needs of policymakers are met,academic
climate change is a well recognized threat to human health with impacts on every organ system and with implications for disease processes across subspecialties,academic
climate driven environmental exposures influence the pathophysiologic underpinnings of disease emphasized in the pre clinical years of medical school,academic
while medical schools are beginning to offer climate change and health electives medical education is lagging in providing fundamental climate and health content to adequately prepare the next generation of physicians for the challenges that they will face in the provision of healthcare and the prevention and treatment of disease,academic
this perspective piece highlights the unique role of medical students in catalyzing the incorporation of climate content into the pre clinical medical school curriculum and provides topics for disseminated curricular integration with the concepts emphasized in the pre clinical years of medical education,academic
climate change is causing increases in temperature changes in precipitation and extreme weather events sea level rise and other environmental impacts,academic
it is also causing or contributing to heat related disorders respiratory and allergic disorders infectious diseases malnutrition due to food insecurity and mental health disorders,academic
in addition increasing evidence indicates that climate change is causally associated with collective violence generally in combination with other causal factors,academic
increased temperatures and extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences including resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources are major pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence,academic
public health professionals can help prevent collective violence due to climate change a by supporting mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions b by promoting adaptation measures to address the consequences of climate change and to improve community resilience and c by addressing underlying risk factors for collective violence such as poverty and socioeconomic disparities,academic
climate variability is heavily impacting human health all around the globe in particular on residents of developing countries,academic
impacts on surface water and groundwater resources and water related illnesses are increasing especially under changing climate scenarios such as diversity in rainfall patterns increasing temperature flash floods severe droughts heatwaves and heavy precipitation,academic
emerging water related diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya are reappearing and impacting on the life of the deprived as such the provision of safe water and health care is in great demand in developing countries to combat the spread of infectious diseases,academic
government academia and private water bodies are conducting water quality surveys and providing health care facilities but there is still a need to improve the present strategies concerning water treatment and management as well as governance,academic
in this review paper climate change pattern and risks associated with water related diseases in developing countries with particular focus on pakistan and novel methods for controlling both waterborne and water related diseases are discussed,academic
this study is important for public health care particularly in developing countries for policy makers and researchers working in the area of climate change water quality and risk assessment,academic
the nexus of covid 19 and climate change has so far brought attention to short term greenhouse gas ghg emissions reductions public health responses and clean recovery stimulus packages,academic
we take a more holistic approach making five broad comparisons between the crises with five associated lessons for climate change mitigation policy,academic
first delay is costly,academic
second policy design must overcome biases to human judgment,academic
third inequality can be exacerbated without timely action,academic
fourth global problems require multiple forms of international cooperation,academic
fifth transparency of normative positions is needed to navigate value judgments at the science policy interface,academic
learning from policy challenges during the covid 19 crisis could enhance efforts to reduce ghg emissions and prepare humanity for future crises,academic

opportunities exist to investigate health and climate change co benefits through a shift from motorized to active transport walking and cycling and a shift in dietary patterns away from a globalized diet to reduced consumption of meat and energy dense foods,academic
given the ubiquitous use and proliferation of smartphone apps an opportunity exists to use this technology to capture individual travel and dietary behavior and the associated impact on the environment and health,academic
objective the objective of the study is to identify describe the features and rate the quality of existing smartphone apps which capture personal travel and dietary behavior and simultaneously estimate the carbon cost and potential health consequences of these actions,academic
methods the google play and apple app stores were searched between october 19 and november 6 2015 and a secondary google search using the apps filter was conducted between august 8 and september 18 2016,academic
eligible apps were required to estimate the carbon cost of personal behaviors with the potential to include features to maximize health outcomes,academic
the quality of included apps was assessed by 2 researchers using the mobile application rating scale mars,academic
results out of 7213 results 40 apps were identified and rated,academic
multiple travel related apps were identified however no apps solely focused on the carbon impact or health consequences of dietary behavior,academic
none of the rated apps provided sufficient information on the health consequences of travel and dietary behavior,academic
some apps included features to maximize participant engagement and encourage behavior change towards reduced greenhouse gas emissions,academic
most apps were rated as acceptable quality as determined by the mars 1 was of poor quality and 10 apps were of good quality,academic
interrater reliability of the 2 evaluators was excellent icc 0,academic
94 95 ci 0,academic
conclusions existing apps capturing travel and dietary behavior and the associated health and environmental impact are of mixed quality,academic
most apps do not include all desirable features or provide sufficient health information,academic
further research is needed to determine the potential of smartphone apps to evoke behavior change resulting in climate change and health co benefits,academic
climate change will have significant impacts on human health and urban populations are expected to be highly sensitive,academic
the health risks from climate change in cities are compounded by rapid urbanization high population density and climate sensitive built environments,academic
local governments are positioned to protect populations from climate health risks but it is unclear whether municipalities are producing climate adaptive policies,academic
in this article we develop and apply systematic methods to assess the state of public health adaptation in 401 urban areas globally with more than 1 million people creating the first global baseline for urban public health adaptation,academic
we find that only 10 of the sampled urban areas report any public health adaptation initiatives,academic
the initiatives identified most frequently address risks posed by extreme weather events and involve direct changes in management or behavior rather than capacity building research or long term investments in infrastructure,academic
based on our characterization of the current urban health adaptation landscape we identify several gaps limited evidence of reporting of institutional adaptation at the municipal level in urban areas in the global south lack of information based adaptation initiatives limited focus on initiatives addressing infectious disease risks and absence of monitoring reporting and evaluation,academic
the rate of global warming has accelerated over the past 50 years,academic
increasing surface temperature is melting glaciers and raising the sea level,academic
more flooding droughts hurricanes and heat waves are being reported,academic
accelerated changes in climate are already affecting human health in part by altering the epidemiology of climate sensitive pathogens,academic
in particular climate change may alter the incidence and severity of respiratory infections by affecting vectors and host immune responses,academic
certain respiratory infections such as avian influenza and coccidioidomycosis are occurring in locations previously unaffected apparently because of global warming,academic
young children and older adults appear to be particularly vulnerable to rapid fluctuations in ambient temperature,academic
for example an increase in the incidence in childhood pneumonia in australia has been associated with sharp temperature drops from one day to the next,academic
extreme weather events such as heat waves floods major storms drought and wildfires are also believed to change the incidence of respiratory infections,academic
an outbreak of aspergillosis among japanese survivors of the 2011 tsunami is one such well documented example,academic
changes in temperature precipitation relative humidity and air pollution influence viral activity and transmission,academic
for example in early 2000 an outbreak of hantavirus respiratory disease was linked to a local increase in the rodent population which in turn was attributed to a two to threefold increase in rainfall before the outbreak,academic
climate sensitive respiratory pathogens present challenges to respiratory health that may be far greater in the foreseeable future,academic
climate change will have complex consequences for the environment society economy and people s health,academic
the issue of climate change has received comparatively little attention to date in the fields of sports science,academic
thus sport related health risks caused by climate change are discussed and summarized in a conceptual model presented here for the first time,academic
climate change is associated with the following increases of health related risks for athletes in particular direct consequences caused by extreme temperature and other extreme weather events e,academic
increasing risks due to heatwaves thunderstorms floods lightning ultraviolet radiation and indirect consequences as a result of climate induced changes to our ecosystem e,academic
due to increased air pollution by ozone higher exposures to allergens increasing risks of infection by viruses and bacteria and the associated vectors and reservoir organisms,academic
each aspect is supplemented with advice on the prevention of health hazards,academic
not only individual athletes but also sports organizations and local clubs will have to respond to the changes in our climate so that they can appropriately protect both athletes and spectators and ensure a plannable continuation of the sport in the future,academic
cities with a mediterranean type climate med cities are particularly susceptible to health risks from climate change since they are located in biogeographical hot spots that experience some of the strongest effects of the changing climate,academic
the study aims to highlight health impacts of climate change in med cities analyze local climate adaptation plans and make adaptation policy recommendations for the med city level,academic
we identified five med cities with a climate change adaptation plan adelaide barcelona cape town los angeles and santiago,academic
beyond their similar med climate features although santiago s are slightly different the cities have different socio economic characteristics in various aspects,academic
we analyzed each plan according to how it addresses climate change related drivers of health impacts among city dwellers,academic
for each driver we identified the types of policy adaptation tools that address it in the urban climate adaptation plans,academic
the surveyed cities address most of the fundamental climate change related drivers of risks to human health including rising temperatures flooding and drought but the policy measures to reduce negative impacts vary across cities,academic
we suggest recommendations for med cities in various aspects depending on their local needs and vulnerability challenges assessment of health risks extreme events management and long term adaptation among others,academic
background climate change poses a major public health threat,academic
a survey of u,academic
local health department directors in 2008 found widespread recognition of the threat but limited adaptive capacity due to perceived lack of expertise and other resources,academic
methods we assessed changes between 2008 and 2012 in local public health departments preparedness for the public health threats of climate change in light of increasing national polarization on the issue and widespread funding cutbacks for public health,academic
a geographically representative online survey of directors of local public health departments was conducted in 2011 2012 n 174 response rate 50 and compared to the 2008 telephone survey results n 133 response rate 61,academic
results significant polarization had occurred more respondents in 2012 were certain that the threat of local climate change impacts does does not exist and fewer were unsure,academic
roughly 10 said it is not a threat compared to 1 in 2008,academic
adaptation capacity decreased in several areas perceived departmental expertise in climate change risk assessment departmental prioritization of adaptation and the number of adaptation related programs and services departments provided,academic
in 2008 directors perceptions of local impacts predicted the number of adaptation related programs and services their departments offered but in 2012 funding predicted programming and directors impact perceptions did not,academic
this suggests that budgets were constraining directors ability to respond to local climate change related health threats,academic
results also suggest that departmental expertise may mitigate funding constraints,academic
strategies for overcoming these obstacles to local public health departments preparations for climate change are discussed,academic
climate change is a major challenge facing public health,academic
national governments play a key role in public health adaptation to climate change but there are competing views on what responsibilities and obligations this will or should include in different nations,academic
this study aims to 1 examine how national level public health adaptation is occurring in organization for economic cooperation and development oecd countries 2 examine the roles national governments are taking in public health adaptation and 3 critically appraise three key governance dimensions of national level health adaptation cross sectoral collaboration vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning and identify practical examples suited to different contexts,academic
we systematically reviewed publicly available public health adaptation to climate change documents and webpages by national governments in ten oecd countries using systematic web searches assessment of self reporting and content analysis,academic
our findings suggest national governments are primarily addressing infectious disease and heat related risks posed by climate change typically emphasizing capacity building or information based groundwork initiatives,academic
we find national governments are taking a variety of approaches to public health adaptation to climate change that do not follow expected convergence and divergence by governance structure,academic
we discuss practical options for incorporating cross sectoral collaboration vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning into a variety of contexts and identify leaders national governments can look to to inform their public health adaptation planning,academic
following the adoption of the paris agreement and subsequent increased momentum for adaptation research tracking adaptation is needed to define what health adaptation looks like in practice reveal insights that can be taken up across states and sectors and ensure policy orientated learning,academic
backgroundindividuals with chronic health conditions or low socioeconomic status ses are more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change,academic
health communication can provide information on the management of these impacts,academic
this study tested among vulnerable audiences whether viewing targeted materials increases knowledge about the health impacts of climate change and strength of climate change beliefs and whether each are associated with stronger intentions to practice recommended behaviors,academic
methodslow ses respondents with chronic conditions were recruited for an online survey in six cities,academic
respondents were shown targeted materials illustrating the relationship between climate change and chronic conditions,academic
changes in knowledge and climate change beliefs pre and post test and behavioral intentions post test only were tested using mcnemar tests of marginal frequencies of two binary outcomes or paired t tests and multivariable linear regression,academic
qualitative interviews were conducted among target audiences to triangulate survey findings and make recommendations on the design of messages,academic
resultsrespondents n 122 reflected the target population regarding income educational level and prevalence of household health conditions,academic
significant increases in knowledge were found regarding groups that are most vulnerable to heat children p 0,academic
001 individuals with heart disease p 0,academic
001 or lung disease p 0,academic
019 and environmental conditions that increase allergy producing pollen increased heat p 0,academic
003 increased carbon dioxide p 0,academic

001 as did belief that climate change affected respondents health p 0,academic
3 behavioral intention,academic
at post test higher knowledge of heat vulnerabilities and environmental conditions that trigger pollen allergies were associated with greater behavioral intention scores p 0,academic
001 and p 0,academic
in depth interviews n 15 revealed that vulnerable audiences are interested in immediate term advice on health management and protective behaviors related to their chronic conditions but took less notice of messages about collective action to slow or stop climate change,academic
respondents identified both appealing and less favorable design elements in the materials,academic
conclusionsindividuals who are vulnerable to the health effects of climate change benefit from communication materials that explain using graphics and concise language how climate change affects health conditions and how to engage in protective adaptation behaviors,academic
background tropospheric ozone and black carbon bc a component of fine particulate matter pm 2,academic
5 µm in aerodynamic diameter pm2,academic
5 are associated with premature mortality and they disrupt global and regional climate,academic
objectives we examined the air quality and health benefits of 14 specific emission control measures targeting bc and methane an ozone precursor that were selected because of their potential to reduce the rate of climate change over the next 20 40 years,academic
methods we simulated the impacts of mitigation measures on outdoor concentrations of pm2,academic
5 and ozone using two composition climate models and calculated associated changes in premature pm2,academic
5 and ozone related deaths using epidemiologically derived concentration response functions,academic
results we estimated that for pm2,academic
5 and ozone respectively fully implementing these measures could reduce global population weighted average surface concentrations by 23 34 and 7 17 and avoid 0,academic
4 and 0,academic
52 million annual premature deaths globally in 2030,academic
more than 80 of the health benefits are estimated to occur in asia,academic
we estimated that bc mitigation measures would achieve approximately 98 of the deaths that would be avoided if all bc and methane mitigation measures were implemented due to reduced bc and associated reductions of nonmethane ozone precursor and organic carbon emissions as well as stronger mortality relationships for pm2,academic
5 relative to ozone,academic
although subject to large uncertainty these estimates and conclusions are not strongly dependent on assumptions for the concentration response function,academic
conclusions in addition to climate benefits our findings indicate that the methane and bc emission control measures would have substantial co benefits for air quality and public health worldwide potentially reversing trends of increasing air pollution concentrations and mortality in africa and south west and central asia,academic
these projected benefits are independent of carbon dioxide mitigation measures,academic
benefits of bc measures are underestimated because we did not account for benefits from reduced indoor exposures and because outdoor exposure estimates were limited by model spatial resolution,academic
background globally pollen allergy is a major public health problem but a fundamental unknown is the likely impact of climate change,academic
to our knowledge this is the first study to quantify the consequences of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans,academic
objectives we produced quantitative estimates of the potential impact of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans focusing upon common ragweed ambrosia artemisiifolia in europe,academic
methods a process based model estimated the change in ragweed s range under climate change,academic
a second model simulated current and future ragweed pollen levels,academic
these findings were translated into health burdens using a dose response curve generated from a systematic review and from current and future population data,academic
models considered two different suites of regional climate pollen models two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios representative concentration pathways rcps 4,academic
5 and 8,academic
5 and three different plant invasion scenarios,academic
results our primary estimates indicated that sensitization to ragweed will more than double in europe from 33 to 77 million people by 2041 2060,academic
according to our projections sensitization will increase in countries with an existing ragweed problem e,academic
hungary the balkans but the greatest proportional increases will occur where sensitization is uncommon e,academic
germany poland france,academic
higher pollen concentrations and a longer pollen season may also increase the severity of symptoms,academic
our model projections were driven predominantly by changes in climate 66 but were also influenced by current trends in the spread of this invasive plant species,academic
assumptions about the rate at which ragweed spreads throughout europe had a large influence upon the results,academic
conclusions our quantitative estimates indicate that ragweed pollen allergy will become a common health problem across europe expanding into areas where it is currently uncommon,academic
control of ragweed spread may be an important adaptation strategy in response to climate change,academic

climate change has become a great challenge to our generation and its impact is felt in almost every society in the world,academic
nigeria as a developing country with a population of about 180 million is likely to be adversely impacted by climate change due to its vulnerability and low coping capability,academic
evidences have shown that climate change impacts on nigeria arises from various climate change related causes experienced due to the increase in temperature rainfall sea level rise impact on fresh water resources extreme weather events flooding drought in the north and increased health risk,academic
the study reviews some existing literatures information policies and data on climate change in nigeria and its impact on the various sectors of the economy,academic
the finding for this paper indicates that many sectors of nigerian economy appear to be directly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change such as agricultural sector health energy etc,academic
this generally affects the growth of economy,academic
the impacts of climate changed highlighted in this study raise the need for more support in research and education awareness on the impact of climate change in nigeria,academic
this review attempts to create awareness on the impacts of climate change in nigeria and presents some policy recommendations for adaptation and mitigation measures to tackle the challenges,academic
abstract climate change with increasing temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels constitutes a severe threat to the environment and all living organisms,academic
in particular numerous studies suggest severe consequences for the health of crop plants affecting both the productivity and quality of raw material destined to the food industry,academic
of particular concern is the reduction of proteins and essential micronutrients as iron and zinc in crops,academic
fighting this alarming trends is the challenge of climate smart agriculture with the double goal of reducing environmental impacts use of pesticides nitrogen and phosphorus leaching soil erosion water depletion and contamination and improving raw material and consequently food quality,academic
organic farming biofertilizers and to a lesser extent nano carriers improve the antioxidant properties of fruits but the data about proteins and micronutrients are rather contradictory,academic
on the other hand advanced devices and precision agriculture allow the cultivations to be more profitable efficient contributing more and more to reduce pest diseases and to increase the quality of agricultural products and food safety,academic
thus nowadays adoption of technologies applied to sustainable farming systems is a challenging and dynamic issue for facing negative trends due to environmental impacts and climate changes,academic
countries in the world health organization who south east asia region are particularly vulnerable to a changing climate,academic
changes in extreme weather events undernutrition and the spread of infectious diseases are projected to increase the number of deaths due to climate change by 2030 indicating the need to strengthen activities for adaptation and mitigation,academic
with support from the who regional office for south east asia and others countries have started to include climate change as a key consideration in their national public health policies,academic
further efforts are needed to develop evidence based responses garner the necessary support from partner ministries and access funding for activities related to health and climate change,academic
national action plans for climate change generally identify health as one of their priorities however limited information is available on implementation processes including which ministries and departments would be involved the time frame stakeholder responsibilities and how the projects would be financed,academic
while progress is being made efforts are needed to increase the capacity of health systems to manage the health risks of climate change in south east asia if population health is to be protected and strengthened while addressing changing weather and climate patterns,academic
enhancing the resilience of health systems is key to ensuring a sustainable path to improved planetary and population health,academic
the impacts of climate on health and wellbeing occur in time and space and through a range of indirect complicated mechanisms,academic
this diversity of pathways has major implications for national public health planning and influence on interventions that might help to mitigate and adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions nationally and internationally,academic
this paper draws upon evidence from public health and adverse impact studies across climate science hydrology agriculture public health and the social sciences,academic
it presents a conceptual model to support decision making by recognizing both the proximal and distal pathways from climate induced environmental change to national health and wellbeing,academic
the proximal and distal pathways associated with food security migration and mobility illustrate the diverse climate change influences in different geographic locations over different timescales,academic
we argue that greater realization and articulation of proximal and distal pathways should radically alter how climate change is addressed as a national and international public health challenge,academic

the objective of this review was to analyse the potential risk and vulnerability in the context of climate sensitive human diseases and health system in tanzania,academic
climate sensitive vector and waterborne diseases and other health related problems and the policies on climate adaptation in tanzania during the past 50 years are reviewed,academic
the review has shown that a number of climate associated infectious disease epidemics have been reported in various areas of the country mostly being associated with increase in precipitation and temperature,academic
although there is no single policy document that specifically addresses issues of cc in the country the national environmental management act of 1997 recognizes the importance of cc and calls for the government to put up measures to address the phenomenon,academic
a number of strategies and action plans related to cc are also in place,academic
these include the national biodiversity strategy and action plan the national action programme and the national bio safety framework,academic
the government has put in place a national climate change steering committee and the national climate change technical committee to oversee and guide the implementation of cc activities in the country,academic
recognizing the adverse impacts of natural disasters and calamities the government established a disaster management division under the prime minister s office,academic
epidemic preparedness and response unit of the ministry of health and social welfare is responsible for emergency preparedness mostly disease outbreaks,academic
however specific climate changes associated with human health issues are poorly addressed in the mohsw strategies and the national health research priorities,academic
in conclusion cc threatens to slow halt or reverses the progress the country has made or is making to achieve its national and millennium development goals,academic
it is therefore important that tanzania prepares itself to appropriately address cc impact on human health,academic
it is equally important that policy makers and other stakeholders are engaged in a process to update and adapt priorities mobilize resources and build interdisciplinary research and implementation capacity on climate change and its mitigation,academic
abstract climate change and non communicable diseases ncds are two of the most important global health challenges of this century,academic
pacific island countries and territories picts are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and face an increasingly high burden of ncds,academic
this review synthesizes the evidence for the links between climate change food and nutrition security fns and ncds in the pacific region and outlines the possible implications of these relationships,academic
a comprehensive search was performed on global databases including pubmed scopus and sciencedirect the grey literature and reference lists,academic
four dominant pathways between climate change fns and ncds emerged from the literature the impact of climate change on agriculture fisheries migration and humanitarian food assistance,academic
these pathways if not addressed are likely to lead to impaired fns and an increased burden of ncds in picts,academic
there is little doubt that pacific nations will experience adverse impacts of climate change exacerbating existing health risks and other socio cultural political and economic drivers of food and nutrition insecurity and ncds,academic
further research is needed to strengthen the evidence and develop integrated context specific solutions,academic
it is however imperative to take action to address these issues via a cross sectoral no regrets health in all policies approach,academic
climate change is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century,academic
climate directly impacts health through climatic extremes air quality sea level rise and multifaceted influences on food production systems and water resources,academic
climate also affects infectious diseases which have played a significant role in human history impacting the rise and fall of civilizations and facilitating the conquest of new territories,academic
our review highlights significant regional changes in vector and pathogen distribution reported in temperate peri arctic arctic and tropical highland regions during recent decades changes that have been anticipated by scientists worldwide,academic
further future changes are likely if we fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change,academic
many key factors affect the spread and severity of human diseases including mobility of people animals and goods control measures in place availability of effective drugs quality of public health services human behavior and political stability and conflicts,academic
with drug and insecticide resistance on the rise significant funding and research efforts must to be maintained to continue the battle against existing and emerging diseases particularly those that are vector borne,academic
na workers are uniquely susceptible to the health hazards imposed by environmental changes,academic
occupational and environmental medicine oem providers are at the forefront of emerging health issues pertaining to working populations including climate change and must be prepared to recognize respond to and mitigate climate change related health effects in workers,academic
this guidance document from the american college of occupational and environmental medicine focuses on north american workers health effects that may occur as a result of climate change and describes the responsibilities of the oem provider in responding to these health challenges,academic
importance health is inextricably linked to climate change,academic
it is important for clinicians to understand this relationship in order to discuss associated health risks with their patients and to inform public policy,academic
objectives to provide new us based temperature projections from downscaled climate modeling and to review recent studies on health risks related to climate change and the cobenefits of efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions,academic
data sources study selection and data synthesis we searched pubmed and google scholar from 2009 to 2014 for articles related to climate change and health focused on governmental reports predictive models and empirical epidemiological studies,academic
of the more than 250 abstracts reviewed 56 articles were selected,academic
in addition we analyzed climate data averaged over 13 climate models and based future projections on downscaled probability distributions of the daily maximum temperature for 2046 2065,academic
we also compared maximum daily 8 hour average ozone with air temperature data taken from the national oceanic and atmospheric administration national climate data center,academic
results by 2050 many us cities may experience more frequent extreme heat days,academic
for example new york and milwaukee may have 3 times their current average number of days hotter than 32 c 90 f,academic
high temperatures are also strongly associated with ozone exceedance days for example in chicago illinois,academic
the adverse health aspects related to climate change may include heat related disorders such as heat stress and economic consequences of reduced work capacity respiratory disorders including those exacerbated by air pollution and aeroallergens such as asthma infectious diseases including vectorborne diseases and waterborne diseases such as childhood gastrointestinal diseases food insecurity including reduced crop yields and an increase in plant diseases and mental health disorders such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression that are associated with natural disasters,academic
substantial health and economic cobenefits could be associated with reductions in fossil fuel combustion,academic
for example greenhouse gas emission policies may yield net economic benefit with health benefits from air quality improvements potentially offsetting the cost of us and international carbon policies,academic
conclusions and relevance evidence over the past 20 years indicates that climate change can be associated with adverse health outcomes,academic
health care professionals have an important role in understanding and communicating the related potential health concerns and the cobenefits from policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions,academic
backgroundpakistan is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geographic location high dependence on agriculture and water resources low adaptive capacity of its people and weak system of emergency preparedness,academic
this paper is the first ever attempt to rank the agro ecological zones in pakistan according to their vulnerability to climate change and to identify the potential health repercussions of each manifestation of climate change in the context of pakistan,academic
methodsa climate change vulnerability index is constructed as an un weighted average of three sub indices measuring a the ecological exposure of each region to climate change b sensitivity of the population to climate change and c the adaptive capacity of the population inhabiting a particular region,academic
the regions are ranked according to the value of this index and its components,academic
since health is one of the most important dimensions of human wellbeing this paper also identifies the potential health repercussions of each manifestations of climate change and links it with the key manifestations of climate change in the context of pakistan,academic
resultsthe results indicate that balochistan is the most vulnerable region with high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity followed by low intensity punjab mostly consisting of south punjab and cotton wheat sindh,academic
the health risks that each of these regions face depend upon the type of threat that they face from climate change,academic
greater incidence of flooding which may occur due to climate variability poses the risk of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis skin and eye infections acute respiratory infections and malaria,academic
exposure to drought poses the potential health risks in the form of food insecurity and malnutrition anaemia night blindness and scurvy,academic
increases in temperature pose health risks of heat stroke malaria dengue respiratory diseases and cardiovascular diseases,academic
conclusionthe study concludes that geographical zones that are more exposed to climate change in ecological and geographic terms such as balochistan low intensity punjab and cotton wheat sindh also happen to be the most deprived regions in pakistan in terms of socio economic indicators suggesting that the government needs to direct its efforts to the socio economic uplift of these lagging regions to reduce their vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change,academic
abstract anthropogenic climate change appears to be increasing the frequency duration and intensity of extreme weather events,academic
such events have already had substantial impacts on socioeconomic development and population health,academic
climate change s most profound impacts are likely to be on food health systems and water,academic
this paper explores how climate change will affect food human health and water in china,academic
projections indicate that the overall effects of climate change land conversion and reduced water availability could reduce chinese food production substantially although uncertainty is inevitable in such projections,academic
climate change will probably have substantial impacts on water resources e,academic
changes in rainfall patterns and increases in the frequencies of droughts and floods in some areas of china,academic
such impacts would undoubtedly threaten population health and well being in many communities,academic
in the short term population health in china is likely to be adversely affected by increases in air temperatures and pollution,academic
in the medium to long term however the indirect impacts of climate change e,academic
changes in the availability of food shelter and water decreased mental health and well being and changes in the distribution and seasonality of infectious diseases are likely to grow in importance,academic
the potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change can only be avoided if all countries work together towards a substantial reduction in the emission of so called greenhouse gases and a substantial increase in the global population s resilience to the risks of climate variability and change,academic
climate change is one of today s most pressing global issues,academic
policies to guide mitigation and adaptation are needed to avoid the devastating impacts of climate change,academic
the health sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries and its climate impact in low income countries is growing steadily,academic
this paper reviews and discusses the literature regarding health sector mitigation potential known and hypothetical co benefits and the potential of health information technology such as ehealth in climate change mitigation and adaptation,academic
the promising role of ehealth as an adaptation strategy to reduce societal vulnerability to climate change and the link s between mitigation and adaptation are also discussed,academic
the topic of environmental ehealth has gained little attention to date despite its potential to contribute to more sustainable and green health care,academic
a growing number of local and global initiatives on green information and communication technology ict are now mentioning ehealth as a promising technology with the potential to reduce emission rates from ict use,academic
however the embracing of ehealth is slow because of limitations in technological infrastructure capacity and political will,academic
further research on potential emissions reductions and co benefits with green ict in terms of health outcomes and economic effectiveness would be valuable to guide development and implementation of ehealth in health sector mitigation and adaptation policies,academic
background climate change is projected to cause substantial increases in population movement in coming decades,academic
previous research has considered the likely causal influences and magnitude of such movements and the risks to national and international security,academic
there has been little research on the consequences of climate related migration and the health of people who move,academic
objectives in this review we explore the role that health impacts of climate change may play in population movements and then examine the health implications of three types of movements likely to be induced by climate change forcible displacement by climate impacts resettlement schemes and migration as an adaptive response,academic
methods this risk assessment draws on research into the health of refugees migrants and people in resettlement schemes as analogs of the likely health consequences of climate related migration,academic
some account is taken of the possible modulation of those health risks by climate change,academic
discussion climate change related migration is likely to result in adverse health outcomes both for displaced and for host populations particularly in situations of forced migration,academic
however where migration and other mobility are used as adaptive strategies health risks are likely to be minimized and in some cases there will be health gains,academic
conclusions purposeful and timely policy interventions can facilitate the mobility of people enhance well being and maximize social and economic development in both places of origin and places of destination,academic
nevertheless the anticipated occurrence of substantial relocation of groups and communities will underscore the fundamental seriousness of human induced climate change,academic
droughts have been recorded all across canada and have had significant impacts on individuals and communities,academic
with climate change projections suggest an increasing risk of drought in canada particularly in the south and interior,academic
however there has been little research on the impacts of drought on human health and the implications of a changing climate,academic
a review of the canadian u,academic
and international literature relevant to the canadian context was conducted to better define these impacts and adaptations available to protect health,academic
drought can impact respiratory health mental health illnesses related to exposure to toxins food water security rates of injury and infectious diseases including food water and vector borne diseases,academic
a range of direct and indirect adaptation e,academic
agricultural adaptation options exist to cope with drought,academic
many have already been employed by public health officials such as communicable disease monitoring and surveillance and public education and outreach,academic
however gaps exist in our understanding of the impacts of short term vs,academic
prolonged drought on the health of canadians projections of drought and its characteristics at the regional level and the effectiveness of current adaptations,academic
further research will be critical to inform adaptation planning to reduce future drought related risks to health,academic
we all know that 2014 has been declared as the hottest year globally by the meteorological department of united states of america,academic
climate change is a global challenge which is likely to affect the mankind in substantial ways,academic
not only climate change is expected to affect physical health it is also likely to affect mental health,academic
increasing ambient temperatures is likely to increase rates of aggression and violent suicides while prolonged droughts due to climate change can lead to more number of farmer suicides,academic
droughts otherwise can lead to impaired mental health and stress,academic
increased frequency of disasters with climate change can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder adjustment disorder and depression,academic
changes in climate and global warming may require population to migrate which can lead to acculturation stress,academic
it can also lead to increased rates of physical illnesses which secondarily would be associated with psychological distress,academic
the possible effects of mitigation measures on mental health are also discussed,academic
the paper concludes with a discussion of what can and should be done to tackle the expected mental health issues consequent to climate change,academic
climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger,academic
a robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability,academic
the stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short term variability in supply,academic
however the potential impact is less clear at regional scales but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition,academic
likewise it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health,academic
the evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a climate smart food system that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security,academic
background anthropogenic climate change will affect global food production with uncertain consequences for human health in developed countries,academic
objectives we investigated the potential impact of climate change on food security nutrition and food safety and the implications for human health in developed countries,academic
methods expert input and structured literature searches were conducted and synthesized to produce overall assessments of the likely impacts of climate change on global food production and recommendations for future research and policy changes,academic
results increasing food prices may lower the nutritional quality of dietary intakes exacerbate obesity and amplify health inequalities,academic
altered conditions for food production may result in emerging pathogens new crop and livestock species and altered use of pesticides and veterinary medicines and affect the main transfer mechanisms through which contaminants move from the environment into food,academic
all these have implications for food safety and the nutritional content of food,academic
climate change mitigation may increase consumption of foods whose production reduces greenhouse gas emissions,academic
impacts may include reduced red meat consumption with positive effects on saturated fat but negative impacts on zinc and iron intake and reduced winter fruit and vegetable consumption,academic
developed countries have complex structures in place that may be used to adapt to the food safety consequences of climate change although their effectiveness will vary between countries and the ability to respond to nutritional challenges is less certain,academic
conclusions climate change will have notable impacts upon nutrition and food safety in developed countries but further research is necessary to accurately quantify these impacts,academic
uncertainty about future impacts coupled with evidence that climate change may lead to more variable food quality emphasizes the need to maintain and strengthen existing structures and policies to regulate food production monitor food quality and safety and respond to nutritional and safety issues that arise,academic
for many of us working in the indoor air sciences it is clear that climate change has implications to buildings beyond modifying cooling and heating demands,academic
thus it is surprising that in the world of climate science and policy so little is said about how extreme weather events and long term climate conditions might affect health through modification of indoor environments,academic
even in the most recent intergovernmental panel on climate change report ipcc 2007a there is only brief reference to indoor health risk in terms of occupational heat stress and possible co benefits of reducing biomass fuel use,academic
the health concerns that climate scientists have focused on include ecosystem disruption and zoopathogens toxic algal blooms vector borne diseases heat stress crop losses and diminished nutritional value of food,academic
meanwhile the indoor environment until recently has not been considered,academic
the us environmental protection agency epa asked the institute of medicine iom of the national academy of sciences to convene an expert committee to summarize the current state of scientific understanding of the effects of climate change on indoor air and public health and to identify priorities for action,academic
the committee which i chaired included members with expertise in climate science aerosol physics architecture mycology medicine infectious diseases exposure assessment and epidemiology,academic
table 1 lists the committee members,academic
the committee was greatly aided by epa commissioned white papers http www,academic
html and by workshops held in washington dc and berkeley ca where we heard from indoor air and building scientists physiologists and insurance risk assessors,academic
the specific topic of climate change and indoor environments is so new that our insights have to be gleaned from what is already known about building conditions and occupant behaviors and from inferred responses to environmental conditions that might result from the perturbed climate that nature has in store for us,academic
however this limitation does not mean that little can be said about the implications of climate stresses on infrastructure,academic
relying substantially on synthesis from a large body of information on building conditions that lead to discomfort degraded health and lost productivity the committee recognized that indoor environmental conditions already pose considerable health risk and that a warmer atmosphere with increased outdoor air pollution forest fires pollen and dust heat waves excessive rainfall droughts and the longer term aberrations of regional climates would impact building performance and occupant health,academic
several scenarios can be envisioned in which climate change and weather extremes might impact buildings,academic
pollution and pollen which are expected to increase can penetrate indoors,academic
once indoors reactive air pollutants like ozone can undergo further reactions,academic
building elements and furnishings can become wet and lead to mold growth or infestations,academic
building envelopes can become hotter during heat waves adding to thermal stress,academic
changes in the atmospheric conditions over time will challenge building hvac systems currently designed to manage contaminants and meet thermal comfort expectations that are based on the past 30 years of weather records,academic
figure 1 displays some of the possible pathways by which weather changes could influence the health of building occupants,academic
we cannot blame all potentially adverse outcomes on weather alone,academic
actions are being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy reduction by promoting high efficiency building designs renovations and operation,academic
buildings are being audited via,academic
global climate change is impacting organisms biological communities and ecosystems around the world,academic
while most research has focused on characterizing how the climate is changing including modeling future climatic conditions and predicting the impacts of these conditions on biodiversity it is also the case that climate change is altering the environmental impacts of chemical pollution,academic
future climate conditions are expected to influence both the worldwide distribution of chemicals and the toxi cological consequences of chemical exposures to organisms,academic
many of the environmental changes associated with a warming global climate e,academic
increased average and possibly extreme temperatures intense periods of drier and wetter conditions reduced ocean ph altered salinity dynamics in estuaries have the potential to enhance organism susceptibility to chemical toxicity,academic
addi tionally chemical exposures themselves may impair the ability of organisms to cope with the changing environmental conditions of the shifting climate,academic
such reciprocity in the interactions between climate change and chemicals illustrates the complexity inherent in predicting the toxicological consequences of chemical exposures under future climate scenarios,academic
here we summarize what is currently known about the potential reciprocal effects of climate change and chemical toxicity on wildlife and depict current ap proaches and ongoing challenges for incorporating climate effects into chemical testing and assessment,academic
given the rapid pace of new man made chemistries the development of accurate and rapid methods to evaluate multiple chemical and non chemical stressors in an ecologically relevant context will be critical to understanding toxic and endocrine disrupting effects of chemical pollutants under future climate scenarios current zoology 61 4 669 689 2015,academic
climate change is affecting and will increasingly influence human health and wellbeing,academic
children are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change,academic
an extensive literature review regarding the impact of climate change on children s health was conducted in april 2012 by searching electronic databases pubmed scopus proquest sciencedirect and web of science as well as relevant websites such as ipcc and who,academic
climate change affects children s health through increased air pollution more weather related disasters more frequent and intense heat waves decreased water quality and quantity food shortage and greater exposure to toxicants,academic
as a result children experience greater risk of mental disorders malnutrition infectious diseases allergic diseases and respiratory diseases,academic
mitigation measures like reducing carbon pollution emissions and adaptation measures such as early warning systems and post disaster counseling are strongly needed,academic
future health research directions should focus on 1 identifying whether climate change impacts on children will be modified by gender age and socioeconomic status 2 refining outcome measures of children s vulnerability to climate change 3 projecting children s disease burden under climate change scenarios 4 exploring children s disease burden related to climate change in low income countries and 5 identifying the most cost effective mitigation and adaptation actions from a children s health perspective,academic
abstract introduction biodiversity and biodiversity based ecosystems services are intrinsically dependent on the climate,academic
during the twentieth century climate change has posed major threats to biodiversity in africa and impacts are expected to increase as climate change continues and perhaps even accelerates,academic
outcomes our review shows that the multiple components of climate change are projected to affect all levels of biodiversity from genes over species to biome level,academic
loss of biodiversity as a result of climate change can alter the structures and functions of african ecological systems,academic
as a result the provision of biodiversity based ecosystem services and the well being of people that rely on these services are being modified,academic
of particular concerns are tipping points where the exceedance of ecosystem thresholds will possibly lead to irreversible shifts of the structure of ecosystems and their services,academic
in recent years climate prediction models have portended continued warming and more frequent extreme weather events across the region,academic
such weather related disturbances such as el niño will place a premium on biodiversity and biodiversity based ecosystem services that people rely on,academic
conclusion as biodiversity underlies all goods and services provided by ecosystems that are crucial for human survival and well being this paper synthesizes and discusses observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on biodiversity and biodiversity based ecosystem service provision and livelihoods and what strategies might be employed to decrease current and future risks on the well being of human in africa,academic
in this united states focused analysis we use outputs from two general circulation models gcms driven by different greenhouse gas forcing scenarios as inputs to regional climate and chemical transport models to investigate potential changes in near term u,academic
air quality due to climate change,academic
we conduct multiyear simulations to account for interannual variability and characterize the near term influence of a changing climate on tropospheric ozone related health impacts near the year 2030 which is a policy relevant time frame that is subject to fewer uncertainties than other approaches employed in the literature,academic
we adopt a 2030 emissions inventory that accounts for fully implementing anthropogenic emissions controls required by federal state and or local policies which is projected to strongly influence future ozone levels,academic
we quantify a comprehensive suite of ozone related mortality and morbidity impacts including emergency department visits hospital admissions acute respiratory symptoms and lost school days and estimate the economic value of these impacts,academic
both gcms project average daily maximum temperature to increase by 1 4 c and 1 5 ppb increases in daily 8 hr maximum ozone at 2030 though each climate scenario produces ozone levels that vary greatly over space and time,academic
we estimate tens to thousands of additional ozone related premature deaths and illnesses per year for these two scenarios and calculate an economic burden of these health outcomes of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of u,academic
implications near term changes to the climate have the potential to greatly affect ground level ozone,academic
using a 2030 emission inventory with regional climate fields downscaled from two general circulation models we project mean temperature increases of 1 to 4 c and climate driven mean daily 8 hr maximum ozone increases of 1 5 ppb though each climate scenario produces ozone levels that vary significantly over space and time,academic
these increased ozone levels are estimated to result in tens to thousands of ozone related premature deaths and illnesses per year and an economic burden of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of u,academic
climate change is already taking a toll on human health a toll that is likely to increase in coming decades,academic
the relationship between risk perceptions and vulnerability to climate change s health threats has received little attention even though an understanding of the dynamics of adaptation among particularly susceptible populations is becoming increasingly important,academic
we demonstrate that some people whose health will suffer the greatest harms from climate change due to social vulnerability health susceptibility and exposure to hazards already feel they are at risk,academic
in a 2013 survey we measured maryland residents climate beliefs health risk perceptions and household social vulnerability characteristics including medical conditions n 2126,academic
we paired survey responses with secondary data sources for residence in a floodplain and or urban heat island to predict perceptions of personal and household climate health risk,academic
general health risk perceptions political ideology and climate beliefs are the strongest predictors,academic
yet people in households with the following characteristics also see themselves at higher risk members with one or more medical conditions or disabilities low income racial ethnic minorities and residence in a floodplain,academic
in light of these results climate health communication among vulnerable populations should emphasize protective actions instead of risk messages,academic
backgroundbangladesh has been identified as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world concerning the adverse effects of climate change cc,academic
however little is known about the perception of cc from the community which is important for developing adaptation strategies,academic
methodsthe study was a cross sectional survey of respondents from two villages one from the northern part and the other from the southern part of bangladesh,academic
a total of 450 households were selected randomly through multistage sampling completed a semi structure questionnaire,academic
this was supplemented with 12 focus group discussions fgds and 15 key informant interviews kiis,academic
resultsover 95 percent of the respondents reported that the heat during the summers had increased and 80,academic
2 percent reported that rainfall had decreased compared to their previous experiences,academic
approximately 65 percent reported that winters were warmer than in previous years but they still experienced very erratic and severe cold during the winter for about 5 7 days which restricted their activities with very destructive effect on agricultural production everyday life and the health of people,academic
fgds and kiis also reported that overall winters were warmer,academic
eighty point two percent 72,academic
5 percent and 54,academic
7 percent survey respondents perceived that the frequency of water heat and cold related diseases health problems respectively had increased compared to five to ten years ago,academic
fgds and kiis respondents were also reported the same,academic
conclusionsrespondents had clear perceptions about changes in heat cold and rainfall that had occurred over the last five to ten years,academic
local perceptions of climate variability cv included increased heat overall warmer winters reduced rainfall and fewer floods,academic
the effects of cv were mostly negative in terms of means of living human health agriculture and overall livelihoods,academic
most local perceptions on cv are consistent with the evidence regarding the vulnerability of bangladesh to cc,academic
such findings can be used to formulate appropriate sector programs and interventions,academic
the systematic collection of such information will allow scientists researchers and policy makers to design and implement appropriate adaptation strategies for cc in countries that are especially vulnerable,academic
climate change poses numerous risks to the health of canadians,academic
extreme weather events poor air quality and food insecurity in northern regions are likely to increase along with the increasing incidence and range of infectious diseases,academic
in this study we identify and characterize canadian federal provincial territorial and municipal adaptation to these health risks based on publically available information,academic
federal health adaptation initiatives emphasize capacity building and gathering information to address general health infectious disease and heat related risks,academic
provincial and territorial adaptation is varied,academic
quebec is a leader in climate change adaptation having a notably higher number of adaptation initiatives reported addressing almost all risks posed by climate change in the province and having implemented various adaptation types,academic
meanwhile all other canadian provinces and territories are in the early stages of health adaptation,academic
based on publically available information reported adaptation also varies greatly by municipality,academic
the six sampled canadian regional health authorities or equivalent are not reporting any adaptation initiatives,academic
we also find little relationship between the number of initiatives reported in the six sampled municipalities and their provinces suggesting that municipalities are adapting or not adapting autonomously,academic
background hydro meteorological disasters are the focus of this paper,academic
the authors examine to which extent climate change increases their frequency and intensity,academic
methods review of ipcc projections of climate change related extreme weather events and related literature on health effects,academic
results projections show that climate change is likely to increase the frequency intensity duration and spatial distribution of a range of extreme weather events over coming decades,academic
conclusions there is a need for strengthened collaboration between climate scientists the health researchers and policy makers as well as the disaster community to jointly develop adaptation strategies to protect human,academic
climate change particularly its associated sea level rise is major threat to mangrove coastal areas and it is essential to develop ways to reduce vulnerability through strategic management planning,academic
vulnerability has three dimensions of exposure to stresses associated sensitivity and related adaptive capacity and ways to measure components of each were trialled at sites in africa and the south pacific to develop an analysis procedure based on ranking,academic
the approaches of the ranking system for vulnerability assessment of mangrove systems integrate biotic and abiotic factors along with human management components using validated methods previously developed for other research questions,academic
these include determining mangrove forest health adjacent ecosystem resilience the extent and effects of human impacts and the environmental conditions of different mangrove settings,academic
results of the vulnerability assessment ranking using up to 20 measurements found all sites to have some components of vulnerability,academic
douala estuary cameroon showed the highest vulnerability owing to low tidal range impacts from non climate stressors and evidence of moderate seaward edge retreat,academic
tikina wai fiji showed inherent vulnerability owing to location on a subsiding coastline with a low tidal range but this was offset by strong local community management capacity,academic
rufiji delta tanzania showed inherent resilience owing to location on an uplifting coastline with a macrotidal range but showed vulnerability from human impacts and lower local community management capacity,academic
the most critical components to the vulnerability assessment were found to be exposure components of relative sea level trends and sediment supply and sensitivity components of forest health recent spatial changes and net accretion rates,academic
the results provide a baseline against which to establish long term ongoing monitoring allowing continued assessment of the complex dynamics of climate change impacts and providing an information base for strategic management decisions,academic
abstractthe devastating civil war that began in syria in march 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors,academic
the focus of the conflict is regime change but the triggers include a broad set of religious and sociopolitical factors the erosion of the economic health of the country a wave of political reform sweeping over the middle east and north africa mena and levant region and challenges associated with climate variability and change and the availability and use of freshwater,academic
as described here water and climatic conditions have played a direct role in the deterioration of syria s economic conditions,academic
there is a long history of conflicts over water in these regions because of the natural water scarcity the early development of irrigated agriculture and complex religious and ethnic diversity,academic
in recent years there has been an increase in incidences of water related violence around the world at the subnational level attributable to the role that water plays in development disputes and econom,academic
the literature on the potential impacts of climate change on the health of outdoor workers has received limited attention as a whole and in sub saharan african countries in particular,academic
yet substantial numbers of workers are experiencing the health effects of elevated temperature in combination with changes in precipitation patterns climate extremes and the effects of air pollution which have a potential impact on their safety and wellbeing,academic
with increased temperatures within urban settlements and frequent heats waves there has been a sudden rise in the occurrence of heat related illness leading to higher levels of mortality as well as other adverse health impacts,academic
this paper discusses the impacts of extreme heat exposure and health concerns among outdoor workers and the resultant impacts on their productivity and occupational safety in tropical developing countries with a focus on sub saharan africa where there is a dearth of such studies,academic
aside from the direct effects caused by extreme heat exposure other indirect health hazards associated with increasing heat among this group includes exposures to hazardous chemicals and other vector borne diseases,academic
in addition reduced work capacity in heat exposed jobs will continue to rise and hinder economic and social development in such countries,academic
there is an urgent need for further studies around the health and economic impacts of climate change in the workplace especially in tropical developing countries which may guide the implementation of the measures needed to address the problem,academic
climate change is a complex and cross cutting problem that needs an integrated and transformative systems approach to respond to the challenge,academic
current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development,academic
regional and international literature on climate change adaptation opportunities and challenges applicable to southern africa from a water energy food wef nexus perspective was reviewed,academic
specifically this review highlights climate change impacts on water energy and food resources in southern africa while exploring mitigation and adaptation opportunities,academic
the review further recommends strategies to develop cross sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient communities,academic
regional wef nexus related institutions and legal frameworks were also reviewed to relate the wef nexus to policy,academic
southern africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in climate change associated extreme weather events causing water food and energy insecurity,academic
a projected reduction of 20 in annual rainfall by 2080 in southern africa will only increase the regional socio economic challenges,academic
this is exacerbating regional resource scarcities and vulnerabilities,academic
it will also have direct and indirect impacts on nutrition human well being and health,academic
reduced agricultural production lack of access to clean water sanitation and clean sustainable energy are the major areas of concern,academic
the region is already experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases malaria and dengue fever and water and food borne diseases cholera and diarrhoea,academic
what is clear is that climate change impacts are cross sectoral and multidimensional and therefore require cross sectoral mitigation and adaptation approaches,academic
in this regard a well coordinated and integrated wef nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems harmonise interventions and mitigate trade offs and hence improve sustainability,academic
this would be achieved through greater resource mobilisation and coordination policy convergence across sectors and targeting nexus points in the landscape,academic
the wef nexus approach has potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in southern africa by contributing towards attaining the sustainable development goals sdgs 1 2 3 6 7 and 13,academic
the earth s climate is changing and increasing ambient heat levels are emerging in large areas of the world,academic
an important cause of this change is the anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases,academic
climate changes have a variety of negative effects on health including cardiac health,academic
people with pre existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease including heart failure people carrying out physically demanding work and the elderly are particularly vulnerable,academic
this review evaluates the evidence base for the cardiac health consequences of climate conditions with particular reference to increasing heat exposure and it also explores the potential further implications,academic
the likelihood of adverse health impacts from climate change is high,academic
actions to reduce emissions however not only mitigate climate change but often have more immediate health co benefits,academic
one substantial co benefit is gained through reductions of the high health costs of pollution from fossil fuel power stations particularly coal,academic
evidence indicates that the combustion of coal for electricity is responsible for over 200 000 deaths globally per year,academic
reducing such deaths is a health co benefit of greenhouse mitigation actions that promote renewable energy or energy efficiency,academic
together health co benefits of mitigation and the health risks of climate change strengthen the calls from climate action networks for cleaner energy production and for other initiatives to reduce greenhouse emissions,academic
the purpose of this scholarly review is to highlight the value of reframing climate change as a health issue to environmental movements and to environmental education and environmental education research,academic
the purpose is also to highlight the potential for further collaboration between formal and informal environmental educators researchers and the health professions,academic
health professionals and health educators would bring new voices for climate action to public and policy discourse as well as facilitate mitigation in their organisations and communities,academic
the future health costs associated with predicted climate change related events such as hurricanes heat waves and floods are projected to be enormous,academic
this article estimates the health costs associated with six climate change related events that struck the united states between 2000 and 2009,academic
the six case studies came from categories of climate change related events projected to worsen with continued global warming ozone pollution heat waves hurricanes infectious disease outbreaks river flooding and wildfires,academic
we estimate that the health costs exceeded 14 billion with 95 percent due to the value of lives lost prematurely,academic
actual health care costs were an estimated 740 million,academic
this reflects more than 760 000 encounters with the health care system,academic
our analysis provides scientists and policy makers with a methodology to use in estimating future health costs related to climate change and highlights the growing need for public health preparedness,academic
the rapid rise in extreme heat events in australia recently is already taking a health toll,academic
climate change scenarios predict increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events in the future and population health may be significantly compromised for people who cannot reduce their heat exposure,academic
exposure to extreme heat presents a health hazard to all who are physically active particularly outdoor workers and indoor workers with minimal access to cooling systems while working,academic
at air temperatures close to or beyond the core body temperature of 37 c body cooling via sweating is essential and this mechanism is hampered by high air humidity,academic
heat exposure among elite athletes and the military has been investigated whereas the impacts on workers remain largely unexplored particularly in relation to future climate change,academic
workers span all age groups and diverse levels of fitness and health status including people with higher than normal sensitivity to heat,academic
in a hotter world workers are likely to experience more heat stress and find it increasingly difficult to maintain productivity,academic
modeling of future climate change in australia shows a substantial increase in the number of very hot days 35 c across the country,academic
in this article the authors characterize the health risks associated with heat exposure on working people and discuss future exposure risks as temperatures rise,academic
progress toward developing occupational health and safety guidelines for heat in australia are summarized,academic
forecasting the impacts of climate change on aedes borne viruses especially dengue chikungunya and zika is a key component of public health preparedness,academic
we apply an empirically parameterized bayesian transmission model of aedes borne viruses for the two vectors aedes aegypti and ae,academic
albopictus as a function of temperature to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates and compare with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models gcms,academic
our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperatures for transmission 26 29 c we can expect poleward shifts in aedes borne virus distributions,academic
however the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change,academic
more severe climate change scenarios produce proportionally worse population exposures from ae,academic
aegypti but not from ae,academic
albopictus in the most extreme cases,academic
expanding risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will likely be a serious problem even in the short term for most of europe but significant reductions are also expected for aedes albopictus most noticeably in southeast asia and west africa,academic
within the next century nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to both aedes spp,academic
in the worst case scenario but massive net losses in risk are noticeable for ae,academic
albopictus especially in terms of year round transmission marking a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions,academic
many other complicating factors like mosquito range limits and viral evolution exist but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to both increased and new exposures to vector borne disease the most extreme increases in ae,academic
albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios,academic
author summary the established scientific consensus indicates that climate change will severely exacerbate the risk and burden of aedes transmitted viruses including dengue chikungunya zika west nile virus and other significant threats to global health security,academic
here we show that the story is more complicated first and foremost due to differences between the more heat tolerant aedes aegypti and the more heat limited ae,academic
almost a billion people could face their first exposure to viral transmission from either mosquito in the worst case scenario especially in europe and high elevation tropical and subtropical regions,academic
on the other hand while year round transmission potential from ae,academic
aegypti is likely to expand especially in south asia and sub saharan africa ae,academic
albopictus loses significant ground in the tropics marking a global shift towards seasonal risk as the tropics eventually become too hot for transmission by ae,academic
complete mitigation of climate change to a pre industrial baseline could protect almost a billion people from arbovirus range expansions but middle of the road mitigation may actually produce the greatest expansion in the potential for viral transmission by ae,academic
in any scenario mitigating climate change also shifts the burden of both dengue and chikungunya and potentially other aedes transmitted viruses from higher income regions back onto the tropics where transmission might otherwise start to be curbed by rising temperatures,academic
the objectives of the study were to consider the potential health impacts in australia and the region arising from changes in air quality occurring as a result of climate change identify vulnerable groups and potential adaptation measures and discuss the implications for policy,academic
the authors provide an overview of international and national information on the potential health impacts of air pollutants that would most likely be affected by climate change and a discussion of the policy implications,academic
climate change is likely to have an impact on levels of ozone and possibly particulates both of which are associated with increased mortality and a range of respiratory and cardiovascular health effects,academic
one of the implications is therefore a possible increase in adverse health effects due to air pollutants,academic
regional health impact assessments of climate change should address the issue of air quality consider current coping capacity and determine the need for adaptation particularly for vulnerable groups,academic
implications for policy include the need for improved modeling and forecasting of air pollutant levels increased efforts to reduce emissions of air pollutants continued monitoring of air pollutant levels and monitoring of the incidence of health effects associated with air pollutants in all countries in the region,academic
the environmental effects assessment panel eeap is one of three panels of experts that inform the parties to the montreal protocol,academic
the eeap focuses on the effects of uv radiation on human health terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems air quality and materials as well as on the interactive effects of uv radiation and global climate change,academic
when considering the effects of climate change it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held,academic
because of the montreal protocol there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa are not yet fully understood,academic
some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of uv radiation while other areas will likely experience a reduction in uv radiation as ozone and climate driven changes affect the amounts of uv radiation reaching the earth s surface,academic
like the other panels the eeap produces detailed quadrennial reports every four years the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 photochem,academic
2015 14 1 184,academic
in the years in between the eeap produces less detailed and shorter update reports of recent and relevant scientific findings,academic
the most recent of these was for 2016 photochem,academic
2017 16 107 145,academic
the present 2017 update report assesses some of the highlights and new insights about the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of uv radiation atmospheric processes and climate change,academic
a full 2018 quadrennial assessment will be made available in 2018 2019,academic
background population health is a primary goal of sustainable development,academic
united nations international conferences like the beijing platform for action have highlighted the key role of women in ensuring sustainable development,academic
in the context of climate change women are affected the most while they display knowledge and skills to orient themselves toward climate adaptation activities within their societies,academic
objective to investigate how the gender perspective is addressed as an issue in research and policy making concerning climate change and global health,academic
methods a broad literature search was undertaken using the databases pubmed and web of science to explore the terms climate change health gender and policy,academic
climate change and health related policy documents of the world health organization who and national communications and national adaptation programs of action reports submitted to the united nations framework convention on climate change of selected countries were studied,academic
assessment guidelines to review these reports were developed from this study s viewpoint,academic
results the database search results showed almost no articles when the four terms were searched together,academic
the who documents lacked a gender perspective in their approach and future recommendations on climate policies,academic
the reviewed un reports were also neutral to gender perspective except one of the studied documents,academic
conclusion despite recognizing the differential effects of climate change on health of women and men as a consequence of complex social contexts and adaptive capacities the study finds gender to be an underrepresented or non existing variable both in research and studied policy documents in the field of climate change and health,academic
background climate change has emerged as one of the most devastating environmental threat and there is overwhelming evidence of wide range of implications for human health,academic
to mitigate this well prepared medical man power is required,academic
objectives the objectives of this study were 1 to assess the awareness regarding climate change and its health hazards among the medical students and 2 to recommend the awareness campaigns regarding climate change and its health hazards for students based on the results,academic
settings and design this observational study was conducted at the medical college in pune city,academic
materials and methods medical students from all years of m,academic
bachelor of medicine and bachelor of surgery who had given the written consent were included in this study,academic
a self administered pre tested questionnaire was used,academic
responses were evaluated,academic
statistical analysis used proportions percentage and chi square test,academic
results a total of 250 medical students were included in this study,academic
in all 246 98,academic
40 students commented that global climate is changing while 245 98 students opined that human activities are contributing to climate change,academic
the commonest source of information about climate change was newspaper and magazines 78,academic
majority commented that deforestation and industrial and vehicular pollution contribute most to climate change,academic
according to 47,academic
50 of the students health related issues are priority for climate change prevention strategy,academic
according to 65,academic
10 students direct physical hazards of extreme climatic events are most important health related impact of climate change followed by natural disaster related health hazards 43,academic
50 waterborne diseases 27,academic
60 vector borne diseases 17,academic
60 and malnutrition 10,academic
there was statistically significant difference found between year of mbbs of the students and the awareness regarding united nations federation on climate change kyoto protocol χ2 7,academic
85 p 0,academic
02 and intergovernmental panel on climate change χ2 12,academic
77 p 0,academic
a significant difference was found between the awareness about health impact of climate change at different places χ2 11,academic
25 p 0,academic
conclusion students had awareness regarding health hazards of the climate change but improvement for mitigation is required,academic
it is suggested that a large nation wide awareness survey regarding climate change and its health hazards is necessary to determine the preparedness of medical students and also to suggest any changes in the current curriculum,academic
climate change is a major challenge to arctic and other indigenous peoples but not the only and often not the most pressing one,academic
we propose re framing the treatment of climate change in policy and research to make sure health poverty education cultural vitality equity justice and other topics highlighted by the people themselves and not just climate science also get the attention they deserve in research on global and regional environmental change,academic
climate change can often exacerbate other problems but a singular focus on climate change as is often the case in much existing environmental literature on the arctic and elsewhere can distract from actions that can be taken now to improve the lives of arctic peoples,academic
the same logic also applies elsewhere in the world where diverse residents face a host of challenges opportunities and obstacles with climate change but one among many issues,academic
our proposed approach to regional and global environmental change research draws on the ideas of decolonization emphasizing collaborative approaches and indigenous voices in research and policy instead of top down measures designed outside the affected communities,academic
only in this way of contextualizing human environmental experiences can the full effects of climate change be understood and appropriate responses developed and carried out to adapt to global change,academic
nutritious safe affordable and enjoyable food is a fundamental prerequisite for health,academic
as a nation australia is currently classified as food secure with the domestic production exceeding domestic consumption of most major food groups,academic
the domestic system is almost self sufficient in terms of nutritious plant foods although these foods have seen steady higher price increases relative to other foods with nutrition equity implications,academic
however the viability of australia s food security sits counter to the continued presence of a stable and supportive climate,academic
this article reviews the current state of science concerning the interface between climate change food systems and human health to reveal the key issues that must be addressed if australia is to advance human health and sustainable food systems under a changing climate,academic
climate change is exacerbating climate variability evident in more frequent and severe weather related disasters such as droughts fires and floods,academic
most of what is known about the possible effects of climate change on rural mental health relates to prolonged drought,academic
but though drought is known to be a disproportionate and general stressor evidence is mixed and inconclusive,academic
over time like drought other weather related disasters may erode the social and economic bases on which farming communities depend,academic
rural vulnerability to mental health problems is greatly increased by socioeconomic disadvantage,academic
related factors may compound this such as reduced access to health services as communities decline and a stoical culture that inhibits help seeking,academic
australia has the world s most variable climate and is a major global agricultural producer,academic
yet despite australia s and especially rural communities dependence on farmers well being and success there is very little and inconclusive quantitative evidence about farmers mental health,academic
the aim of this review is to consider with a view to informing other countries how climate change and related factors may affect farmers mental health in australia,academic
that information is a prerequisite to identifying selecting and evaluating adaptive strategies to lessen the risks of adverse mental health outcomes,academic
the authors identify the need for a systematic epidemiology of the mental health of farmers facing increasing climate change related weather adversity,academic
climate change presents unprecedented health risks and demands universal attention to address them,academic
multiple intergovernmental organizations health associations and health professions schools have recognized the specific importance of preparing physicians to address the health impacts of climate change,academic
however medical school curricula have not kept pace with this urgent need for targeted training,academic
the authors describe the rationale for inclusion of climate change in medical education and some potential pathways for incorporating this broad topic into physician training and continuing medical education,academic
reasons include the magnitude and reach of this transboundary issue the shared responsibility of the u,academic
health care sector as a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions and the disproportionate effects of climate change on vulnerable populations,academic
the integration of climate change related topics with training of essential physician skills in a rapidly changing environment is feasible because many health topic areas already exist in medical school curricula in which climate change education can be incorporated,academic
to fully integrate the health topics underlying concepts and the needed clinical and system wide translations content could be included across the scope of training and into continuing medical education and faculty development,academic
the authors provide examples of such an approach to curricular inclusion,academic
this study extends the emerging body of research on farmer adaptation to climate change by segmenting farmers on the basis of specific attributes health values belief about climate change sense of responsibility for climate change desire to change social human and financial capitals and farmer demographics and considering such attributes as critical social aspects of the contextualized capacity to adapt,academic
the segmental analysis was based on a nationally representative sample of 3 993 farmers concerned with farmer adaptation of climate risks,academic
the resulting data were subjected to two step cluster analysis to identify homogenous groups of farmers based on factors related to climate change adaptation,academic
a three cluster solution was identified wherein farmers were distinguishable on the basis of belief in climate change desire for financial assistance and advice social connectedness information seeking and adverse farm conditions,academic
the largest group cluster 1 55 was characterized by farmers who recognized being affected by drought and drying and who were actively engaged in adaptive practices despite the fact that they had little income and poor farm resources,academic
one third of these farmers reported that their health was a barrier to sustained activity in farming,academic
cluster 2 26 was characterized by farmers not readily affected by drying who enjoyed good incomes good health and better farming conditions,academic
they expressed little desire to adapt,academic
the smallest cluster cluster 3 19 was also characterized by farmers who recognized that they were affected by drying,academic
however despite a desire to adapt they had very little means to do so,academic
they reported the poorest natural resources and the poorest health despite being younger,academic
the findings suggest that it is the intent to adapt starting from where people are at which is a more important indicator of the capacity to work towards sustainable practices than assets tests alone,academic
purpose of review to present the latest data that demonstrate how climate change affects children s health and to identify the principal ways in which climate change puts children s health at risk,academic
recent findings data continue to emerge that further implicate climate change as contributing to health burdens in children,academic
climate models have become even more sophisticated and consistently forecast that greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher mean temperatures that promote more intense storms and droughts both of which have profound implications for child health,academic
recent climate models shed light upon the spread of vector borne disease including lyme disease in north america and malaria in africa,academic
modeling studies have found that conditions conducive to forest fires which generate harmful air pollutants and damage agriculture are likely to become more prevalent in this century due to the effects of greenhouse gases added to earth s atmosphere,academic
summary through many pathways and in particular via placing additional stress upon the availability of food clean air and clean water and by potentially expanding the burden of disease from certain vector borne diseases climate change represents a major threat to child health,academic
pediatricians have already seen and will increasingly see the adverse health effects of climate change in their practices,academic
because of this and many other reasons pediatricians have a unique capacity to help resolve the climate change problem,academic
climate change is predicted to have a major impact on people s lives with the recent extreme weather events and varying abnormal temperature profiles across the world raising concerns,academic
the impacts of global warming are already being observed from rising sea levels and melting snow and ice to changing weather patterns,academic
scientists state unequivocally that these trends cannot be explained by natural variability in climate alone,academic
human activities especially the burning of fossil fuels have warmed the earth by dramatically increasing concentrations of heat trapping gases in the atmosphere as these concentrations increase the more the earth will warm,academic
climate change and related extreme weather events are being exacerbated sooner than has previously been considered and are already adversely affecting ecosystems and human health by increasing the burden and type of disease at a local level,academic
changes to the marine environment and freshwater supplies already affect significant parts of the world s population and warmer temperatures especially in more temperate regions may see an increased spread and transmission of diseases usually associated with warmer climes including for example cholera and malaria these impacts are likely to become more severe in a greater number of countries,academic
this review discusses the impacts of climate change including changes in infectious disease transmission patterns of waterborne diseases and the likely consequences of climate change due to warmer water drought higher rainfall rising sea levels and flooding,academic
kiribati a low lying resource poor pacific atoll nation is one of the most vulnerable countries in the world to the impacts of climate change including the likely detrimental effects on human health,academic
we describe the preparation of a climate change and health adaptation plan for kiribati carried out by the world health organization and the kiribati ministry of health and medical services including an assessment of risks to health sources of vulnerability and suggestions for highest priority adaptation responses,academic
this paper identifies advantages and disadvantages in the process that was followed lays out a future direction of climate change and health adaptation work in kiribati and proposes lessons that may be applicable to other small developing island nations as they prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change on health,academic
the paris agreement binds all nations to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change with the commitment to hold warming well below 2 c in global mean temperature gmt relative to pre industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1,academic
5 c limit constitutes an ambitious goal for which greater evidence on its benefits for health would help guide policy and potentially increase the motivation for action,academic
here we contribute to this gap with an assessment on the potential health benefits in terms of reductions in temperature related mortality derived from the compliance to the agreed temperature targets compared to more extreme warming scenarios,academic
we performed a multi region analysis in 451 locations in 23 countries with different climate zones and evaluated changes in heat and cold related mortality under scenarios consistent with the paris agreement targets 1,academic
5 and 2 c and more extreme gmt increases 3 and 4 c and under the assumption of no changes in demographic distribution and vulnerability,academic
our results suggest that limiting warming below 2 c could prevent large increases in temperature related mortality in most regions worldwide,academic
the comparison between 1,academic
5 and 2 c is more complex and characterized by higher uncertainty with geographical differences that indicate potential benefits limited to areas located in warmer climates where direct climate change impacts will be more discernible,academic
purpose urban landscapes play a significant role in supporting municipal ecological and social systems,academic
besides valuable environmental services and urban green spaces provide social and psychological services very important for the liveability of modern cities and the well being of urban residents,academic
it is clear that the area of green space in a city the method of designing urban landscape and access to urban green space potentially affect the health happiness comfort safety and security of urban dwellers,academic
urban landscape plays a significant role in providing habitats for wildlife and an important vegetation type in doing this is species rich herbaceous vegetation that provides pollen and nectar plus physical habitat for native fauna,academic
any factor that makes an impression on the urban landscape such as climate change will affect people s lives directly or indirectly,academic
there is a universal consensus that the temperature has increased in most of the world over the past century the investigation of climate change impacts on the urban landscape is the purpose of this study,academic
findings understanding the process of climate change adaptation is necessary to design plant communities for use in public landscapes,academic
increased co2 and air temperature in conjunction with the changing rainfall conditions as the three important factors of climate change potentially alter almost all world ecosystems,academic
climate change provides new opportunities and in some cases an obligate need to use non native plant species in conjunction with native plant species not only to reduce the side effects of climate change but also to increase the species diversity and aesthetic value in meadow like naturalistic planting design,academic
originality value the authors confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere,academic
in this paper the authors report on the effects of climate change on urban landscape and suggest different kind of solutions to reduce the effects,academic
the paper should be of interest to readers in the areas of landscape architecture landscape ecologist landscape planner landscape managers and environmental designer,academic
the world health organization who has identified climate change as one of the greatest health threats of the 21st century and air pollution as the single largest environmental health risk,academic
1 at the same time noncommunicable diseases constitute the largest and fastest growing global health burden with treatment costs placing a massive strain on government and individual resources,academic
the scaling up of international commitment on noncommunicable diseases over the past decade had initially focused on four risk factors tobacco use the harmful use of alcohol unhealthy diet and physical inactivity,academic
exposure to each of these risks has a strong element of personal choice with the responsibility often placed on individual rather than on broader societal responses,academic
however these risks are also strongly affected by social determinants including commodity prices production methods marketing and social norms and in the case of activity levels the physical environment,academic
a range of other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases are even more strongly linked to environmental exposures and to climate change,academic
therefore together climate change air pollution and noncommunicable diseases represent one of the most serious threats to global health,academic
many of the same development patterns that lead to high reliance on fossil fuels as well as policies and technological choices that are driving climate change such as polluting transport and energy choices are also worsening air pollution and other environmental exposures,academic
these exposures have a direct and strong influence on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases,academic
the most obvious is air pollution,academic
indoor and outdoor air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million deaths a year2 and comes second to tobacco as a risk factor for noncommunicable diseases,academic
air pollution has therefore been identified as the fifth major risk factor in the latest political declaration of the united nations general assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases,academic
the effects of air pollution on health show that noncommunicable diseases are not exclusively due to lifestyle or personal choices as is commonly perceived,academic
recommendations to stay indoors avoid walking along particularly polluted streets or to wear facemasks during episodes of high exposure to air pollution illustrate the inadequacy of individual responses to a broad and serious problem,academic
the ultimate causes of air pollution and therefore of a large proportion of the noncommunicable disease burden are the energy sources that currently drive our transport electricity generation industry and food production systems,academic
the connection between the sources of local air pollution and the emissions that drive climate change is very clear,academic
estimations show that approximately 25 of urban ambient air pollution from fine particulate matter pm2,academic
5 is contributed by traffic 15 by industrial activities including electricity generation 20 by domestic fuel burning with a remaining 22 from unspecified sources of human origin and 18 from natural sources,academic
3 exposure to indoor air pollution is mostly due to the use of solid fuels for cooking in low income households,academic
4 such exposure causes almost 4 million deaths a year of which almost 3 million are due to noncommunicable diseases such as lung cancer chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ischaemic heart disease and stroke,academic
for comparison the international panel on climate change estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by transport 14 energy including generation of electricity and heat 35 industry 21 buildings 6 and agriculture and land use change 24,academic
5 the sources of climate change and air pollution and therefore a large part of the noncommunicable disease burden are broadly the same polluting energy systems,academic
some of the same pollutants contribute both to climate change and local ambient and household air pollution,academic
black carbon produced by inefficient combustion in sources such as cookstoves and diesel engines is the second greatest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide,academic
5 black carbon is also a significant contributor between 5 and 15 of urban exposure to pm2,academic
the second largest contributor to global warming is methane which reacts with other pollutants to form ozone and is responsible for 230 000 chronic respiratory disease deaths globally each year,academic
6 both of these pollutants are short lived in the atmosphere meaning that targeting them for removal would have immediate beneficial effects on both climate change and noncommunicable diseases such as stroke and deaths from cardiovascular disease,academic
a set of 16 practical interventions from replacing polluting cookstoves with cleaner household energy solutions to replacing the most polluting diesel fuels and engines with less polluting ones would prevent approximately 0,academic
5 c of global warming and save some 2,academic
5 million lives a year by 2050,academic
7 other opportunities are available improving energy efficiency and insulation in houses in temperate climates therefore reducing mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in winter transitioning from polluting solid fuels to clean and sustainable energy in low income households therefore reducing deaths from indoor air pollution adopting reliable renewable energy in health care facilities not connected to electricity grids therefore allowing refrigeration of medical supplies and lighting for essential services,academic
8 in the transport sector an accelerated transition from diesel and petrol engines to electric powered vehicles would contribute to reducing emissions of local air pollutants and greenhouse gas,academic
much greater health gains however would result from replacing short urban car journeys with walking and cycling climate change air pollution and noncommunicable diseases diarmid campbell lendrum annette prüss ustün,academic
background the most direct way in which climate change is expected to affect public health relates to changes in mortality rates associated with exposure to ambient temperature,academic
many countries worldwide experience annual heat related and cold related deaths associated with current weather patterns,academic
future changes in climate may alter such risks,academic
estimates of the likely future health impacts of such changes are needed to inform public health policy on climate change in the uk and elsewhere,academic
methods time series regression analysis was used to characterise current temperature mortality relationships by region and age group,academic
these were then applied to the local climate and population projections to estimate temperature related deaths for the uk by the 2020s 2050s and 2080s,academic
greater variability in future temperatures as well as changes in mean levels was modelled,academic
results a significantly raised risk of heat related and cold related mortality was observed in all regions,academic
the elderly were most at risk,academic
in the absence of any adaptation of the population heat related deaths would be expected to rise by around 257 by the 2050s from a current annual baseline of around 2000 deaths and cold related mortality would decline by 2 from a baseline of around 41 000 deaths,academic
the cold burden remained higher than the heat burden in all periods,academic
the increased number of future temperature related deaths was partly driven by projected population growth and ageing,academic
conclusions health protection from hot weather will become increasingly necessary and measures to reduce cold impacts will also remain important in the uk,academic
the demographic changes expected this century mean that the health protection of the elderly will be vital,academic
small scale farmers are highly threatened by climate change,academic
experts often base their interventions to support farmers to adapt to climate change on their own perception of farmers livelihood risks,academic
however if differences in risk perception between farmers and experts exist these interventions might fail,academic
thus for effective design and implementation of adaptation strategies for farmers it is necessary to understand farmers perception and how it influences their decision making,academic
we analyze farmers and experts systemic view on climate change threats in relation to other agricultural livelihood risks and assess the differences between their perceptions,academic
for cauca colombia we found that experts and farmers perceived climate related and other livelihood risks differently,academic
while farmers perceived risks were a failure in crop production and lack of access to health and educational services experts in contrast perceived insecurity and the unreliable weather to be the highest risks for farmers,academic
on barriers that prevent farmers from taking action against risks experts perceived both external factors such as the national policy and internal factors such as the adaptive capacity of farmers to be the main barriers,academic
farmers ranked the lack of information especially about weather and climate as their main barrier to adapt,academic
effective policies aiming at climate change adaptation need to relate climate change risks to other production risks as farmers often perceive climate change in the context of other risks,academic
policymakers in climate change need to consider differences in risk perception,academic
abstract climate change is increasingly recognized as one of the greatest threats to human health of the 21st century with consequences that mental health professionals are also likely to face,academic
while physical health impacts have been increasingly emphasized in literature and practice recent scholarly literature indicates that climate change and related weather events and environmental changes can profoundly impact psychological well being and mental health through both direct and indirect pathways particularly among those with pre existing vulnerabilities or those living in ecologically sensitive areas,academic
although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and mental health evidence is indicating that impacts may be felt at both the individual and community levels with mental health outcomes ranging from psychological distress depression and anxiety to increased addictions and suicide rates,academic
drawing on examples from diverse geographical areas this article highlights some climate sensitive impacts that may be encountered by mental health professionals,academic
we then suggest potential avenues for public mental health in light of current and projected changes in order to stimulate thought debate and action,academic
climate change and health inequities represent two of the greatest challenges to human development in the 21st century,academic
as the copenhagen summit on climate change planned for december 2009 approaches there are opportuni ties to use the political momentum of climate change to promote health equity,academic
the broad ranging policies re quired to address climate change have both positive and negative implications for health and health equity,academic
climate change will have far reaching implications for inuit health,academic
focusing on adaptation offers a proactive approach for managing climate related health risks one that views inuit populations as active agents in planning and responding at household community and regional levels,academic
adaptation can direct attention to the root causes of climate vulnerability and emphasize the importance of traditional knowledge regarding environmental change and adaptive strategies,academic
an evidence base on adaptation options and processes for inuit regions is currently lacking however thus constraining climate policy development,academic
in this article we tackled this deficit drawing upon our understanding of the determinants of health vulnerability to climate change in canada to propose key considerations for adaptation decision making in an inuit context,academic
climate change has been described as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century,academic
the atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide have increased significantly since the start of the industrial era around 1750 with much of this increase occurring over just the last 50 years or so,academic
this is resulting in warming of the climate system as well as changes in precipitation and weather and climate extremes,academic
these changes in climate are having wide ranging impacts on the earth s physical biological and human systems including human health,academic
it is these impacts of climate change on human health that are the focus of this paper particularly the impacts on allergens and allergic diseases,academic
such impacts are particularly significant in many countries where the prevalence of such diseases is high and or increasing,academic
there is now compelling evidence that rising air temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations are in some plant species resulting in increased pollen production and allergenicity and advancement and lengthening of the pollen season,academic
changes in extreme events such as thunderstorms and tropical cyclones will also have impacts on allergic diseases with for example the flooding associated with tropical cyclones leading to proliferation of mould growth in damp homes,academic
the article also considers a range of responses to these health threats including greenhouse gas mitigation and adaptation strategies such as enhanced environmental monitoring and health surveillance and adequate planning for the future medical workforce,academic
purpose the purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of climate change on economic development in bangladesh,academic
more specifically the research aims to figure out the influence of climate change on gross domestic product gdp growth rate related to different sectors such as agriculture forest water health and infrastructure,academic
it also attempts to explore the effect of climate change on the coastal economy of bangladesh,academic
design methodology approach a set of statistical and econometric techniques including descriptive and correlation analysis and time series regression model was applied to address the objective of the research,academic
sector wise time series economic data were collected from the world bank for the period between 1971 and 2013,academic
climate data were received from the bangladesh agricultural research council online database for the period between 1948 and 2013,academic
findings the results from the statistical analysis show that climate variables such as temperature and rainfall have changed between 1948 and 2013 in the context of bangladesh,academic
the econometric regression analysis demonstrates that an increase by 1 c of annual mean temperature leads to a decrease in the gdp growth rate by 0,academic
44 per cent on average which is statistically significant at the 5 per cent level,academic
on the other hand the estimated coefficients of agriculture industry services urbanization and export are positively associated with gdp growth rate and these are statistically significant at the 1 per cent level,academic
sector wise correlation analysis provides statistical evidence that climate change is negatively associated with various sectors such as agriculture forest human health and arable land,academic
in contrast it has a positive relation to water access and electricity consumption,academic
analysis of coastal regions shows that climate change negatively affects the local economic sectors of the coastal zone of the country,academic
originality value although this study has received significant insight from the world renowned research publication the economics of climate change the stern review there is a dearth of research on the economic impact of climate change in the context of bangladesh,academic
the findings of the paper provide deep insight into and comprehensive views of policy makers on the impact of climate change on economic growth and various sectors in bangladesh,academic
there is near unanimous scientific consensus that the world s climate is changing and most of the warming is attributable to human activities,academic
over the past few decades economic expansion of china the largest developing country has been one of the strongest in world history,academic
such an economic expansion however is largely driven by fossil fuels which leads to dramatic increases in emissions of greenhouse gases ghgs,academic
although emissions per person in china are at the global average china surpassed the united states as the country emitting the most carbon dioxide co2 in 2007 international energy agency 2009,academic
china is also a large emitter of methane and black carbon the other two major contributors to global warming,academic
as in other parts of the world china has experienced noticeable changes in climate over the past 100 years national development and reform commission 2007,academic
the annual average air temperature has risen by 0,academic
8 c which is slightly higher than the average global temperature increase and most of these changes have been observed over the past 50 years,academic
regional distribution of temperature changes shows that the warming trend was more significant in western eastern and northern china than in southern china,academic
seasonal distribution of the temperature changes shows that the most significant temperature increase occurred in winter,academic
the trend of climate warming in china is projected to intensify in the future,academic
the chinese government has paid great attention to climate change but so far there has been limited focus on climate related the health impacts,academic
evidence is mounting that climate change has already affected human health directly and indirectly in china including mortality from extreme weather events changes in air and water quality and changes in the ecology of infectious diseases zhang et al,academic
the observed relationship between temperature and daily mortality among chinese residents has been generally j or u shaped with mortality risk decreasing from the lowest temperature to an inflection point and then increasing with higher temperature kan et al,academic
heat waves and other extreme weather conditions have been associated with increased death risk in large chinese cities such as beijing and shanghai,academic
elevated mortality during temperature extremes has been attributed mainly to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases especially among the elderly,academic
however little information is available in china on possible modifiers of the health impact of thermal extremes such as preexisting health status and population demographics,academic
improvement of living conditions resulting from rapid economic development in china can reduce heat wave related heath impacts,academic
in shanghai for example heat waves in 1998 and 2003 both led to increased mortality,academic
although the heat waves in these 2 years were similar in meteorological characteristics elevated mortality was much less pronounced during the 2003 event suggesting that adaptations to climate change e,academic
increased use of air conditioners larger living spaces increased urban green space higher levels of heat awareness implementation of a heat warning system issued by local meteorological stations can reduce health risks imposed on chinese residents tan et al,academic
the health impacts of high temperatures and severe air pollution may interact and are thus worthy of attention because outdoor air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges for public health in chinese cities,academic
in wuhan an oven city because of its hot summers high temperatures enhanced the effect of particulate matter 10 μm pm10 on cardiopulmonary mortality even though pm10 concentrations were lower on days with extremely high temperatures than on days with normal and low temperatures qian et al,academic
also levels of some secondary air pollutants such as ozone are affected by temperature and tend to be higher on hot days,academic
epidemiological evidence from chinese cities has indicated significant risks of ozone associated with increasing temperatures zhang et al,academic
climate change may lead to a wide range of extreme weather events in china including typhoons floods blizzards windstorms drought and landslides,academic
the direct and indirect health effects due to these extreme events are important but are difficult to assess at present,academic
climate change can also affect climate sensitive infectious diseases carried by animal hosts or vectors in china these include schistosomiasis japanese encephalitis dengue fever malaria and angiostrongylus cantonensis infection,academic
for example schistosomiasis is one of the vector borne diseases that received little attention for many years but the impact of climate change on its transmission has recently attracted attention and debate,academic
in a recent study zhou et al,academic
2010 found that as winter temperatures continue to rise due to global warming oncomelania hupensis the intermediate host of schistosoma japonicum in china may increase its range thereby spreading schistosomiasis to the northern part of china,academic
china is striving to quadruple its gross domestic product gdp of the year 2000 by 2020 and consequently will face even more serious challenges in controlling emission of ghgs,academic
the anthropogenic contribution to ghgs is largely caused by the same activity that causes air pollution so if china acts to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant air pollution it will reap not only the health benefits associated with improvement of air quality but also the climate change benefits,academic
therefore these air pollution related health benefits might be a strong inducement for the chinese government to act to combat climate change,academic
in short there is sufficient evidence showing that climate change has posed health risks to chinese populations,academic
future research will need to provide methods of adapting to climate change and evaluate the implementation of adaptation measures improve characterization of climate health relationships particularly at regional levels identify thresholds and particularly vulnerable groups and collect and enhance long term surveillance data on health issues of potential concern including morbidity due to temperature extremes vector borne diseases air quality pollen and mold counts food borne and waterborne diseases and mental health impacts from extreme weather events,academic
finally ghg emissions need to be controlled,academic
concern about the health impacts of climate change can encourage the chinese government to take appropriate action,academic

reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport food and energy use choices can result in very large gains for health particularly through reduced air pollution,institutional
climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health,institutional
it affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems,institutional
it is therefore a threat multiplier undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress,institutional
as climatic conditions change more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed including storms extreme heat floods droughts and wildfires,institutional

climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage uhc,institutional
more fundamentally climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns drought floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health,institutional
all aspects of health are affected by climate change from clean air water and soil to food systems and livelihoods,institutional
further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks undermine decades of improvements in global health and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all,institutional
the intergovernmental panel on climate change s ipcc sixth assessment report ar6 concluded that climate risks are appearing faster and will become more severe sooner than previously expected and it will be harder to adapt with increased global heating,institutional

in vulnerable regions the death rate from extreme weather events in the last decade was 15 times higher than in less vulnerable ones,institutional
climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events such as heatwaves storms and floods the disruption of food systems increases in zoonoses and food water and vector borne diseases and mental health issues,institutional
furthermore climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health such as livelihoods equality and access to health care and social support structures,institutional

climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly and is strongly mediated by environmental social and public health determinants,institutional
although it is unequivocal that climate change affects human health it remains challenging to accurately estimate the scale and impact of many climate sensitive health risks,institutional
however scientific advances progressively allow us to attribute an increase in morbidity and mortality to global warming and more accurately determine the risks and scale of these health threats,institutional

however modelling challenges persist especially around capturing risks like drought and migration pressures,institutional
the climate crisis threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress in development global health and poverty reduction and to further widen existing health inequalities between and within populations,institutional
it severely jeopardizes the realization of uhc in various ways including by compounding the existing burden of disease and by exacerbating existing barriers to accessing health services often at the times when they are most needed,institutional
over 930 million people around 12 of the world s population spend at least 10 of their household budget to pay for health care,institutional
with the poorest people largely uninsured health shocks and stresses already currently push around 100 million people into poverty every year with the impacts of climate change worsening this trend,institutional
in the short to medium term the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation,institutional
in the longer term the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points,institutional

rising freshwater like lake surface temperatures from climate change are likely to increase the prevalence of harmful algae pathogens and bacteria,institutional
these can be a risk when those waters are used for recreation swimming drinking and potentially food fish or agriculture,institutional
actions needed health environment and climate change are intertwined 11,institutional
despite evidence of the effect of environment and climate on health political action and investments remain largely insufficient only about 3 of health resources are invested in prevention with approximately 97 spent on treatment increasing healthcare costs,institutional
a more preventive integrated and intersectoral approach to enhancing health fostering pro poor growth and protecting the environment should promote policy coherence more sustainable consumption efficiency and equity,institutional
the healthcare community needs to mobilise at all levels to gather data act fast and engage with the environment and climate change agenda for the good of a vast number of human lives public health systems need to be strengthened to protect against climate change and enhance its capacity to manage emergencies for the benefit of individuals and communities especially the less advantaged surveillance and early warning systems can protect in advance of disaster striking solutions for climate change environment and health 13,institutional

based on what you hear from young people like yourself are there any new health issues in your community that you think are linked to what is happening to the environment,institutional
we talk a lot right now about climate anxiety for example,institutional
the mental health aspect of climate change stands out to me most,institutional
as young people we don t get enough information about what is getting done regarding climate change and we worry about our future and the future of the next generations,institutional
many are dealing with mental health struggles as they are forced to move from the places where they were born and used to live because of rising sea levels or depleting natural resources,institutional
we do not know what our lives will look like even in 5 to 10 years,institutional
this needs to change,institutional
how should we explain the urgency behind advocating for environment and health issues together,institutional
if we fail to mitigate the impact of climate change on health we will see a lot of health problems emerging and resurfacing which will inevitably affect our life expectancy and quality of life,institutional
heat related illnesses infectious diseases a spike in chronic lung conditions such as asthma caused by worsened air quality malnutrition especially in areas where access to clean water and food is scarce and a lack of resources in hospitals to treat such patients to name a few,institutional
i would urge world leaders to take bold actions within climate change negotiations and consider the health implications of climate change in the decision making process to create a healthy world for all of us,institutional
they must understand how climate change directly impacts health outcomes because our future depends on the actions they take today to protect our planet and our people,institutional
how do you overcome stereotypes about young people s lack of capacity to meaningfully contribute their knowledge and expertise,institutional
a lot of young people including myself have imposter syndrome we know we have a valuable opinion but very few listen to us because we are too young or don t have enough experience,institutional
we often hear that we don t know how the world works but this is exactly what we re trying to change,institutional
in this context i m reminding myself not to lose focus,institutional
that s why building communities of like minded people like the one we have in youth4health is so important where we can inspire and support each other,institutional
joining such networks and organizations helps you see that you can bring new valuable ideas that adults didn t even think of,institutional
it starts with one person who believes in you which in turn motivates you to achieve new heights,institutional
yes we will still have those days of helplessness and we will still ask ourselves if our work actually makes a difference but it does,institutional
we have to accept that things will not change in seconds days or months but taking consistent small steps every day can spark bigger changes,institutional
how can we ensure that young people are really heard and seen in international health forums and at all levels of health decision making,institutional
it is essential to participate in conversations with them strategically and consistently not just as a one time event,institutional
this is why it is vital for us as young activists to have who support,institutional
when national governments see who endorse the youth4health network and youth led initiatives and events they listen to us and discover that we have much to offer,institutional
what s your take on young people s role in bringing health topics to climate negotiations like cop29,institutional
how can this be done,institutional
cop29 is an amazing opportunity to push policy makers to include health in climate negotiations,institutional
as youth we have to be present at cop29 talk about connection between climate change and health and represent not just youth voices but the voices of the future generations,institutional
we should be vocal and use social media advocacy to spread awareness about this topic and the challenges climate change creates for public health,institutional
in addition youth presence at cop29 is crucial because this is a platform to form coalitions with ngos nongovernmental organizations health and climate experts and activists passionate about this topic,institutional
as long as more people join our cause our voice will be heard and we can have a stronger impact on the results of these negotiations,institutional
and how are you planning to use the budapest youth declaration for your campaigning and advocacy,institutional
this is the document everyone can consult to understand young people s opinions on this topic,institutional
it is a young people s manifesto urging world leaders to prioritize health in climate change negotiations,institutional
it also lays out what we as young people commit to doing and what we expect from others,institutional
the declaration is very concise and precise,institutional
at cop29 we can definitely use it to highlight what young people want in climate policies and what concrete actions we should take to achieve a healthier and more sustainable future for us and future generations,institutional
this tool positions our youth organizations and networks as a force to be reckoned with,institutional
can you tell us more about the european environment and health process ehp partnership on youth,institutional
this is our effort to involve young people in developing and implementing policies that address environment and health issues,institutional
as part of this mechanism they collaborate with governments on concrete projects and raise youth organizations profiles as credible partners,institutional
in my view the most important thing about the ehp partnership on youth is balance in our rules we encourage member states from the who european region to join together with youth organizations from their country so that there isn t one side whose voice outweighs all others,institutional
to apply member states can send an email request to info yho,institutional
the ehp partnership on youth is very horizontal and enables youth to get involved in a variety of topics around climate and health,institutional
for example members can choose a topic they want to work on together when they join and our role is to facilitate this collaboration and youth involvement at all levels of such discussions,institutional
and what kind of support do you think young people and youth organizations need to feel empowered to keep up their work,institutional
what do you think is required from governments and society at large on different levels,institutional
the main thing is just getting involved if not in large scale political debates then even in the smallest events at the local level,institutional
amplifying youth voices should become a whole of society priority as our impact increases with numbers,institutional
collaboration between organizations is key in my home country lithuania we set up youth groups to gather multiple perspectives on a specific topic across different youth coalitions and form a unified stance,institutional
yes we will not get everything just because there are so many of us and many aspects to consider but at least we will get the bigger picture a small change that makes a huge difference,institutional
we still have to somehow push our opinion and ask to be invited to major events,institutional
we have already seen how governments and international organizations like who are starting to involve youth in discussions of policies or new research,institutional
but we certainly are eager to have more of them support our cause,institutional
are there any positive breakthroughs that give you hope and desire to keep up this great work raising awareness about meaningful youth engagement at this interview is already a positive change,institutional
however i d also like to mention the community engagement component and increased cross sectoral collaboration,institutional
for example i am currently part of the youth technical advisory board at the sustainaware climate action going digital project,institutional
we re creating an online escape room to help our peers understand how climate and health are interconnected through experiential learning,institutional
i m giving something back to the community so that they can boost their knowledge while also making personal connections with people from different sectors,institutional
i hope that people who are now involved in health advocacy will continue in the future and become the new leaders of our world,institutional
climate change refers to long term shifts in temperatures and weather patterns,institutional
such shifts can be natural due to changes in the sun s activity or large volcanic eruptions,institutional
but since the 1800s human activities have been the main driver of climate change primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal oil and gas,institutional
burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the earth trapping the sun s heat and raising temperatures,institutional
the main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane,institutional
these come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building for example,institutional
clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide,institutional
agriculture oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions,institutional
energy industry transport buildings agriculture and land use are among the humans are responsible for global warming for virtually all global heating over the last 200 years,institutional
human activities like the ones mentioned above are causing greenhouse gases that are warming the world faster than at any time in at least the last two thousand years,institutional
the average temperature of the earth s surface is now about 1,institutional
2 c warmer than it was in the late 1800s before the industrial revolution and warmer than at any time in the last 100 000 years,institutional
the last decade 2011 2020 was the warmest on record and each of the last four decades has been warmer than any previous decade since 1850,institutional
many people think climate change mainly means warmer temperatures,institutional
but temperature rise is only the beginning of the story,institutional
because the earth is a system where everything is connected changes in one area can influence changes in all others,institutional
now include among others intense droughts water scarcity severe fires rising sea levels flooding melting polar ice catastrophic storms and declining biodiversity,institutional
people are experiencing climate change in diverse ways ability to grow food housing safety and work,institutional
some of us are already more vulnerable to climate impacts such as people living in small island nations and other developing countries,institutional
conditions like sea level rise and saltwater intrusion have advanced to the point where whole communities have had to relocate and protracted droughts are putting people at risk of famine,institutional
in the future the number of people displaced by weather related events is expected to rise,institutional
thousands of scientists and government reviewers agreed that limiting global temperature rise to no more than 1,institutional
5 c would help us avoid the worst climate impacts and maintain a livable climate,institutional
yet policies currently in place point to the emissions that cause climate change come from every part of the world and affect everyone but some countries produce much more than others,institutional
the six biggest emitters china the united states of america india the european union the russian federation and brazil together accounted for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023,institutional
by contrast the 45 least developed countries accounted for only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions,institutional
everyone must take climate action but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first,institutional
we face a huge challenge but already know many solutions many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment,institutional
we also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress such as the un framework convention on climate change,institutional
three broad categories of action are cutting emissions adapting to climate impacts and financing required adjustments,institutional
switching energy systems from fossil fuels to will reduce the emissions driving climate change,institutional
but we have to act now,institutional
while a growing number of countries is committing to to keep warming below 1,institutional
achieving this means huge declines in the use of coal oil and gas production and consumption of all fossil fuels need to by 2030 in order to prevent catastrophic levels of climate change,institutional
to climate consequences protects people homes businesses livelihoods infrastructure and natural ecosystems,institutional
it covers current impacts and those likely in the future,institutional
adaptation will be required everywhere but must be prioritized now for the most vulnerable people with the fewest resources to cope with climate hazards,institutional
the rate of return can be high,institutional
early warning systems for disasters for instance save lives and property and can deliver benefits up to we can pay the bill now or pay dearly in the future by governments and businesses,institutional
but climate inaction is vastly more expensive,institutional
one critical step is for developed countries to support developing countries so they can adapt and move towards greener economies,institutional
to get familiar with some of the more technical terms used in connection with climate change consult the climate change is a hot topic with myths and falsehoods circulating widely,institutional
find some essential facts fossil fuels are by far the largest contributor to the greenhouse gas emissions that cause climate change which poses many risks to all forms of life on earth,institutional

climate change and malaria a complex relationship,institutional
climate change is defined as a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability persisting for an extended period typically decades or longer that may be attributed to natural internal processes external forcing or persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use,institutional
malaria the world s most important and deadly tropical mosquito borne parasitic disease kills approximately 1 million people and afflicts as many as 1 billion people in 109 countries throughout africa asia and latin america,institutional
reducing the impact of malaria will significantly enhance the efforts to achieve the millennium development goals agreed upon by every united nations member state,institutional
variation in climatic conditions such as temperature rainfall patterns and humidity has a profound effect on the longevity of the mosquito and on the development of malaria parasites in the mosquito and subsequently on malaria transmission,institutional
the global temperature has risen significantly over the past 100 years with an accelerated warming trend since the mid 1950s,institutional
elementary modelling suggests that this increase will enhance the transmission rates of mosquito borne disease and widen its geographical distribution with an increase in malaria in particular being identified as a potential impact of climate change,institutional
while some studies report an increase in the spread of the disease in the current malaria endemic areas or a reemergence of the disease in areas which have controlled transmission or eliminated the disease in the past others report no association between malaria and climate change,institutional
historically malaria was endemic in europe including scandinavia but was eliminated in 1975 despite the increase in global temperature due to better socio economic conditions improved irrigation and drainage adoption of new farming methods behavioural changes and access to better health care,institutional
due to the complex relationship between malaria and climate change gaps in knowledge still exist in the mechanisms of the linkage,institutional
climate change will increase the opportunities for malaria transmission in traditionally malarious areas in areas the disease has been controlled as well as in new areas which have been traditionally non malarious,institutional
an increase in temperature rainfall and humidity may cause a proliferation of the malaria carrying mosquitoes at higher altitudes resulting in an increase in malaria transmission in areas in which it was not reported earlier,institutional
at lower altitudes where malaria is already a problem warmer temperatures will alter the growth cycle of the parasite in the mosquito enabling it to develop faster increasing transmission and thus having implications on the burden of disease,institutional
climate change greatly influences the el niño cycle that is known to be associated with increased risks of some diseases transmitted by mosquitoes such as malaria dengue and rift valley fever,institutional
in dry climates heavy rainfall can provide good breeding conditions for the mosquitoes,institutional
increased humidity droughts may turn rivers into strings of pools the preferred breeding sites of mosquitos,institutional
in some areas heavy rainfall can wash out the breeding sites and reduce the incidence of malaria,institutional
in colombia and venezuela malaria cases increased by more than one third following dry conditions associated with el niño,institutional
in sri lanka before the use of ddt a synthetic agricultural pesticide used in controlling malarial life cycle the risk of malaria increased three fold following the failure of monsoons which were also associated with el niño,institutional
in southern africa countries have recently experienced malaria epidemics following unusual rainfall,institutional
western and north western india recorded more malaria cases with higher rainfall during la niña in 1996 and less rain and fewer malaria cases in the same area during el niño in 1998,institutional
in short the changes in the el niño cycle have the ability to increase the malariogenic potential resulting in malaria epidemics,institutional
it may not be possible to quantify how climate change affects malaria transmission which depends on many factors such as population and demographic dynamics drug resistance insecticide resistance human activities such as deforestation irrigation swamp drainage etc,institutional
and their impact on the local ecology,institutional
further other impacts of climate change may cause increased susceptibility to malaria,institutional
for example negative impacts on health which could contribute to social degradation and economic loss may result in the inability to seek early diagnosis and treatment or impair control activities such as insecticidal spraying thereby increasing transmission of the disease,institutional
the economics of decreasing malaria transmission by mitigating climatic changes via carbon dioxide emissions versus using other methods have been modelled,institutional
it is estimated that for the cost of saving one life by cutting down on carbon 78 000 lives may be saved annually by using mosquito nets environmentally safe indoor ddt sprays and subsidies for effective new combination therapies,institutional
surveillance and preparedness have been major components of the malaria control strategy adopted since 1992 by the world health organization who,institutional
in addition to early diagnosis and prompt effective treatment selective vector control and capacity building to prevent epidemics and control transmission have been the other areas of focus,institutional
the emergence of three innovations in dipsticks for diagnosis artemisinins for treatment of malaria and insecticide treated nets for prevention of transmission in the 1990s coupled with new initiatives such as the roll back malaria initiative of who the establishment of the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria as well as the inclusion of malarial indicators in the millennium development goals has led to a renewed interest in malaria control,institutional
all these efforts ensured that surveillance including early detection and prompt treatment of cases and capacity building together with preparedness were given priority,institutional
the elimination of malaria from selected countries is stated explicitly in the targets of the global malaria action plan,institutional
considerable progress has been achieved in malaria elimination in some countries during the past few years,institutional
by 2015 at least eight to ten countries currently in the elimination stage are expected to achieve zero incidence of locally transmitted infection,institutional
beyond 2015 countries currently in the pre elimination stage are expected to move into the elimination phase,institutional
consistent with the goals of the global malaria action plan as of 2009 three countries that were in the elimination phase armenia egypt and turkmenistan have reported no locally acquired cases for more than three years and have moved into the phase of prevention of reintroduction,institutional
six countries azerbaijan georgia kyrgyzstan tajikistan turkey and uzbekistan all from the who european region had moved from the pre elimination stage to a nationwide elimination approach by 2009,institutional
climate change would perhaps increase the epidemic potential of malaria in tropical countries currently susceptible to the disease,institutional
increasing temperatures and global travel have the potential to reintroduce or increase transmission of malaria in tropical and temperate countries that have either eliminated or controlled transmission,institutional
such countries would be prone to epidemics since surveillance and preparedness for malaria control may not be as intense as when malaria was a major public health problem in these countries,institutional
it is in this context that surveillance and preparedness need to be emphasized not compromised,institutional
this is especially true in developing countries that have to balance competing interests for scarce resources some of which need not necessarily be health related,institutional
let s not forget the setbacks of the eradication era which showed much promise in the initial phases but had to be abandoned later the classic example being the near elimination of malaria from sri lanka in 1963,institutional
the pattern of response to hiv aids and climate change a commentary,institutional
almost three decades into the hiv aids pandemic there is still widespread stigma denial and government inaction,institutional
there are reports of rising rates of infection in the western industrialized nations and concerns about the possibility of explosive epidemics in the asian block yet sub saharan africa with less than 15 per cent of the world s population remains at the epicentre of the epidemic with over 70 per cent of the infections worldwide,institutional
given the amount of time and energy devoted to aids it is sobering to ask why this should be the case,institutional
starting with the world health organization s global programme on aids which developed into the joint united nations programme on hiv aids unaids there has been almost since the start of the epidemic a very high level globalized response biannual international aids conferences which attract over 10 000 people regional aids conferences and many related conferences on drug use sexuality and public health a un general assembly special session in 2001 regional government meetings resulting in declarations and statements of intent a range of donors funding hiv aids related work around the world and a seemingly endless range of training manuals for education prevention community care and support gender equity treatment and care,institutional
high level meetings are held to ensure that governments are held accountable and that populations are able to respond effectively,institutional
prominent people are asked to endorse campaigns be tested for the virus disclose their status and lead the fight against hiv aids as well as aids related stigma and discrimination,institutional
and yet despite all this energy dedication and commitment in many parts of the world infection rates are rising communities are dealing with high numbers of death and suffering families are affected by the death of young people and millions of youth face an uncertain future due to the death of their parents siblings and relatives,institutional
the provision of treatments seemed to herald a new era in hiv aids and drugs have been promoted as the best option for prevention,institutional
today as the expected success of voluntary counselling testing and treatments has not materialized there is the push for male circumcision and for an end to concurrency in sexual relationships,institutional
hiv aids is one of the most fascinating social issues of our time,institutional
it has bred in the existing fault lines of society and exposed new ones,institutional
old tensions in society that have been tolerated or hidden have been exposed,institutional
the reality of gender inequality and patriarchy and the abuse and exploitation of young people have been exposed the lack of food housing education health care and access to medications have been exposed,institutional
the pandemic has also starkly highlighted the inequality as well as the hypocrisy of societies and global political relationships,institutional
hiv aids has in many instances shown how difficult it is to make democracy and accountability effective how culture and cultural practices collude with the epidemic and fuel it and how corruption permeates through all societies whether rich or poor,institutional
the pandemic has opened a new form of neo colonialism as donors and un agencies patronize the developing world about bad governance and offer technical support and funding,institutional
un agencies and many donors are however caught in a bind,institutional
they want an effective global response but they also have to recognize that it may fail precisely because a global response oversimplifies the pandemic and the societies that suffer from it,institutional
often these outside groups define not only the pandemic but also the societies in which they are working,institutional
they tend to frame the pandemic in generalized ways giving money for specific projects that they alone define evaluate and lead and which they believe best suit the people living in that society,institutional
these interventions may indeed mitigate the present situation and may also lead to some long term social and political changes but they cannot address the root causes of poverty and disease which are deeply ingrained in post colonial heritage international political relationships entrenched global inequality and a failure to respect human rights,institutional
the hiv aids pandemic grows from and contributes to poverty hunger exploitation migration lack of education and a failure of political will and imagination,institutional
in most cases the reaction to the pandemic has been to describe what is and to find attempts to manage the existing status quo and protect it from anticipated effects,institutional
rather our reaction should be to actively seek out what could be and find ways to challenge and change the status quo into a future that looks at new social community and family formations new ways of understanding sexuality and human rights,institutional
we are seeing exactly the same patterns of response to climate change which are the consequences of a lack of social and political integrity in the dominant world economic and political order,institutional
just like hiv aids climate change has attracted many nations and the un to develop protocols and adopt declarations,institutional
people are exhorted to change their behaviour with dire warnings and predictions of calamities,institutional
the spread of hiv aids and the impact of climate change have many things in common,institutional
people with the least amount of resources are affected most,institutional
there is also a lack of political will and the technical capabilities to contain either calamity,institutional
third even if people are included in mitigation decisions will be made for and about them,institutional
communities often cannot act on declarations and protocols because in reality they are unable to carry out the good intentions of the policy makers,institutional
fourth just as hiv aids exacerbates poverty gender vulnerability exploitation of children and access to health care so too may climate change heighten social dislocations,institutional
many people migrating from oppressive regimes and poverty seeking a better life may be joined by climate refugees and wealthy nations may find ways to deny them entry,institutional
like with hiv aids people are looking for ways to protect and strengthen the status quo from the impact of climate change rather than creating a fundamentally changed world with an intellectual curiosity that will allow us to devise new ways of living,institutional
in large measure the inability to stem the spread of hiv aids and deal effectively with pressing social and health needs has come about because of a lack of emphasis on good research,institutional
social science research was needed so that we could understand the effects of race class culture and gender in societies in which the epidemic was playing itself out,institutional
impetus on social research has been swept aside in the need for quick fix solutions and for governments to preserve existing political relationships as we know them,institutional
hiv aids and climate change may radically and fundamentally alter the world and yet we cling to the existing world order without investing the time and money to foster critical research into the issues that both the epidemic and global warming raise,institutional
we seek easy solutions and lock complex issues into neatly packaged sound bites and politically correct clichés,institutional
we have not produced critical insights into how diverse societies and power operate and we have not produced viable and innovative ways in which political systems might change,institutional
beyond the declarations and the rhetoric there needs to be good critical stimulating research in both fields that will allow societies to imagine a new challenging and attainable future,institutional
just as we need to think ahead to tackle the fall out from hiv aids we need to think quicker than climate change,institutional

it is shocking that in the 21st century any child still goes hungry uneducated or without even the most basic healthcare un secretary antónio guterres said in his world children s day message,institutional
it is a stain on humanity s conscience when children s lives are caught in the grinding wheels of poverty or upended by disasters,institutional
climate emergency threatens lives in a stark warning the report reveals children will face eight times more exposure to extreme heatwaves and triple the risk of extreme river floods compared to the 2000s,institutional
following 2023 s record breaking temperatures projected climate hazards will disproportionately affect children based on their socioeconomic settings and access to resources,institutional
children are experiencing a myriad of crises from climate shocks to online dangers and these are set to intensity in the years to come warned unicef executive director catherine russell,institutional
creating a better future in 2050 requires more than just imagination it requires action,institutional
decades of progress particularly for girls are under threat,institutional
shifting demographics the report also projects significant population changes with sub saharan africa and south asia hosting the largest child populations by the 2050s,institutional
while still high africa s child population will drop below 40 per cent down from 50 per cent in 2000s,institutional
east asia and western europe s data show a 17 per cent drop compared to 29 perc cent and 20 percent for those regions during the 2000s,institutional
these demographic shifts create challenges with some countries under pressure to expand services for large child populations while others balance the needs of a growing elderly population,institutional
digital divide while artificial intelligence and frontier technologies offer new opportunities the report reveals the digital gap remains stark in 2024 over 95 percent of people in high income countries have internet access compared to merely 26 percent in low income countries,institutional
the report notes that youth in developing countries particularly struggle to access digital skills impacting their educational and workplace prospects,institutional
signs of hope despite these concerns some positive trends have emerged,institutional
life expectancy at birth continues to rise and nearly 96 per cent of children globally are expected to receive primary education by the 2050s,institutional
increased investment in education and public health and more stringent environmental protection could narrow the gender gap and reduce exposure to environmental hazards the report reveals,institutional
unicef recommends urgent investment in education services and sustainable and resilient cities for children,institutional

it will then fall to around 10,institutional
2 billion which is 700 million lower than expected a decade ago,institutional
that s just one of the key findings revealed in thursday s world population prospects 2024 report published by the un thursday,institutional
however changes in global population are uneven and the demographic landscape is evolving with rapid population growth in some places and rapid ageing in others making reliable population data more important than ever said the un sexual and reproductive health agency unfpa heralding the report which is published to coincide with world population day,institutional
the report must be used to reach and respond to the needs of those who have been left behind the agency added,institutional
everyone counts marking the international day un secretary general antónio guterres said it was key to accurately count everyone because everyone counts,institutional
our rich human tapestry is only as strong as its weakest thread,institutional
when data and other systems work for those on the margins they work for everyone,institutional
this is how we accelerate progress for all,institutional
to study this population data more closely the 28th edition of world population prospects wpp published by the un department of economic and social affairs desa since 1951 provides the latest demographic data for 237 countries from 1950 to 2024 and projections up to the year 2100,institutional
the wpp is crucial to monitor the sustainable development goals with about a quarter of the indicators relying on its data,institutional
lower fertility an ageing population the world s overall fertility rates are dropping with women having one child fewer on average than they did around 1990,institutional
in more than half of all countries and areas the average number of live births per woman is below 2,institutional
1 the level required for a population to maintain a constant size,institutional
meanwhile nearly a fifth of all countries and areas including china italy the republic of korea and spain now have ultra low fertility with fewer than 1,institutional
4 live births per woman over a lifetime,institutional
reaching the peak as of 2024 population size has peaked in 63 countries and areas including china germany japan and the russian federation and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14 per cent over the next thirty years,institutional
the average age of the population of the world is also increasing,institutional
by the late 2070s the number of persons 65 years or older is projected to surpass the number of persons under 18,institutional
this is in part due to the overall increase in life expectancy and decrease in mortality rates over the past three decades,institutional
by the late 2050s more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher a substantial increase from 17 per cent in 1995,institutional
rapid growth while the slow growth or decline of populations is occurring mainly in high income countries rapid population growth will occur in low income and lower middle income countries,institutional
specifically angola the central african republic the democratic republic of congo niger and somalia very rapid growth is projected with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054,institutional
this population growth will increase demand for resources especially in sub saharan africa and south asia and combined with poorly managed urbanisation and rising living standards it will worsen environmental impacts,institutional
climate change a major challenge affects these countries the most where many rely on agriculture and food insecurity is prevalent,institutional
in countries including india indonesia nigeria pakistan and the united states population is also expected to increase through 2054 and could potentially peak in the second half of the century or later,institutional
reproductive health central to population and development is the recognition that women s sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are cornerstones of sustainable development said secretary general guterres,institutional
particularly in low income countries early pregnancies remain a challenge,institutional
in 2024 4,institutional
7 million babies or about 3,institutional
5 per cent of the total worldwide were born to mothers under the age of 18,institutional
of these some 340 000 were born to children under 15 with serious consequences for the health and well being of both the young mothers and their children,institutional
investing in the education of young people especially girls and increasing the ages of marriage and first childbearing in countries where these have an early onset will have positive outcomes for women s health educational attainment and labour force participation according to wpp data,institutional
these efforts will also contribute to reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind,institutional
un reviews progress and challenges 30 years after landmark population conference,institutional
dennis francis was speaking at an event to mark the 30th anniversary of the international conference on population and development held in cairo,institutional
the landmark conference concluded with a programme of action adopted by 179 governments that put reproductive rights gender equality and the empowerment of women girls and young people at the heart of development,institutional
uneven progress mr,institutional
francis pointed to significant advances and progress made since then particularly in the areas of poverty reduction life expectancy and food security,institutional
maternal deaths have declined he said while access to primary education has expanded for both girls and boys,institutional
but we must also admit that progress has been uneven both within and among countries he said as climate change conflict and other crises have jeopardised many of these hard won gains,institutional
nevertheless the visionary objectives outlined in the programme of action have only grown in importance he added noting their connection to the global push to achieve sustainable development for all by 2030,institutional
support women and girls we must certainly do much more to acknowledge that empowered women and girls children and others in vulnerable situations are central for peaceful prosperous and sustainable societies and proactively do much more to support and facilitate them in the full realisation of their potential he said,institutional
as many of the challenges that have hampered implementation of the programme of action persist mr,institutional
francis urged countries to find fresh innovative ways to both address and overcome them,institutional
and let us rededicate ourselves in earnest to a shared future of peace prosperity progress and sustainability for all with all everywhere he concluded,institutional

missing the mark while great progress has been made over the past three decades she said many countries are still falling short of life expectancy targets and many developing countries face significant challenges in achieving the sdg target on child mortality,institutional
additionally 164 million women of reproductive age worldwide have no access to family planning services,institutional
while all countries are on the path towards longer lives and smaller families some continue to face the challenges of rapid population growth,institutional
others are grappling with the consequences of population ageing sometimes population decline,institutional
and we see our health systems struggling she said,institutional
push back against pushbacks ms,institutional
mohammed underlined the need for countries to fully recognise the megatrends that are reshaping the world today such as climate change demographic shifts and urbanisation and their critical connections to the sdgs,institutional
we must remain vigilant and continue to address situations where sexual and reproductive health and rights are being rolled back she said,institutional
we must respond and push back when women s rights are being eroded and when migrants and other vulnerable populations are mistreated,institutional
she urged the international community to continue to uphold the dignity of all people ensuring that no one is left behind and to support rights based approaches in our population and development policies,institutional
47 million health workers and advocates call for cleaner air to curb pollution deaths,institutional
the second who global conference on air pollution and health co hosted by the world health organization and colombia in the city of cartagena brought together over 700 participants from 100 countries including heads of state ministers scientists and civil society groups to accelerate action to curb what s increasingly described as a full scale health emergency,institutional
it is time to move from commitments to bold actions said tedros adhanom ghebreyesus who director general,institutional
to achieve clean air we need urgent actions on all fronts financial investment in sustainable solutions such as in clean energy and sustainable transport technical enforcement of who global air quality guidelines and social commitment to protect the most vulnerable in our most polluted regions,institutional
the shared goal,institutional
a 50 per cent reduction in the health impacts of air pollution by 2040,institutional
countries including brazil spain china and the united kingdom laid out national roadmaps while the clean air fund pledged an additional 90 million for climate and health programmes,institutional
cities which are part of the c40 network including london vowed to strengthen air quality monitoring and push for greater investment in clean air strategies,institutional
a health crisis hidden in plain sight according to who air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths annually and is now the second leading global risk factor for disease after hypertension,institutional
today air pollution is the first risk factor for disease burden said maria neira who s director of environment climate change and health,institutional
it s the number one risk factor for getting sick,institutional
the burden is heaviest in countries with fast growing cities and weak regulatory frameworks,institutional
neira pointed out that the economic costs and health toll are rising globally,institutional
those chronic diseases are costing us well to our health system and to our hospitals she said,institutional
despite the grim statistics who leaders say solutions are at hand,institutional
neira cited china s progress in cutting emissions while continuing to grow economically,institutional
at one point they demonstrated that you can reduce air pollution while still maintaining economic growth she said,institutional
this argument that in order to tackle the causes of climate change air pollution and environmental health you need to invest and you don t obtain benefits immediately that s not correct,institutional
climate and health emergency indeed air pollution is not just a public health issue but a key driver and symptom of the climate crisis,institutional
the burning of fossil fuels which feeds air pollution also releases greenhouse gases adding to global warming,institutional
climate change causes and air pollution causes overlap said ms,institutional
we have a lot to gain for health for the economy and for society sustainable development if we accelerate this transition,institutional
she emphasized that clean air solutions including renewable energy better urban design and phasing out fossil fuels also serve as climate mitigation strategies,institutional
this pollution this particulate matter we are breathing every day is coming from different sources but fundamentally from the combustion of fossil fuels she said,institutional
this can be avoided only by accelerating the transition to more renewables cleaner sources of energy,institutional
examples from colombia and europe hosts colombia presented a slate of national initiatives including cleaner fuels zero emission public transit and a target to reduce carbon emissions 40 per cent by 2030,institutional
air pollution claims more victims than violence itself,institutional
poisoning our air costs lives in silence this conference reinforces our determination to implement policies for both the environment and the health of our people said colombia s president gustavo petro,institutional
he stressed the importance of smarter regulation and bridging the inequality gap with indigenous peoples local and rural communities,institutional
in europe where air pollution still causes 300 000 premature deaths annually lawmakers are moving toward stricter regulation,institutional
pollution is an invisible pandemic,institutional
it is a slow motion pandemic underscored javier lópez vice president of the european parliament s environment committee,institutional
the european union recently adopted a new air quality directive halving legal air pollution thresholds and aiming to reduce pollution related deaths by 30 per cent by 2030,institutional
we have decided to come up with the air quality directive which is part of the european green package mr,institutional
regional model global lessons officials from the united nations economic commission for europe unece also took part in cartagena highlighting the convention on long range transboundary air pollution as one of the most successful multilateral environmental agreements to date,institutional
the air convention is a multilateral environmental agreement that was adopted in 1979 to address air pollution that crosses national borders said policy officer carolin sanz noriega,institutional
since its adoption the convention has expanded to 51 parties and achieved deep emissions cuts across the region,institutional
reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide nitrogen oxides by 40 to 80 from 1990 levels in the unece region and for more than 30 for particulate matter ms,institutional
sanz noriega said,institutional
she emphasized that the agreement s success lies in its binding commitments robust science and long standing trust building mechanisms,institutional
countries implement the convention because it really brings benefits,institutional
it brings health benefits environmental benefits crop benefits,institutional
it has co benefits for climate,institutional
through the forum for international cooperation on air pollution unece is now working with countries in latin america africa and asia to share scientific tools and regulatory approaches,institutional
but a major challenge especially in the global south remains technical capacity,institutional
we need to make sure that the countries are able to monitor air quality,institutional
that s the first step ms,institutional
in africa unfortunately we are still missing a lot of monitoring capacity you cannot manage what you cannot measure,institutional
prescribing clean air the health sector provided one of the key takeaways of the conference,institutional
with millions of medical professionals and individuals already backing the who campaign delegates emphasized that clean air must be recognized as central to disease prevention,institutional
we have 47 million signatures from health professionals from patients from advocates from institutions saying i want to prescribe clean air ms,institutional
i don t want to treat the patients with diseases caused by exposure to toxic air,institutional
i want to make sure that my patients will not be exposed and therefore they will not develop those diseases,institutional
as the conference wrapped up delegates left cartagena emboldened with new partnerships data and policy options but also a resounding moral imperative,institutional
the time to generate evidence on air pollution has passed underscored ms,institutional
we have a lot of it,institutional
no one can say anymore that they didn t know,institutional
the lifelong impacts of climate change on people and what we can do about them climate shocks can have lifelong consequences including on education,institutional
since 2022 400 million students globally have experienced school closures due to extreme weather events,institutional
copyright arne hoel world bank we explored the crucial role of investing in human capital our health knowledge and skills in addressing the climate crisis,institutional
today we examine how climate change affects us from birth to old age profoundly shaping our lives and communities,institutional
imagine a baby enduring a heat wave or a child missing school due to flooding,institutional
these events can have lifelong consequences affecting health education income and overall well being,institutional
at the world bank s human capital project our team is dedicated to understanding these challenges and identifying innovative solutions to protect people at every stage of life,institutional
climate and development brief delivering for people and the planet,institutional
world bank group 2022,institutional
how does climate change affect us throughout the life cycle,institutional
climate change has lasting impacts on health outcomes starting as early as in utero,institutional
it increases mortality rates and causes permanent cognitive and educational setbacks among infants and young children,institutional
higher temperatures and changing weather patterns are projected to result in over 21 million additional deaths linked to five major health related issues by 2050 with infants being the most affected,institutional
a key factor in this is the increased prevalence of vector borne diseases and reduced access to clean water,institutional
for instance flooding in bangladesh has been linked to higher rates of stunting in children due to increased water borne diseases,institutional
working in extreme heat doubles the risks associated with pregnancy,institutional
extreme weather events also hinder pregnant women from accessing medical care leading to higher rates of newborn deaths and low birth weights,institutional
climate shocks disrupt education for school age children and potentially cost them opportunities over their lifetime,institutional
events like flooding or cyclones prevent children from attending school and limit their access to healthcare,institutional
in for example flooding destroyed over 500 schools in one year drastically affecting children s education,institutional
and climate highlights that these disruptions are more widespread than previously thought,institutional
since 2022 a staggering 400 million students globally have experienced school closures due to extreme weather events,institutional
the impacts are most severe in low and middle income countries where education systems are already vulnerable to climate shocks,institutional
these short term events can have longer term impacts,institutional
many kids do not return to school after the shock subsides,institutional
a striking graph illustrates how flooding in latin america can significantly reduce education especially for children who are not yet in school during the flood,institutional
the legacy of natural disasters the intergenerational impact of 100 years of disasters in latin america climate change reduces productivity and earnings for working age adults,institutional
over the last 60 years rising temperatures lengthened the transition season for malaria increasing by 32 in the americas and 14 in highlands africa,institutional
this surge in disease especially among vulnerable workers leads to higher absenteeism and decreased productivity,institutional
as working age adults work less and are not as productive they earn less income and face increased poverty,institutional
this graph clearly illustrates how extreme heat reduces productivity with earnings lost to heat as a share of gdp across different regions and industrial sectors,institutional
agricultural workers in poorer regions like africa and south east asia are the most affected,institutional
climate change poses significant health risks for older adults,institutional
heat waves are particularly dangerous for older adults,institutional
in comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of daily mean apparent temperature what the temperature feels like to the human body reveals an increase in mortality for those over 65,institutional
the elderly have higher rates of preexisting health conditions and mobility challenges making it difficult to evacuate during disasters and recover afterward,institutional
poor health also heightens the risks of illness from worsening air quality,institutional
in outdoor air pollution has been shown to decrease cognitive function especially among elderly women in urban areas,institutional
investing in human capital across all ages to address climate change impacts combatting climate change and building resilience across all life stages is crucial,institutional
the world bank s human capital project works to generate evidence and knowledge to help identify country specific needs and inform investments,institutional
this involves systematically assessing climate related vulnerabilities in developing countries focusing on impacts on lives livelihoods and economies and identifying best buys for climate and human capital investments,institutional
here are some examples of world bank programs addressing risks for specific age groups cash and in kind transfers are vital for protecting human capital from the impacts of climate shocks such as food insecurity and lost income,institutional
the is a lifeline to many providing regular cash transfers to over 90 000 households and maintaining a social registry with information on 300 000 potentially vulnerable households,institutional
when the 2022 lean season hit the government quickly reached an additional 70 000 food insecure households,institutional
these transfers ensure families can provide adequate nutrition and healthcare directly supporting the healthy development of young children,institutional
integrating climate resilience into school infrastructure and curricula can also protect education outcomes,institutional
nigeria s adolescent girls initiative for learning and empowerment invests in constructing climate resilient energy efficient and eco friendly schools,institutional
these schools feature adaptations like rainwater harvesting structures to combat both immediate climate shocks such as floods and long term trends related to water availability,institutional
additionally the program offers digital literacy and remote learning ensuring education continues even during climate disruptions,institutional
in response to climate change impacts on the agricultural system the government of in collaboration with the world bank has developed initiatives to build a more resilient agricultural sector ensuring that working age adults can maintain stable incomes and contribute to the country s food security and economic growth,institutional
as climate related health risks rise it s crucial to protect the most vulnerable populations including the elderly,institutional
a new aims to improve healthcare infrastructure and services ensuring elderly individuals receive the care they need during climate induced health crises,institutional
this is the second blog in series that showcases recent world bank research to explore how human capital is critical for climate resilience adaptation and action,institutional
check out the first blog we are especially grateful to gabriel demombynes dani clark jing guo christina nelson and sarah eleuterio comer for their insightful feedback and valuable comments on this blog,institutional

when climate becomes a health issue how vulnerable is bangladesh,institutional
life for people living in the jalekhali village of the sathkira district in has not been the same since cyclone aila made landfull in 2009,institutional
in this coastal village not only did people suffer in the aftermath of the cyclone but health effects still linger from salinity intrusion into their ponds and other bodies of water,institutional
in addition to an increase incidence of water borne diseases among women and children the increased intake of salt has resulted in increased prevalence of high blood pressure among pregnant women,institutional
the issue but is prevalent across coastal towns and villages in bangladesh,institutional
in many of these villages the ground well water is also contaminated with arsenic leaving the people with acute shortage of safe drinking water,institutional
bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world,institutional
it is already facing enormous challenges due to extreme events such as droughts land and coastal flooding and other unusual weather events,institutional
added to these challenges are the demographic and socio economic shifts such as rapid population growth and fast uneven urbanization,institutional
while bangladesh has made great strides in health indicators increased life expectancy at birth continued decline in child and maternal mortalities climate change could become a hurdle in achieving the desired health outcomes as it is expected to increase the burden of diseases both in terms of increased morbidity and mortality,institutional
climate change and health impacts how vulnerable is bangladesh and what needs to be done,institutional
the study assesses the national vulnerability and impact on major diseases of increased climate variability and extreme events in bangladesh,institutional
the study also looked at the existing institutional and implementation capacity the financial resources at the national and local levels and existing public programs targeted at climate sensitive diseases,institutional
the innovation in the study is that it looks at the effects of climate change on health after accounting for confounding factors such as location economic wellbeing and access to electricity water healthcare and sanitation,institutional
it allows us to identify the most vulnerable populations and the effects that different climatic factors have on their health,institutional
three key messages emerge from this study first the health impacts of increased climate variability and extreme weather events are projected to be significant by 2050 but well targeted development investments to where they are most needed and the ones that are most cost efficient can mitigate the excess health burden and related economic costs attributable to climate change,institutional
second rapid urbanization migration and a growing urban slum population are quickly changing the population dynamics in bangladesh and this has implications for climate induced health risks,institutional
third different climatic factors create different effects and confounding factors such as where someone lives their economic well being along with access to water electricity sanitation and healthcare all impact vulnerability,institutional
the allocation of public resources to deal with climate health risks in the future should therefore be optimally targeted to reach the most vulnerable locations that are likely to be climate health hotspots with high climate and health risks in the most cost effective manner,institutional
overall climate change could impose a considerable additional health burden on the society which will fall disproportionately on the vulnerable poorer groups of population having lower abilities to adapt to the health risks of climate change,institutional
the study furthers the understanding of the health impacts of climate change bangladesh and proposes ideas to help the most vulnerable,institutional

on climate and health 1,institutional
climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity,institutional
the impacts are already harming health through air pollution disease extreme weather events forced displacement food insecurity and pressures on mental health,institutional
every year environmental factors take the lives of around 13 million people,institutional
meeting the goals of the paris agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone,institutional
avoiding the worst climate impacts could help prevent 250 000 additional climate related deaths per year from 2030 to 2050 mainly from malnutrition malaria diarrhoea and heat stress,institutional
the value of health gains from reducing carbon emissions would be approximately double the global cost of implementing carbon mitigation measures,institutional
over 90 per cent of people breathe unhealthy levels of air pollution largely resulting from burning fossil fuels driving climate change,institutional
in 2018 air pollution from fossil fuels caused 2,institutional
9 trillion in health and economic costs about 8 billion a day,institutional
transportation produces around 20 per cent of global carbon emissions,institutional
alternatives like walking and cycling are not only green but also offer major health benefits such as reducing the risk of many chronic health conditions and improving mental health,institutional
systems to produce package and distribute food generate a third of greenhouse gas emissions,institutional
more sustainable production would mitigate climate impacts and support more nutritious diets that could prevent close to 11 million premature deaths a year,institutional
health systems are the main line of defence for populations faced with emerging health threats including from climate change,institutional
to protect health and avoid widening health inequities countries must build climate resilient health systems,institutional
the majority of countries identify health as a priority sector vulnerable to climate change,institutional
but a huge finance gap remains,institutional
less than 2 per cent of multilateral climate finance goes to health projects,institutional
healthy societies rely on well functioning ecosystems to provide clean air fresh water medicines and food security,institutional
these help to limit disease and stabilize the climate,institutional
but biodiversity loss is happening at an unprecedented rate impacting human health worldwide and increasing the risk of emerging infectious diseases,institutional
climate change refers to any change in climate over time whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity,institutional
margaret chan stated that for public health climate change is the defining issue for the 21st century,institutional
climate and weather variables affect the air people breathe the food they eat the water they drink and the chances that they will get infected with a life threatening infectious disease,institutional
climate change has made a significant impact to health,institutional
it is estimated that between 2030 to 2050 climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths annually,institutional
high temperatures raise the levels of ozone and other pollutants leading to 1,institutional
2 million deaths due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease annually,institutional
extreme weather is the most apparent effect of climate change as extreme heat waves and heavy rain storms are occurring with increase worldwide,institutional
rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patterns are expected to reduce crop yields compromising food security and worsening undernutrition which accounts for 3 million deaths each year,institutional
heat stress hyperthermia and extreme cold hypothermia caused by intense short term temperature fluctuations significantly affect health leading to increased death rates from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,institutional
climate sensitive diseases such as diarrhea malaria and malnutrition caused a significant number of deaths globally,institutional
climate change has become the new driver of malnutrition increasing mortality rates by 5 to 20 times,institutional
human activities in relation to climate change such as increased urbanization storage of water for household use and use of cooling systems lead to an increased risk for vectorborne diseases,institutional
the united nations framework convention on climate change unfcc defines climate change as a change which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and an addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods,institutional
the cause of climate change is the increased emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which trap the energy in our atmosphere causing a greenhouse effect,institutional
this greenhouse effect warms the earth causing extreme weather patterns compromised food security and increased vector related and climate related diseases and deaths,institutional
evidences suggests that various activities directly or indirectly caused by humans have resulted in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which causes climate change and global warming,institutional
majority of these gases come from burning fossil fuels for the production of energy with deforestation industrial processes and agricultural processes as significant contributors,institutional
effects of climate change have made a significant impact to health,institutional
it is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 250 000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050 38 000 are due to heat exposure in the elderly 48 000 due to diarrhea 60 000 due to malaria 95 000 due to childhood malnutrition,institutional
9 000 due to others influence on natural disasters current research findings suggest that climate change is causing a dramatic increase of occurrence and severity of extreme weather conditions worldwide causing destruction and massive disasters,institutional
10 out of the 20 countries with the highest risk of disasters belong to the western pacific region,institutional
the number of reported weather related natural disasters has tripled globally,institutional
these lead to over 60 000 deaths every year mainly in developing countries,institutional
the continued increase in sea levels and occurrence of extreme weather events are expected to damage homes and business establishments as well as medical facilities,institutional
the unavailability of fresh water supply due to increasingly variable rainfall patterns can compromise hygiene thereby increasing the risk of diarrheal disease which kills 2,institutional
2 million people every year,institutional
with the increasing frequency and intensity of floods it is expected that it will increase the risk of water borne diseases due to the contamination of food supplies by flood water,institutional
this could also create breeding grounds for disease carrying insects such as mosquitoes,institutional
effects on food security climate change is expected to affect all dimensions of food security availability accessibility utilization and food systems stability,institutional
rising sea levels will cause floods damage crop and affect food production and food security,institutional
variable rainfall and increasing temperatures are expected to reduce crop yields due to increased crop failure and new patterns of pests in many developing countries where food security is already a problem,institutional
the changing sea and inland temperature rising sea level and changing precipitation and water availability affect the abundance productivity and distribution of freshwater aquatic species,institutional
the prevalence of malnutrition which currently causes 3,institutional
5 million deaths annually is expected to rise due to the decrease in the production of staple foods in many of the poorest regions as facilitated by the rising temperatures and variable precipitation,institutional
there is a need to modify consumption patterns adopt sustainable agricultural practices and engage in new livelihood strategies in order to keep up with the rapidly changing environment,institutional
increased risk of disease climate change affects the transmission frequency and severity of communicable diseases through different mechanisms depending on the nature of the disease,institutional
changes in temperature increases the risk of acquiring food borne diseases since food is stored transported handled and prepared under warm ambient conditions,institutional
ambient temperature humidity and availability of water for breeding determine the distribution reproduction rate biting behaviour and survival of vectors,institutional
the amount and temperature of rainfall influences the transport and transmission of infectious agents as well as their growth and survival,institutional
frequent flooding may increase the risk of pathogen transmission from rodents causing diseases such as leptospirosis and tularemia,institutional
climate change directly affects the transmission of mosquitoborne diseases including malaria dengue and viral encephalitis by shifting the vectors geographic range and increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the pathogen incubation period,institutional
increases in sea surface temperatures and sea level can lead to increased incidence of water borne infectious and toxinrelated illnesses such as cholera and shellfish poisoning,institutional
who actions health must be seen as a main and essential concern in the climate debate who recommendations in 2014 the world health assembly ratified a who work plan to mitigate the effects of climate change on health,institutional
the objectives are strengthening partnerships to support health and climate within and outside the united nations system and providing leadership on health throughout the system wide response of the united nations to climate change,institutional
raising awareness of the links between health and climate and the potential for enhancing health through mitigation of the extent of climate change through the development of tools guidance information and training packages as well as the networks for information dissemination,institutional
promoting and guiding the generation of scientific evidence,institutional
providing policy and technical support to the implementation of the public health response to climate change,institutional
the regional committee for the western pacific endorsed the regional framework for action to protect human health from the effects of climate change in the asia pacific region,institutional
6 it encourages member states to develop national strategies and plans to include current and predicted climate change risks to control climate sensitive health risks and outcomes strengthen existing health infrastructure and human resources surveillance early warning and communication and response systems for climate sensitive risks and outcomes establish programmes to reduce the climate footprint of the health sector assess the health impacts of the decisions made on climate change by other sectors facilitate the health sector to actively participate in the preparation of national programmes of action actively participate in the development of a work plan to increase who s technical support to member states for addressing the effects of climate change on health,institutional
to estimate the range timing and magnitude of future health impacts induced by climate change disease incidence data are needed to serve as baseline epidemiologic data,institutional
adoption of best practices such as enhancing the sustainability of livelihood systems and engaging in sustainable agricultural practices must be employed,institutional
there is a need for an interdisciplinary and holistic approach among governments societies and individuals coupled with changes in behavior and practices in order to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure sustainability,institutional
efficient implementation of adaptation strategies and its integration into the national health systems are essential to mitigate the health effects of the current climate variability,institutional
surveillance systems for climate sensitive infectious diseases should be strengthened,institutional
these include better use of early warning information to anticipate onset duration and intensity of epidemics,institutional
health systems must be able to withstand climate change especially in developing countries the co benefits of climate change reduction and improved health should be maximized,institutional
the health sector should reduce its own climate footprint,institutional
health sector leaders must work with climate negotiators to confront climate change,institutional
taking into account health to enhance mitigation ambition who inputs to the co chairs of the ad hoc working group on the durban platform for enhanced action adp the following submission has been prepared by the who department of public health and environment,institutional
the summary of evidence and proposals for consideration draw heavily on the report our planet our health our future human health and the rio conventions jointly produced by who and the secretariats of the unfccc cbd and unccd1,institutional
framing health and climate change the health impacts of climate change act as a tangible indicator of global progress on climate change efforts,institutional
in this regard health is a more readily accessible concept than for example either carbon dioxide emissions or sustainable development,institutional
health provides a strong link between climate change and sustainable development,institutional
together with the health co benefits of climate change mitigation this forms a positive message around climate change mitigation and adaptation,institutional
it can serve as an important reminder to governments and civil society alike that there are significant health care savings to be had from mitigation efforts and that the ultimate objective of the unfccc is not only to avoid the worst impacts of climate change but also to create a healthier sustainable future,institutional
within the unfccc negotiations themselves this aim could be promoted by recalling the original article 1 definition of adverse effects and adopting health indicators as an additional marker of global progress to enhance public understanding and political accountability,institutional
this contribution outlines the position of health as a central justification for international action on climate change,institutional
it summarizes the continually strengthening evidence for the links between human health and climate change,institutional
it further considers opportunities to improve policy linkages within the implementation of the unfccc and related mechanisms in order to promote both climate and health goals,institutional
mitigation of climate change and its co benefits for health if designed wisely policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to improve public health substantially reducing the global burden of a number of diseases including heart disease cancer obesity diabetes osteoporosis mental illness lung disease and road deaths and injuries,institutional
these ancillary benefits co benefits of mitigation highlight that what is good for the environment is often also good for health,institutional
however it is possible for this pattern to be reversed and some mitigation policies have the potential to harm human health,institutional
there are significant cost savings to be made as a result of improved public health which has important implications for the cost and viability of mitigation policies,institutional
additionally a health perspective provides a number of practical applications in its ability to identify the potential negative health impacts of well meaning response measures and assist in the prioritization of climate change mitigation programmes,institutional
1 potential health gains through mitigation in key sectors the co benefits of mitigation to health are often looked at from a sectoral approach and provide a catalytic argument for the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions,institutional
the potential for health cobenefits has been described in recent years in a series of papers examining health implications of case 1 for more information please refer to the chapter 2 of the who report human health and the rio conventions http www,institutional
html studies of mitigation policies in major sectors and a who series health in the green economy which reviews the health impacts and benefits of the mitigation policies assessed in the fourth assessment report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change,institutional
key sectors where such policies are of particular importance include household energy transport food and agriculture and electricity generation,institutional
2 economic gains from health co benefits early evidence on economic valuation of the health co benefits of climate change policy suggests the potential for very large gains for national economies,institutional
valuation studies to date have mainly considered benefits through air pollution and conclude that even considering only this mechanism improvements in health could largely cover the economic costs of the mitigation measures,institutional
for example a recent study in the european union estimated the health benefits of reaching defined emission reductions targets through potential reductions in chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disease and resultant loss of productivity and improvements in life expectancy,institutional
it was estimated that reaching the 20 emission reduction target by 2020 would save almost 52 billion in reduced medical bills and avoided ill health,institutional
it was further expected that a shift in european union emission reduction targets from 20 to 30 by 2020 would result in 140 000 additional life years and 13 million fewer non productive days due to chronic illness,institutional
this would add up to an additional 30,institutional
5 billion almost two thirds of the cost of the additional mitigation efforts 46 billion,institutional
additional savings may be found in increased productivity resulting from healthier environments and a healthier workforce,institutional
including health and economic co benefits gives a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of the implications of mitigation policies and generally presents a stronger case for more sustainable choices,institutional
consideration of the health co benefits of climate change mitigation brings together the social economic and environmental dimensions of climate policy and provides an opportunity for parties under the unfccc to promote a more integrated vision of sustainable development,institutional
3 opportunities for better linkage of climate and health goals the health co benefits of climate change mitigation provide one of the strongest overlaps and catalysts between mitigation and adaptation negotiations,institutional
the unfccc provides a number of important opportunities for the public health community to engage with climate change at local national and international levels,institutional
however since the 1992 rio earth summit the representation of health within the unfccc has been relatively weak,institutional
progress towards the unfccc goals and overall sustainable development could be enhanced by better utilizing the capacities of the health community,institutional
1 linking health to mitigation and adaptation efforts the project based flexibility mechanisms under the kyoto protocol such as the cdm and ji provide an excellent opportunity for accelerating investment in climate change mitigation and assisting developing countries in sustainable development co benefits in particular health,institutional
the design and regulations of these mechanisms for sectors that offer significant health and economic co benefits such as the transport housing health infrastructure and mining sectors could better promote health focussed sustainable development,institutional
in doing so it is essential that regulations governing these projects facilitate the declaration assessment monitoring and verification of all co benefits in particular those related to health and safety,institutional
combined with a strong demand for offsets from an international carbon market the continued use of flexible mechanisms like the cdm can facilitate co benefits such as energy security which is essential for robust and autonomous health care facilities in rural and low income areas benefiting both the environment and the economy of the host country,institutional
ensuring that the adverse effects of climate change on public health and social systems are considered within the naps is also a critical step to enable ldcs to adequately plan and prepare for the destabilizing effects of climate change on health and health systems,institutional
a number of appropriate responses will help to remedy these imbalances,institutional
in particular the integration of adaptation measures with efforts to strengthen health systems and stronger engagement with the health sector at all levels in strategic planning and implementation would prove beneficial,institutional
technical and policy support could be provided to the least developed countries through health agencies to help strengthen response measures,institutional
the conference of the parties to the unfccc has agreed that adaptation policies should be in part assessed and prioritized such that potential negative impacts on human health are minimized,institutional
2 health impact assessments article 4,institutional
1 f of the convention affirms a commitment from parties to the convention to ensuring that climate change policies are designed in a way that minimizes their adverse effects on public health,institutional
while there is the potential for major co benefits between environmental and social development they will not be unlocked without the design of integrated policies that promote health gains and manage health risks alongside the drive to reduce environmental impact,institutional
mandated by resolution wha61,institutional
19 of the world health assembly and an action plan endorsed by its executive board who has developed a number of relevant tools ranging from disaster preparedness and risk reduction to climate change specific health impact assessment guides,institutional
within the unfccc these can be used for assessment of global progress on tackling the issue of climate change determining whether or not implementation strategies are appropriate prioritization and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation programmes,institutional
use of these tools can help ensure that unfccc policies designed to benefit the environment and stabilize global emissions are not simultaneously detrimental to health,institutional

the estimations indicate that the 1c cooling experienced in the already cold highlands over the past five decades likely has reduced consumption possibilities by about 2 3 percent in these areas,institutional
since the much richer population in the lowlands have benefitted slightly from recent climate change the simulations suggest that recent climate change has contributed to an increase in inequality and poverty in bolivia,institutional
poor and indigenous peoples in the highlands are among the most severely affected populations,institutional
no statistically significant effect on life expectancy was found,institutional

introduction although bolivia is located entirely within the tropics the large altitude variations within the country imply that it has almost every conceivable type of climate ranging from andean glaciers via salt deserts to steaming rainforest,institutional
this variation makes bolivia ideally suited for an empirical analysis of the social impacts of climate change because the limited variation in the time dimension can be complemented by ample variation in the spatial dimension,institutional
a simple way to gauge how climate affects human development is to compare human development across regions with different climates,institutional
this has for example been done by horowitz 2006 which uses a cross section of 156 countries to estimate the relationship between temperature and income level,institutional
the overall relationship found is very strongly negative with a 2f increase in global temperatures implying a 13 percent drop in income,institutional
this is very dramatic but the relationship is thought to be mostly historical and thus not very relevant for the prediction of the contemporary effects of climate change in the recent past or near future,institutional
in order to control for historical factors the paper includes colonial mortality rates as an explanatory variable and finds a much more limited but still highly significant contemporaneous effect of temperature on incomes,institutional
the contemporaneous relationship estimated implies that a 2f increase in global temperatures would cause approximately a 3,institutional
5 percent drop in world gdp,institutional
in order to further control for historical differences horowitz 2006 uses more homogeneous sub samples such as one with only oecd countries or only countries from the former soviet union and the negative relationship still holds,institutional
however as directions for further research he recommends empirical studies of income and temperature variations within large heterogeneous countries which would provide much more thorough control for historical differences,institutional
this is exactly what we do in this paper,institutional
using data from the 311 municipalities in bolivia we estimate contemporary relationships between temperature and consumption levels a proxy for income as well as between temperature and life expectancy,institutional
these relationships are then used to gauge the likely direction and magnitude of effects of climate change in bolivia,institutional
the rest of the paper is organized as follows,institutional
section 2 describes the data and the sources,institutional
section 3 estimates municipal level econometric models of the relationships between climate variables life expectancy and consumption levels,institutional
section 4 analyzes climate change in bolivia from 1948 to 2008,institutional
section 5 uses the estimated models from section 3 to simulate the effect of recent climate change from section 4 on consumption levels poverty and inequality,institutional
finally section 6 concludes,institutional
the data the data used for this paper consist of both cross section and time series data,institutional
the municipal level cross section data base used to estimate the relationships between climate 2 development and migration in bolivia is constructed using data from several different sources,institutional

in order to assess the climate change trends in the different parts of bolivia we obtained monthly temperature and precipitation data from 1948 to 2008 from the monthly climatic data for the world mcdw publication of the us national climatic data center,institutional
1 the original data are organized in 61 printed volumes with 12 issues in each one for each month of the year totaling 721 months,institutional
all data have been quality checked and were published by the ncdc about 3 months after the raw data were collected,institutional
from each of these monthly issues we extracted average monthly temperature and total monthly for each of 31 bolivian stations in order to create time series for each station,institutional
the normal temperature for each station month is calculated as the average temperature observed for the reference period 1960 90,institutional
some stations have so few and scattered 1 this data is available for free at http www7,institutional
3 observations that it is not feasible to calculate reliable normal temperatures and these stations have therefore been discarded,institutional
only the stations that have at least eight observations for each calendar month during the reference period were included in the analysis in this paper,institutional
an additional requirement for inclusion of a data station in the present analysis is that it has at least 300 out of the 721 possible monthly observations,institutional
the 18 stations that satisfy both of these requirements are listed in table 2,institutional
table 2 meteorological stations in bolivia with adequate monthly data from 1948 to 2008 elevation station latitude longitude m camiri 20 00 s 63 32 w 798 chara a 17 35 s 69 36 w 4054 cobija 11 02 s 68 47 w 235 cochabamba 17 25 s 66 11 w 2548 concepci n 16 09 s 62 01 w 497 la paz el alto 16 31 s 68 11 w 4058 oruro 17 58 s 67 04 w 3707 puerto suarez 18 59 s 57 49 w 134 riberalta 11 00 s 66 07 w 141 robor 18 19 s 59 46 w 276 rurrenabaque 14 28 s 67 34 w 204 san ignacio de velasco 16 23 s 60 58 w 413 san joaqu n 13 04 s 64 49 w 140 santa cruz trompillo 17 48 s 63 11 w 418 sucre 19 01 s 65 18 w 2904 tarija 21 33 s 64 42 w 1854 trinidad 14 49 s 64 55 w 155 yacuiba 21 57 s 63 39 w 645 source ncdc s monthly climatic data for the world,institutional
table 3 shows the average normal temperatures for each month for each of these stations,institutional
it is seen that the climate differs dramatically from region to region with chara a in the far west being cold throughout the year due to the high elevation while most low land regions are hot throughout the year due to the location close to the equator,institutional
the difference in temperature between the warmest and the coldest month also varies,institutional
in cobija and riberalta for example the difference between the warmest and the coldest month is less than 3 c,institutional
yacuiba is the southernmost station in bolivia and therefore the station that shows the most marked temperature variations over the year but the difference between the warmest and the coldest month is still only 11 c,institutional
4 using the normal values for each station and each month we calculate monthly anomalies for each station for the whole period actual temperature minus normal temperature for that month,institutional
anomalies are easier to analyze than the raw temperature and precipitation data since the seasonal variation is eliminated through the subtraction of normal monthly temperatures,institutional
figure a1 in the appendix plots the temperature anomalies for each station,institutional
the precipitation data applied in the analyses have been subjected to the same procedure and all precipitation anomalies are plotted in figure a2 of the appendix,institutional
modeling climate and human development bolivia is a very heterogeneous country both with respect to climate and with respect to development,institutional
some regions have extremely harsh climates with sub zero temperatures most of the year and very little rain,institutional
other regions are hot and constantly humid,institutional
some people live in remote areas without road access in simple one room dwellings without electricity piped water bathroom or any other basic conveniences,institutional
other people live in mansions with home cinema swimming pool fitness room and servants,institutional
5 this variation makes bolivia ideally suited for estimating the impact of climate on development as the limited variation in time can be complemented by ample variation in space while still holding the most important confounding variables constant,institutional
as proxies for human development we will use the following two variables i life expectancy at birth and ii consumption per capita,institutional
across the 311 municipalities in bolivia life expectancy at birth varies between 40 and 70 years while annual consumption per capita varies between 245 and 2 565 purchasing power adjusted international dollars of the year 2001,institutional
the variables of principal interest are the climate variables average temperature and average precipitation,institutional
simple correlations between these and the two human development variables are presented in table 4,institutional
according to these simple correlations warm and wet is good while cold and dry is bad for human development,institutional
table 4 correlations between climate variables and hdi at the municipal level variable correlation with correlation with life expectancy consumption average annual temperature 0,institutional
34 average annual precipitation 0,institutional
26 in order to control for other differences between municipalities we include the climate variables in a regression framework together with two important control variables education levels and urbanization rates which are both unlikely to be affected by climate changes in the short run but are clearly related to life expectancy and consumption levels,institutional
it is also important to allow for non linear effects as both too high and too low temperatures may be unfavorable for human development just as both too much and too little rain may cause problems e,institutional

the life expectancy regression will take the same form as the consumption regression except that we will not apply the natural logarithm to the dependent variable,institutional
both regressions are weighted ols regressions where the weights consist of the population size 6 in each municipality,institutional

note numbers in parenthesis are t values,institutional
when t values are numerically larger than 2 we will consider the coefficient to be statistically significant corresponding to a confidence level of 95,institutional
the results at the bottom of the table show that just these four explanatory variables temperature precipitation education and urbanization rates explain 92 percent of the variation in consumption levels between the municipalities in bolivia,institutional
this is an extremely good fit which suggests that we have included the most important explanatory variables and that including additional variables would make little difference,institutional
the same four variables only explain about 74 percent of the variation in life expectancy which is less impressive but still very good for a cross section model,institutional
education is by far the most important variable explaining about 88 percent of the variation in consumption levels and about 54 percent of the variation in life expectancy,institutional
urbanization rates are also significant in both regressions in a non linear manner that suggests that the optimal urbanization rate is around 70 percent for consumption and about 50 percent for life expectancy,institutional
the temperature variables are highly significant in explaining consumption but not life expectancy,institutional
precipitation is not significant in any of the regressions,institutional
as it is difficult to assess the non linear effects of temperature directly by looking at the estimated coefficients we have plotted the estimated relationship in figure 1,institutional
the axes are scaled to 7 represent the actual range of temperatures and consumption levels in different bolivian municipalities so that the magnitude of climate impacts can be seen in the appropriate perspective,institutional
a 95 confidence interval on the temperature consumption relationship is also indicated in the graph,institutional
figure 1 estimated short term relationship between temperature and consumption levels in bolivia consumption per capita ppa year 2245 1745 1245 745 245 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 average annual temperature c the estimated relationship indicates that bolivians do considerably better in hot areas than in cold areas even when controlling for other factors such as education attainment and urbanization levels,institutional
inhabitants in the hottest regions are able to consume almost twice as much as inhabitants in the coldest regions,institutional
the slope is decreasing with temperature suggesting that already hot areas would benefit only little in terms of consumption from additional increases in temperature whereas presently cold areas would benefit more,institutional
having established that temperature has an important effect on consumption possibilities in bolivia we will now proceed to test whether there have been any significant changes in temperatures in bolivia during the last 6 decades,institutional
recent climate change in bolivia in this section we will analyze climate data from the 18 meteorological stations of highest quality in bolivia from may 1948 to may 2008 to test whether there are any significant trends and whether these trends differ between regions,institutional
8 the actual measured temperatures are first converted into temperature anomalies by subtracting the average normal temperature for each station month as calculated for the reference period 1960 90,institutional
all the temperature anomaly series are plotted in figure a1 in the appendix,institutional
once we have the series of temperature anomalies it is straightforward to test whether there is a significant trend,institutional
this is done by regressing the anomaly on a trend variable which has been scaled so that the coefficient can be directly interpreted as temperature change per decade in degrees celsius,institutional
we use a confidence level of 95 percent to decide whether the trend is statistically significant which means that the p value of the trend coefficient should be less than 0,institutional
05 for the trend to be significant,institutional
table 6 shows the estimated trends in temperatures for each of the 18 stations in bolivia,institutional
of these four stations show significant warming since the middle of the previous century and nine show no significant change and 5 show significant cooling,institutional
none of the stations in bolivia get even close to having observations for all the 721 months in the 1948 2008 period but some stations have reported more consistently than others,institutional
if we limit ourselves to the 15 stations that have at least 400 observations we find that three show significant warming four show significant cooling and eight show no significant trend,institutional
a similar distribution is found if we limit ourselves to the 11 stations that have at least 500 observations,institutional
9 the patterns of warming cooling show a distinct geographical distribution with the highland stations in the southwestern part of bolivia showing consistent cooling and the lowland areas to the north and east showing slight warming see map 1,institutional
this is consistent with ncdc data from neighboring countries which show cooling in many parts of peru and chile but warming in brazil see andersen suxo verner 2009 andersen verner 2009 and andersen rom n verner 2009,institutional
since the data from any single station is subject to idiosyncratic influences it is necessary to average over several stations in order to get reliable results,institutional
in the case of bolivia the data suggests that highland areas in general have experienced cooling over the last 60 years with an average trend around 0,institutional
for the purposes of the simulations in the next section we will therefore assume a uniform cooling trend of 0,institutional
2 c decade for all municipalities located in the departments of tarija chuquisaca potos oruro and the highland areas of la paz above 2000 meters above sea level,institutional
10 for the lowland areas the evidence shows mostly no significant trends but interspersed with a few positive trends,institutional
for the purposes of the simulations in the next section we will assume a slight warming trend of 0,institutional
05 c decade in all lowland areas,institutional
the general cooling of the highlands appears to be inconsistent with the rapid melting of several bolivian glaciers especially the chacaltaya and the zongo glaciers close to el alto see francou et al 2000 and ramirez et al 2001 but it is not,institutional
first of all the glaciers have been melting continuously since the little ice age about 1550 to 1850 with only a brief slowdown during the relatively cool period of 1950 1980 and it is normal for melting to accelerate towards the end just like a small ice cube melts faster than a big ice cube,institutional
in addition glaciers depend on other factors than temperature notably precipitation but also cloud cover relative humidity and the intensity of solar irradiation ramirez 2008,institutional
a study of oxygen isotope series generated from ice cores from two bolivian glaciers suggests that precipitation has decreased steadily since about 1974 hoffman et al 2003 2,institutional
the reduction in precipitation is likely associated with the general reduction in cloud cover over the tropics since measurements began in the early 1980s3 and less clouds means more intense solar irradiation which accelerates glacial melt,institutional
decreased cloud cover at this altitude also works to amplify the diurnal temperature range increasing daytime temperatures which would cause increased melting but reducing night time temperatures even more because of the missing cloud blanket which explains the reduction in average temperatures,institutional
moreover upon closer inspection of the temperature data it becomes clear that temperatures have not fallen equally throughout the year,institutional
at the el alto station for example summer temperatures have been increasing and winter temperatures decreasing see figure 2,institutional
since winter is the dry season in el alto the lower winter temperatures will provide little benefit for the glaciers which cannot accumulate mass without snowfall,institutional
instead these glaciers are much more sensitive to changes in summer temperatures and precipitation,institutional
this explains why the enso el ni o southern oscillation has such a strong effect on bolivian glaciers,institutional
during enso s warm and dry phase el ni o the mass balances are always negative implying shrinking glaciers,institutional
in the cooler and more humid la ni a phase the glaciers return to equilibrium and sometimes show a small increase,institutional
the increase in the glacier regression rate since the end of the 1970s appears to coincide with the pacific shift of 1976 the date after which the el ni o event became more frequent and more intense ramirez et al 2001,institutional
it was the unusually strong el ni o event of 1997 98 which caused the permanent closing of the world s highest ski resort on the chacaltaya glacier,institutional
2 however this decrease is not considered unusual in a historical context and over the whole 20th century the isotope index is stable 3 according to nasa s international satellite cloud climatology project isccp http isccp,institutional
html average tropical cloud cover has decreased from about 66 in the 19080s to about 61 in the first 8 years of this century,institutional
the solid black line is a 30 day moving average of daily temperature anomalies,institutional
the colder winters in the already cold highlands could potentially have an adverse effect on the predominantly poor and indigenous population who inhabit the bolivian highlands since one of their main worries and limitations on agricultural productivity is frost gonzales iwanciw cusicanqui giles aparicio effen n,institutional
this is the hypothesis that we will formally test and quantify in the following section,institutional
we have adequate precipitation data for 19 meteorological stations in bolivia,institutional
the precipitation anomalies for each station have been plotted in figure a2 in the appendix,institutional
table 7 below shows the results of a simple trend regression for each station,institutional
using a confidence level of 95 percent we find that only five out of the 19 stations have experienced a significant trend in precipitation over the last six decades and all of them experienced increases,institutional
oruro in the highlands saw a slight increase of about 1,institutional
6 mm decade whereas rurrenabaque santa cruz el trompillo tarija and trinidad saw somewhat larger increases,institutional
since precipitation was not significant in the models of human development estimated in the previous section it is not very important what we assume about precipitation trends in the simulation exercises in the next section,institutional
only one station in the highlands showed a significant trend and it was only a very small increase so it is reasonably to assume that in general there have been no systematic changes in precipitation in the highlands,institutional
trinidad in the lowlands showed a substantial increasing trend of about 15 mm decade,institutional
but upon closer inspection of the anomalies see figure 3 below it becomes clear that all of this increase took place before 1978 after which the trend has been negative,institutional
thus what sometimes appears as a statistically significant trend is really more of a natural cycle,institutional
we will therefore assume no systematic trends in precipitation in the lowlands either,institutional

simulating the impacts of recent climate change in this section we will use the consumption model estimated in section 2 to simulate the impact of the climate change experienced during the last 50 years as indicated by the analysis in section 3,institutional
we will compare two scenarios one with climate change which is the factual scenario and one with no climate change which is the counterfactual scenario,institutional
the temperatures in the climate change scenario ti cc are the actual temperatures whereas the temperatures in the counterfactual scenario ti ncc are the temperatures that would have been if temperatures had not changed during the last 50 years,institutional
that is for all highland municipalities temperatures are 1 c higher in the no climate change scenario compared to the climate change scenario whereas for all lowland municipalities temperatures are 0,institutional
25 c lower in the no climate change scenario,institutional
as there has been no systematic change in precipitation the precipitation terms cancel out and the other factors education and urbanization rates we will maintain constant so as to isolate the climate change effect,institutional
after estimating this ratio for each municipality it is straightforward to calculate the percentage change in consumption levels that can be attributed to climate change,institutional
at the national level the model estimates that climate change during the last 50 years has caused a reduction in consumption of about 1,institutional
table 8 shows the results disaggregated at the state level,institutional
the most disadvantaged states are the highland states oruro potos and la paz which are estimated to have lost almost 3 percent of their consumption capacity due to the already cold climates becoming colder,institutional
chuquisaca and tarija have also lost out according to this simulation but a bit less as they were initially warmer and the slope of the temperature consumption relationship was thus less steep,institutional
all lowland states have gained slightly,institutional

introduction climate change represents a major threat to human beings and other forms of life on our planet,institutional
the potential impact of climate change on the social and environmental determinants of health outcomes is at the heart of both scientific and policy making efforts,institutional

understanding the effects that extreme temperatures could have on human health is key to promote both effective adaptation policies to rising temperatures from climatic change and mitigation policies around the planet,institutional
the potential impacts of weather changes on mortality are usually divided in two categories direct effects i,institutional
those produced by temperature increases and indirect effects arising mainly from changes in vector borne diseases and food security or increases in weather related natural disasters,institutional
there are in fact other indirect impacts it is known that weather tends to affect economic growth energy consumption agricultural production labor productivity and pollution levels and all those impacts would likely produce a feedback effect towards worse health deschnes greenstone 2011,institutional
across the literature some articles limit themselves to study the present sensitivity of mortality at different temperature levels e,institutional
otrachshenko et al,institutional
2017 for russia and others study also temperature mortality aspects due to climate change e,institutional
deschnes greenstone 2011 or a,institutional
barreca 2012for the us burgess et al,institutional
2017 for india or yu et al,institutional
2019 for china,institutional
the few articles that study climate change impacts on mortality use some of ipcc greenhouse gases emissions scenarios projections representative concentration pathways rcp2,institutional
0 or rcp8,institutional
51 o alternative scenarios,institutional
for example yu et al,institutional
2019 consider two extreme pathways rcp2,institutional
6 and rcp8,institutional
5 whereas burgess et al,institutional
2017 take the hadley cm3 a1f1 scenario that authors affirm corresponds to a business as usual trajectory and deschenes 2018 follow the ccsme3 a2 scenario,institutional
a u relationship between thermal ambient levels and mortality has been extensively documented in the literature,institutional
the causal effect of temperature on mortality rates is usually non linear,institutional
that is the reason why nonparametric models estimated by ordinary least squares have been widely applied basu 2009,institutional
there are several alternatives to account for nonlinearity log linear functions e,institutional
curriero et al,institutional
2002 polynomial functions basu samet 2002 splines which are piecewise polynomial functions e,institutional

barreca 2012 a,institutional
barreca shimshack 2012 or bins deschnes greenstone 2011 otrachshenko et al,institutional
2017 deschenes 2018 yu et al,institutional
2019 among others,institutional
bins are among the alternatives more widely used in the literature to capture the non linear relationship between temperature and mortality rates,institutional
they arise from discretizing the temperature in parts,institutional
the binned result is in terms of the time unit selected,institutional
for example if daily temperatures in a month within a year are used then the marginal effect for a given bin is the additional effect of one more day for which the temperature falls into that bin,institutional
the main advantage of bins over the other ways of capturing non linearity is that they offer a very flexible functional form that allow each temperature bin to have a different impact on mortality,institutional
in addition since most of the recent papers in economics use bins we follow that same approach to ease the comparison,institutional
2 as highlighted by several authors as deschenes 2014 or son et al,institutional
2019 even when we restrict our review to those articles that use bins it is not easy to compare the results because of several reasons,institutional
there are many differences among studies related to the units of measurement of mortality rates and weather conditions as well as on valuation methodologies,institutional
first in general with respect to deaths since heat or cold related illnesses are not coded separately under the international classification of diseases studies typically relate all causes mortality to ambient measures of weather,institutional
in addition some articles use monthly mortality a,institutional
barreca 2012 for example while others use yearly mortality rates deschnes greenstone 2011 otrachshenko et al,institutional
2017 yu et al,institutional
2019 among others and only a few use daily mortality cohen dechezleprtre 2019,institutional
second in what concerns meteorological conditions temperature and precipitations are the most usual control variables included in the empirical studies,institutional
for temperatures there is no homogeneous definition of what cold day or hot day is and so each of the studies divides temperature bins differently,institutional
3 since the mortality risk is expected to change with the level of temperature comparisons loose precision,institutional
another aspect is that most articles use mean temperature e,institutional
barreca 2012 deschnes greenstone 2011 among others and only in few cases minimum or maximum temperatures are also considered for the regressions e,institutional
yu et al,institutional
2019 or cohen dechezleprtre 2019,institutional
another variable that is something included in mortality weather regressions is humidity a,institutional
other authors combine temperature and humidity in a heat index to capture apparent temperature yu et al,institutional
2019 and the results only change slightly,institutional
according to the review performed by deschenes 2014 p,institutional
609 adding precipitation or humidity do not lead to meaningful changes in model estimates compared to models that only control for temperatures,institutional
yu et al,institutional
2019 also find that the change in mortality estimates after including humidity in the model are almost negligible,institutional
third once mortality impacts are calculated a few articles estimate the annual total of years of life lost deschenes moretti 2009 burgess et al,institutional
2017 cohen dechezleprtre 2019,institutional
to do that implies leaving aside monetary valuation 4 and differentiate life years lost depending on each age group life expectancy,institutional
to avoid valuation is not free of problems,institutional
as deschnes greenstone 2011 p,institutional
183 explicitly state people dying from extreme weather may not be the median citizen and so his her life expectancy will like likely be lower than that of the average citizen,institutional
another thing that may happen is that life expectancies may vary along time and that shift is not considered in this type of calculation,institutional
moving beyond life years impacts requires an economic assessment,institutional
there are articles that use the present value of foregone earnings of a death among working population which requires to know deaths by age group income by age as well as labour force participation otrachshenko et al,institutional
this perspective is what is known as the human capital approach and as such constitutes a lower bound since productivity lost is only a component of the value of a statistical life there are also utility losses when a life ends,institutional
hence present value of lost income neglects the value of leisure time and important subjective aspects and focuses only on pecuniary impacts of death,institutional
the full willingness derives from what is known as the value of a statistical life vsl estimates,institutional
5 6 in this case an option could be to assign the same value of a statistical life vsl for all age groups another would be to calculate the value of a statistical life per year vsly which allow a differentiation of the value of life for people in different age groups since expected remaining years up to life expectancy varies by age group,institutional
deschnes greenstone 2011 lead these types of estimations since it uses two alternatives one is to assign a fixed value of a statistical life year of 100 000 for the different years lost due to deaths in each age group and the other allows for the value of statistical life year to be adjusted over time by a real per capita income growth of 2 per year and an elasticity of the value of the statistical life year to income of 1,institutional
in any of those cases as we will show in the next section the value can come from local data or from a transfer valuation adjusted by relative income and by the elasticity of vsl to income or both,institutional
although the existing studies use a variety of periods models mortality indicators meteorological variables the number and size of the weather bins the reference bins and ways to value the great majority of publications find that temperature extremes lead to significant reductions in mortality,institutional
this assessment can be made more precise if we illustrate that with a few of those articles that use temperature bins with panel data and so are clearly related to our work,institutional
deschnes greenstone 2011 is representative of numerous studies for the us on mortalitytemperature links,institutional
the authors find for the 1968 to 2002 period that an additional day with a mean temperature exceeding 90 f leads to an increase in annual age adjusted mortality rate of 0,institutional
11 per cent with respect to the one within the 50 60 f interval,institutional
similarly a day with temperatures below 20 f is associated with an increase in annual mortality between 0,institutional
07 and 0,institutional
08 per cent,institutional
when they take account for climate change they estimate that mortality will increase 3 per cent by the end of the century,institutional
otrachshenko et al,institutional
2017 analyze the case of russia in the 1989 2014 period and find that one extra day with temperatures above 25 c with respect to the 20 25 c range increase yearly mortality by 0,institutional
06 whereas an additional day with low temperature below 30 c only decreases annual mortality by 0,institutional
01 and is not significant,institutional
7 using the present value of foregone income of working population the authors estimate that an extra day of heat cold implies damages equivalent to 0,institutional
22 of daily russian gdp,institutional
burgess et al,institutional
2017 study the case of india for the 1957 2000 period and compare it to same results for the us,institutional
they find that 1 additional day over 95 f with respect to the 70 74 f bin in india increases annual mortality by 0,institutional
74 when that increase for the us is of 0,institutional
03 for the same years,institutional
yu et al,institutional
2019 find for china between 2014 2012 that an extra day of heat over 90 f over the 5060 f level increases annual mortality rate by 0,institutional
6 whereas an extra day of cold less than 10 f increases that mortality rate by 0,institutional
the authors also show that climate change raises yearly mortality rates in 2,institutional
4 and 14,institutional
2 in scenarios rcp2,institutional
6 and 8,institutional
using the vsl for china the authors estimate climate change damages that account for 0,institutional
21 and 1,institutional
19 depending on two climate scenario projection,institutional
in addition to the overall mortality result the literature also discusses factors affecting vulnerability to temperature levels hajat kosatky 2010 deschenes 2014 benmarhnia et al,institutional
2015 son et al,institutional
one of the clearer ones is age,institutional
elderly are known to face higher risks from cold and heat which may be due to physiological conditions housing or health access conditions as well as behavioral characteristics,institutional
8 findings suggest higher mortality impact from temperature levels in less qualified employees among black population and unmarried persons son et al,institutional
other individual level modifiers as gender or education do not yield conclusive results whereas lower income individuals tend to be more affected by temperature extremes,institutional
9 the literature analyses other determinants that have to do with community characteristics rather than individual ones,institutional
in that sense there is weak evidence for higher heat related mortality associated with higher population density poor housing facilities and higher pollution levels,institutional
additional factors but also with unsubstantial evidence are higher risks for heat in urban areas in communities with warmer climate places with less proportion of green areas etc,institutional
some few studies also report higher vulnerability to cold weather in regions with warmer climate in places located in lower latitudes and in rural areas burgess et al,institutional
in an attempt to take into account those community factors it is usual to find studies within this literature that test for regional subsamples a,institutional
barreca 2012 and deschnes greenstone 2011 for different regions in the us yu et al,institutional
2019 for different regions in china,institutional
from the available literature reviews it is possible to conclude that except for the age factor the rest of the determinants of temperature mortality sensitivity are location and population sensitive from where the importance of performing local studies,institutional
this study makes two novel contributions,institutional
firstly it adds to the limited existing literature on climatic determinants of mortality in developing countries and in argentina,institutional
a literature review on temperaturerelated mortality between 1980 and 2017 son et al,institutional
2019 show that most of the studies focus on north america europe and asia and many nations including most in latin america and asia had no studies,institutional
argentina is an interesting case in its own right because it has a vast territory with diverse weather,institutional
the wide range of altitudes that go from high mountains along the andes plains on the atlantic coast contribute to that diversity,institutional
10 the weather is mild in the pampas cold in the western patagonia subtropical in the mesopotamia region and warm in the northeast,institutional
along the andes located in the west are the coldest areas with dry and snowy weather,institutional
a few studies have documented the influence of weather on human mortality in argentina,institutional
of those the ones that are closers to our work are almeira et al,institutional
2016 which reports a u shaped relationship between temperature and mortality for the cities of buenos aires and rosario and de garn bejarn 2003 that examines the effect of thermal stress during summertime characterized by the relative strain index on mortality rates in buenos aires city,institutional
11 12 although very informative none of the existing work relating weather conditions and health in argentina perform any economic valuation and this is our first contribution,institutional
secondly we provide estimates of the incidence of climate change on mortality and not only for the link between temperature and death rates,institutional
we do for the whole country i,institutional
a sizable portion of the population breaking the analysis by age and gender groups and using state of the art panel data econometrics,institutional
third we value mortality damages,institutional
in a context of climatic change where resources must be allocated to promote adaptation to the new climate comparable countrywide estimates of health impacts and the corresponding damages are indeed needed to develop a rational and sustainable adaptation policy,institutional
the rest of the paper is organized as follows,institutional
section ii describes the empirical strategy implemented to value mortality impacts due to temperature variations,institutional
section iii describes the data,institutional
section iv shows the estimation results in terms of mortality rate changes consequent deaths and valuation of those impacts as well as the robustness checks we perform,institutional
the last section v summarizes our findings the policy consequences they have and discusses the limitations of our results,institutional
empirical strategy the empirical strategy involves four different steps for the case of argentina,institutional
first estimate a model that relates daily temperature in a recent period with the corresponding mortality rates,institutional
second calculate the change in temperature according to climate change projections,institutional
third estimate deaths attributable to extreme temperatures in the benchmark period as well as the ones resulting from climate change,institutional
fourth value deaths using the value of a statistical life,institutional
benchmark model our benchmark model is described by the following equation 6 1 4 0 1 1 where is the mortality rate per 100 000 inhabitants in municipality or district d which belong to a given state or province in month m in year t for a give age group a,institutional
is the number of days in each district d per month m per year t that fall in each temperature bin j and is the number of days in each district d per month m per year t that fall in each precipitation bin j,institutional
as in several articles in this literature deschnes greenstone 2011 deschenes 2018 the temperature range was divided in 10 degrees fahrenheit f bins,institutional
13 the temperature bin taken as the reference is the one of 70 80 f 21,institutional
6 c that corresponds to the mode of the frequency distribution of days in a month that fall into each of the bins,institutional
then stands for month time effects that allow controlling for potentially confounding effects common to all municipalities that vary overtime for example macroeconomic shocks affecting the countrywide economic performance which might affect health outcomes,institutional
finally is an interaction term which captures temporal variations between municipalities due to differences in air quality income levels educational attainment and population density,institutional
thus these fixed effects could be interpreted as a baseline estimate of mortality rates in each municipality barreca shimshack 2012,institutional
finally is an error term,institutional
note that we use the monthly mortality to avoid the so called harvesting effect i,institutional
we try to avoid the temporal displacement of deaths that occur that after a period of more deaths than expected because of the heat follows a period of mortality deficit because it is likely that heat wave especially affected those whose health weak and so would have died in the short term anyway,institutional
if less than a month was considered we would likely overestimate the impact of temperature on mortality,institutional
our main estimate for the calculation of damages is in which can be read as the change in mr with respect to the mr in the temperature bin of reference when the number of days in each of the other temperature bins varies by 1 with 1 hence 2 since the final unit of analysis is municipality d by month m in a given year t there will be a for each age group a for each temperature bin j,institutional
more specifically we ran a model for all age groups and both genders then we estimate four regressions one for each age group,institutional
in addition we run alternative specifications,institutional
finally we perform some robustness check with the model including temperature and precipitation interactions using the logarithm of the mortality rate and using monthly lagged bins,institutional
13 the precipitation range was partitioned in five bins of 4 millimeters mm of rain,institutional
climate change estimation with the different values for obtained from equation 1 we estimate how climate change modifies in each district d the number of days in a given month m of a certain year t that fall within each bin j using climate scenarios for temperature change predictions for the future as compared to the present period,institutional
with those two inputs in hand the change in the mortality rates due to the modification in the number of days that fit within each bin results from 3 more specifically what is calculated to fulfil the objective of this work is the change in the mortality rates due to the shift in the number of extreme cold c heat h days and both extreme types of weather e as 3 note that c for cold corresponds to j bin 40 f 4,institutional
4 c whereas h for hot is j bin 90 f 32,institutional
number of deaths due to extreme temperature and its change based on the changes in mortality rate from 2 and 3 we calculate the number of deaths that result from each of three circumstances changes in cold days heat days and both extreme temperature days,institutional
first we calculate the number of deaths for the whole country resulting from an extra day within each of the bins with respect to the deaths occurring at the reference temperature bin based on equation 2 12 2010 100 000 4 where is the change in the number of deaths in age group a for each additional day of temperature within each bin j are the estimated coefficients for average monthly mortality rate from equation 1 12 are the number of months in a year this converts monthly mortality to annual mortality 2010 is the population of group a in 2010 it is divided by 100 000 because is the is an average per in 100 000 and is the number of districts in argentina because district that has to be converted to a national estimate 511,institutional
14 second to get the change in the number of deaths attributable to each bin temperature per year we multiply 4 by the average number days in each bin per month during the period used for the estimation of the benchmark model and then by 12 the number of months in a year 100 000 third we estimate the number of deaths attributable to the change in the number of days within each bin following equation 3 as 12 2010 100 000 6 as it is clear from equations 4 6 overall the total effect of climate change on deaths varies by the population within each age group in the whole country and depends on the sensitivity of mortality to colder and hotter periods on the number of cold and hot days in a year and on how this changes when the distribution of temperature shift as the result of climate change,institutional
the economic valuation of such effects is the only step that remains,institutional
mortality damages attributable to temperature extremes and their change finally the calculated in equations 4 6 are valued here using the value of a statistical life,institutional
even when there are non market methods to assess the vsl as we mentioned above they involve detailed data and sophisticated techniques which require resources and knowledge,institutional
this may explain why there are relatively few estimates of vsl for low and middle income countries as this is widely acknowledged in the literature see robinson 2017 among others,institutional
however there is an estimation of the vsl in argentina picassso and conte grand 2019,institutional
the estimation is not in the context of health but of crime,institutional
however we use it as an alternative because it is obtained with local data,institutional
to cover the uncertainty surrounding that applicability of that vsl for this case we opt for an alternative transfer values from studies in other countries,institutional
based on them we adjust vsl from other places policy site denoted by p to argentina which is location of the study s relative per capita income vsl income elasticity as it is usual in the literature brouwer 2000 following and the 7 3,institutional
data the first part of our estimation strategy outlined above relies on data for the 2010 2019 period 15 death counts by administrative subdivision and weather records from meteorological stations argentinean data,institutional
then for the second part of our empirical methodology climate change is captured through the difference between 2010 the year within the interval that corresponds to the last census done in argentina and 2085 distributions of temperature for argentina as described in the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp,institutional
mortality rate the mortality data correspond to the universe of over 4 million deaths across the country in the period as compiled by the direccin de estadsticas e informacin pblica the agency in charge of the national system of health statistics,institutional
the dataset reports each death along with the date of death the gender and age and the municipality of residence of the deceased,institutional
thus death counts were aggregated at the municipal level the smallest administrative subdivision in the dataset,institutional
death counts were supplemented with annual population estimates to construct monthly municipal mortality rates per 100 000 inhabitants by gender and age groups,institutional
specifically following deschnes and greenstone 2011 and barreca et al,institutional
2016 the population was stratified into four age groups 0 4 5 44 45 64 64 year olds,institutional
16 annual population numbers by municipality had to be interpolated from the 2010 national population census,institutional
average mortality rates are per 100 000 approximately 21 inhabitants for children under 5 years of age 8 for people between 5 and 44 years of age 58 for adults between 44 and 65 and 413 for older adults,institutional
one should expect to observe the greatest impacts of extreme temperatures in the last group given that it generally includes the most vulnerable people,institutional
meteorological records weather records were obtained from the servicio meteorolgico nacional the official national weather and climatological agency,institutional
daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degree celsius c as well as total precipitation in millimeters mm are reported for the 71 weather stations that comprise the national weather station network,institutional
the monitoring network might seem to be sparse given the surface area and the degree of development of a country such as argentina,institutional
however according to the 2010 national census the argentinian population is mostly urban with 91 living in towns bigger than 2 000 inhabitants and half of the total population living in just 8 cities,institutional
therefore the 61 weather stations finally included in the analysis provide coverage to approximately 82 of the countrys population,institutional
17 daily station data had to be spatially interpolated at the municipal level to construct monthly weather exposure variables,institutional
following a common approach in the literature square inverse distance weights were calculated from each municipal geographical centroid to each station within a 100 kilometers radius hanigan et al,institutional
thus the interpolated weather variables are simply the weighted average of the stations records within that radius i,institutional
the closest monitoring station to a particular district is given more weight,institutional
limiting the cut off distance to 100 km was necessary to balance the number of municipalities included in the study while minimizing the potential measurement error that would otherwise be introduced by including distant stations,institutional
despite districts were not included because of those reasons they cover 84,institutional
9 per cent of argentinas population,institutional
in general monitoring stations are not located where population is scarce,institutional
similar cut off levels have been used in empirical estimates for the united states deschnes and greenstone 2011 barreca 2012 barreca and shimshack 2012 ranson 2014 barreca et al,institutional
figure 1 show the municipalities included in the study along with the location of the 71 weather stations,institutional
climate change climate change temperature data comes from the nasa earth exchange global daily downscaled projections nex gddp,institutional
that database has daily minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation for the whole planet,institutional
the temporal coverage is from 1950 to 2014 historical data and 2015 to 2100 projected shared socioeconomic pathways rcp 4,institutional
5 and rcp 8,institutional
the rcp 4,institutional
5 is a moderate scenario where some effort to curb climate change is made but temperatures rise 2,institutional
7c globally by the end of the century whereas rcp 8,institutional
5 projects that the global economy grows fueled by exploiting fossil fuels and energy intensive lifestyles and by 2100 the average global temperature is 4,institutional
note that the temperature by 2050 under the 8,institutional
5 scenarios would be similar to that of the 4,institutional
5 projection to the end of the century,institutional
the spatial resolution of nex gddp is approximately 25 degrees x 25 degrees,institutional
we took the daily information for temperature available within the geographical limits of argentina and average it for both 2010 and 2085,institutional
18 then as previously the temperatures are assigned to each municipality,institutional
figure 2 shows the shift in days within each temperature bin if the projected climate change takes place,institutional
what happens in that case is that as expected the average temperature increases and the number of cold days decreases while the number of hot days increases,institutional
19 scenario 8,institutional
5 since it projects more climate change shows a higher number of hot days than the 4,institutional
those changes are not uniform across the whole country figure a,institutional
2 in appendix,institutional
valuation finally for the value of a statistical life we use an estimation for argentina from picasso and conte grand 2019 that to our knowledge is the only one derived from local data,institutional
in addition for robustness check we transfer the vsl from estimates in the us viscusi and masterman 2017 and from a global study by the world bank in association with the institute of health metric and evaluation world bank and ihme 2016,institutional
the local vsl is 1 5 million corresponding to 2014 table 1,institutional
the original us estimate is 9,institutional
6 million 2014 dollars which transferred using the argentina to us relative gdp per capita yields a value of 2,institutional
20 similarly the world bank estimate for oecd countries is 3,institutional
8 million which transferred to argentina becomes 1,institutional
we update the estimates to 2019 dollars which is the last year of our mortality data and transfer them to argentinas case adjusting by the relative gdp ratio among countries,institutional
because of the uncertainty surrounding what is the best vsl we perform a montecarlo simulation,institutional
to do so we assume a triangular distribution for vsl with a minimum value a maximum value and a mode of 1,institutional
72 and 1,institutional
results this section is divided in two subsections,institutional
the first shows the estimates for the mortality rate temperature impacts for the whole population by age groups in the 2010 2019 period,institutional
the second subsection uses the estimated relationships to predict the impacts on annual deaths due to temperature extremes its variation due to climate changes and their valuation,institutional
mortality rates the changes in mortality rates attributable to the 2010 2019 temperature profile are summarized in figure 3,institutional
that figure presents the estimated exposure impacts computed by nonparametric regressions between mortality rates and temperature at the municipal level controlling for precipitation levels and fixed effects by month and municipality by month i,institutional
equation 1 for all age groups genders and regions,institutional
the results must be interpreted as the relative impact of daily mean temperature over annual mortality due to an additional day in a given month with temperature above or below the observed mode temperature bin during the 2010 2019 period i,institutional
the 70 80 f or 21,institutional
6 c bin,institutional
any day with a mean daily temperature above the reference temperature positively and significantly affects mortality rates,institutional
days in the extreme cold temperatures 40 f bin also shows a significant excess mortality with respect to the reference temperature,institutional
the u shape is usual in the literature deschenes and greenstone 2011 for example,institutional
but the u is not always perfectly symmetric,institutional
as figure 3 suggests for argentina the estimated impacts of colder thanaverage temperatures are slightly higher than the computed estimates for hotter than average temperatures,institutional
in other countries as mexico the higher impacts are also associated to cold and slightly below mean temperature days rather than to heat cohen and dechezlepretre 2020,institutional
22 more precisely a cold day average temperature below 10 c cause 3,institutional
5 fives more excess mortality than a heat day the last row of panel a in table 2 shows the same result as figure 3 in a more detailed way,institutional
on average an additional day with a relative cold day one with a countrywide mean temperature between 30 and 40 f 4,institutional
4 c increases the population weighted average monthly mortality rate in 0,institutional
633 each 100 000 inhabitants with respect to the mortality for a day with the reference temperature and that increase is significant,institutional
on the other side an extra relatively hot day 90 f or 32,institutional
2 c significantly increases that mortality rate by 0,institutional
515 in 100 000,institutional
delivering for people and the planet human capital gender and climate change climate change is eroding human capital across the life cycle hurting peoples potential and affecting men women and vulnerable groups in different ways,institutional
promoting green resilient and inclusive development requires addressing gender human capital and climate priorities together,institutional
the world bank group is supporting countries to invest in human capital including the poor and the vulnerable as well as women to increase their resilience to a changing climate,institutional
by investing in human capital and promoting gender equality countries can provide their people with the skills and abilities to drive climate mitigation meet the demands of the green economy and ensure a just transition for all,institutional
the challenge climate change is eroding human capital at all stages of life with long lasting implications for peoples well being and economic productivity,institutional
climate shocks reinforce pre existing poverty traps threaten to increase poverty levels and deepen inequalities globally,institutional
i shocks early in life affect a childs wellbeing and impact productivity in adulthood,institutional
extreme heat for example is directly linked to increased hospitalization during pregnancy chronic and acute malnutrition in early childhood lower test scores amongst school age children a global loss of 470 billion work hours among adults in 2021 as well as over 300 000 deaths of people over 65 in 2019,institutional
ii many of these impacts constrain economic potential and affect men and women in different ways,institutional
for women the impacts of climate change are clearest in their economic activities,institutional
women are more likely to earn a living from natural resource based or climate vulnerable sectors,institutional
while both men and women will be affected pre existing inequities may cause women to benefit less from the growth in green jobs as economies decarbonize without deliberate inclusive policies,institutional
human capital investment and gender sensitive policies offer the opportunity to mitigate the impacts of climate change build adaptive capacity and harness the skills needed for a green and inclusive economy,institutional
if tackled strategically the transition to a low carbon economy offers a chance to dismantle current inequities in the labor markets and create human capital gains from reduced air pollution and other environmental co benefits,institutional
withstanding climate induced setbacks to human capital and supporting the climate transition with impactful investments in human capital will help realize the promise of productivity and green growth,institutional
what is needed,institutional
action and increased investment are needed now to improve peoples adaptive capacity,institutional
basic investment in education and healthcare build resilience as people with high levels of human capital have more tools to withstand shocks,institutional
greater awareness of climate change can also spur behavioral change,institutional
iii strong disaster risk management and disease surveillance systems underpinned by robust data are crucial to minimize adverse impacts and guide an appropriate policy response,institutional
iv well targeted social protection helps to ensure basic levels of consumption protect people in times of crisis encourage people to diversify into livelihoods that are less climate vulnerable allow labor market transitions and promote savings to guard against shocks,institutional
investments in human capital will allow men and women to manage and benefit from the climate transition while tackling current inequities,institutional
job losses are expected in carbon intensive industries but there are opportunities too,institutional
v world bank research estimates that climate business can generate 213 million cumulative jobs around the world between 2020 and 2030,institutional
vi investments in renewable electricity energy efficiency charging infrastructure for electric vehicles green hydrogen supply chains and climate smart urban transport systems can simultaneously both abate emissions and create jobs in a cost effective manner,institutional
however these sectors require strong technical skills,institutional
to enable poor countries and poor people globally to reap the benef its of the transition to a low carbon economy education and skills curricula will need to provide job relevant skills for new opportunities for example in renewable energy as well as research in climate change innovation through increased r d,institutional
vii the transition to greener jobs also provides an opportunity to reduce economic gender gaps by overcoming social norms around traditionally male dominated sectors promoting womens stem skills and expanding access to childcare,institutional
climate proofing and decarbonizing human development service delivery protects critical services and promotes green solutions,institutional
globally the health sector contributes an estimated five percent of national emissions,institutional
health service reform can deliver mitigation through energy efficiency and decarbonization of energy supplies,institutional
resource efficient health centers schools and other social service delivery infrastructure will lower emissions and increase system resilience to limit the interruption of health education and social protection services during climate shocks,institutional
in all policy areas successful climate action requires involving people in the reform process to ensure a just transition,institutional
the green transition will create winners and losers in the labor market,institutional
meaningful consultation and labor policies will help build social support for climate policies ensure that programs better meet peoples human capital needs while also improving climate outcomes,institutional
womens empowerment and leadership are central to effective climate action associated with better resource governance conservation outcomes disaster readiness and the adoption of more climate friendly decisions in the private sector,institutional
how is the world bank group contributing to solutions,institutional
the world bank group wbg is investing in human capital to protect people from the adverse impacts of climate change to build their resilience and capacity to adjust during the transition and to use their human capital to driveand thrive ina low carbon economy,institutional
wbg green investments also connect human capital and gender across the key systems of energy agriculture food water and land cities transport and manufacturing,institutional
protect the world bank supports countries to protect people from the worst impacts of climate change,institutional
adaptive social protection and climate smart health and education systems build resilience and mitigate climate shocks,institutional
upstream capacity to respond effectively and quickly in times of crises minimizes negative impacts and can reduce gender vulnerability,institutional
as of june 2022 the world bank had financed social protection programs in 60 countries including 17 billion in the worlds poorest countries,institutional
many of these programskenya the philippines the sahel region senegal sierra leone and solomon islands to name a fewfocus on building adaptive social protection systems as well as resilience programs for women,institutional
ix such programs in niger for example increased beneficiary incomes by 60 to 100 percent,institutional
similarly a 500 million development policy operation in morocco aims to improve protection against health risks human capital losses during childhood and poverty in old age as well as improving climate risk management and resilience,institutional
world bank operations improve climate resilience of education and health systems,institutional
for example in fy22 alone world bank financed human development projects invested roughly 670 million in djibouti ethiopia the gambia and south sudan to strengthen health systems with climate smart design,institutional
the world bank also supports projects for green and resilient school facilities such as in romania where education buildings serving 17 500 pupils will become more energy efficient and resilient to climate related hazards,institutional
the world bank has developed analytics and assessment tools in the human development sectors to analyze the risks to and resilience of people and service delivery systems to inform climate related investments,institutional
the climate health vulnerability assessment and climate and health and economic valuation tool identify potential climate related health shocks outline their costs and how to strengthen systems to respond to them,institutional
the social protection stress test has helped over 22 countries assess their readiness to scale up social protection in crises,institutional
a skills profiling and transition pathways diagnostic tool developed for polands coal regions profiles worker skills and preferences to inform potential matching to alternative jobs,institutional
also a tool that will holistically assess the impacts of climate change on the human capital sectors is under development,institutional
build the world bank supports countries to build human capital for women and men to thrive in greener economies,institutional
people need a solid foundation in health and education to achieve their full potential,institutional
strengthening the skills of women and excluded groups can promote inclusion help unlock climate change innovations and meet labor supply shortages,institutional
social safety nets help poor people invest in the education and health of the next generation,institutional
environmental education fosters foundational skills and behavior change for climate awareness and social resilience,institutional
in countries as diverse as indonesia tonga and uganda the world bank supports reforms to school and teacher training curricula that create foundational knowledge on greenhouse gas reduction changing patterns of rain and floods emergency responses to cyclones and floods thereby building resilience to disasters and climate change,institutional
climate smart education systems also develop skills necessary for climate mitigation,institutional
technical and vocational training research in climate change innovation in higher education and establishing green centers of excellence can accelerate green economic transformation,institutional
in india the world bank financing supports competitive research grants in climate related research and development,institutional
several initiatives specifically aim to increase girls and womens education including stem and expand opportunities to access green jobs,institutional
these include programs in nepal and pakistan,institutional
multisectoral world bank programs in climate resilient nutrition are a foundational investment to build human capital,institutional
in the last five years the world bank has supported nutrition through health systems in djibouti india madagascar mozambique philippines and yemen,institutional
social protection and education programs in haiti honduras and somalia among others provide complementary services to improve nutrition,institutional
use the world bank group helps reimagine how people live and work adapting to and mitigating climate change,institutional
green and just transitions require using human capital effectively and could increase womens employment in renewable technology,institutional
diversification and adaptation in agriculture and livelihoods will be critical as people navigate the green economy,institutional
social safety nets and labor market programs facilitate this transition minimizing the risks of exploring new jobs and opportunities,institutional
the world bank supports 157 economic inclusion programs that build resilience,institutional
x spread mainly across low income countries these programs focus on improving resources management and green jobs,institutional
working to facilitate a green transition for poor households people receive reskilling labor intermediation or migrant services as well as help in investing in sustainable agri food value chains,institutional
the world bank supports womens economic empowerment for a green transition,institutional
in south asia the middle east and north africa the world bank partners with civil society businesses and donors to support womens labor force participation in water and clean energy aiming to get more women into these value chains through investments in stem school to work transition and childcare,institutional
ifcs powered by women program in asia pacific and energy2equal in africa work with renewable energy companies on gender smart solutions including hiring more women in leadership and technical roles,institutional
miga is engaged with private sector energy companies in sub saharan africa to help improve womens access to clean energy and their leadership and employment opportunities,institutional
world bank analysis informs the just transition for all with policy frameworks to help affected workers in india indonesia philippines and south africa,institutional
xi the world bank is preparing to support workers at the komati power plant with reskilling and upskilling labor market programs to transition to new jobs and connections with social protection programs,institutional
green public works financed by the world bank in ethiopia fiji malawi and mozambique among others provide jobs for the poor while rebuilding ecosystems and reforesting communities,institutional
in 12 countries world bank operations enable indigenous and local women leaders to enhance income opportunities in and around forests investing in local sustainable and socially inclusive enterprises to drive climate change solutions,institutional
xiii what will success look like,institutional
success is putting people at the center of the climate change agenda ensuring that policies capture the full costs and benefits to people,institutional
proactive citizen engagement around national climate policies will enhance the likelihood that countries can achieve their goals,institutional
wbg tools will help governments quantify the costs and opportunities of climate reforms to peoples health education jobs and overall well being to inform evidenced based policy making,institutional
governments should have the support they need to ensure that their human capital policies and programs are effectively financed to meet the needs of the green resilient inclusive economy and to integrate gender equality,institutional
climate adaptation should focus first on those people who are most affected by and vulnerable to climate change,institutional
there are many opportunities to deliver for both people and the planet,institutional
green public works are just one example providing income for poor households while improving the environment,institutional

over the past two years nine out of 10 countries have slid backwards on the un s human development index,media
covid 19 the war in ukraine and the impact of climate change are blamed for putting global development in reverse,media
the human development index was launched in 1990 in an effort to look beyond gdp as a measure of well being,media
switzerland sits at the top of the index this year with a life expectancy of 84 years an average of 16,media
5 years spent in education and median salary of 66 000,media
at the other end of the scale is south sudan where life expectancy is 55 people spend just 5,media
5 years in school on average and earn 768 a year,media
setbacks in a majority of the 191 countries included in the index especially in life expectancy have taken development levels back to those seen in 2016 reversing a 30 year trend,media
in the us for example life expectancy at birth has dropped by more than two years since 2019,media
in other countries the decline is much higher,media
over the years since the index was introduced many countries have faced crises and slid backwards but the global trend consistently moved upwards,media
last year was the first time the index declined overall since calculations began and this year s results solidified that downward trend,media
the impact has been uneven though,media
two thirds of rich countries rebounded last year while most others continued to decline,media
this year s index is based on data from 2021,media
but the outlook for 2022 is grim says achim steiner one of its authors who points out that more than 80 countries are facing problems paying off their national debt,media
eighty countries being one step away from facing that kind of crisis is a very serious prospect he says,media
we are seeing deep disruptions the tail end of which will play out over a number of years,media

with dry seasons now becoming longer women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support,media
they become more vulnerable,media
it s very hard work ibrahim recently told the s 100 women initiative,media
a global problem it is not just women in rural areas who are affected,media
globally women are more likely to experience poverty and to have less socioeconomic power than men,media
this makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure jobs and housing,media

as sea levels rise low lying cities like new orleans will be increasingly at risk,media
in new orleans there was much higher poverty among the african american population before katrina says jacquelyn litt professor of women s and gender studies at rutgers university,media
more than half the poor families in the city were headed by single mothers she told news,media
are reliant on interdependent community networks for their everyday survival and resources,media
the displacement that happened after katrina essentially eroded those networks,media
it places women and their children at much greater risk,media
in the immediate aftermath of extreme events emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women,media

getty images katrina impact women and children waiting to be evacuated outside the new orleans superdome increased incidences of violence against women including sexual assault and rape have also been documented in the wake of disasters,media

disasters do not affect all people equally,media
in the wake of the 2004 tsunami an oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3 1 in sri lanka indonesia and india,media
while no one cause was clear there were similar patterns across the region,media
men were more likely to be able to swim and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives,media
another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women s life expectancy more than men more women were being killed or they were being killed younger,media
in countries where women had greater socioeconomic power the difference reduced,media

com five ways that climate change threatens human health 242711 link copied share article as the un s climate summit cop29 gets underway in azerbaijan this week the effect of climate change on human health is high on the agenda,media
and rightly so amid some alarming emerging statistics,media
by the end of this century climate change could be the cause of more than 3 million deaths per year around five times as many annual deaths globally of hiv and aids,media
a new report from a scientific review committee of experts called the lancet countdown highlights how globally people are facing record breaking threats to their health as a consequence of climate change,media
the major climate risks include negative effects on food security including production spread of diseases ecosystems infrastructure and the economy,media
despite having contributed the least to global emissions africa will be most affected by climate change,media
this is due to the fragile economics and exposure to extreme weather events across much of the continent,media
but all continents including europe will be negatively affected,media
everyone working in health needs to prepare for and be equipped to respond to the health consequences of the climate crisis,media
the lancet highlights the opportunity to redefine the social and environmental determinants of health,media
these are the top five priorities when it comes to climate change and human health 1,media
new and emerging infectious diseases drastic environmental change increases the risk of catching deadly infectious diseases such as malaria dengue and west nile virus in new areas,media
modelling shows that mosquito populations could move into different regions of africa and south america and into europe,media
the parasitic ticks that transmit the crimean congo haemorrhagic fever virus may move north from africa into europe as climate change takes hold,media
the threat of outbreaks of new and emerging infections and pandemics is increasing,media
in 2022 the world health organization warned that ebola outbreaks around africa are becoming more frequent due to climate change as bats the likely source of the virus migrate and seek new habitats to breed,media
infectious diseases are predicted to spread more easily due to climate change and thus increase the risk of pandemics,media
this threat includes lassa fever a virus thought to be transmitted by rats,media
modelling has indicated that the rats may flee fire and flood find new habitats and thus expose greater numbers of humans to new or different viruses,media
food security and nutrition climate change exacerbates food insecurity,media
in ghana west africa inconsistent rainfall during the 2024 rainy season has left an estimated 1,media
05 million people acutely food insecure,media
this is the case particularly in the north of the country an area already with a high level of food insecurity and hunger,media
the un predicts that more than 600 million people will be living in hunger by 2030 due to the impact of climate shocks and lack of aid and government action thus far,media
climate change worsens food insecurity from many different angles from rural farmers in ghana losing their crops due to unexpected changes in rainfall to the impact of affordability of imports in the uk there won t be just hunger hotspots,media
as food insecurity deteriorates so will malnutrition globally,media
by 2030 between 570 000 and 1 million children under five years old will suffer from stunted growth due to climate change also exacerbating their vulnerability to infectious diseases such as malaria,media
access to healthcare extreme weather can physically prevent people from accessing healthcare,media
between 2014 and 2023 61 of land globally experienced an increase in the number of days of extreme rainfall compared to 1961 1990,media
flash floods have devastated valencia in spain with health services anticipating increases in diarrhoea skin infections and hepatitis a,media
evidence from ghana shows that physical access to healthcare is restricted with patients and sometimes health workers unable to reach local health centres and emergency referrals unable to reach hospitals,media
access to healthcare provision becomes harder during extreme weather conditions,media
riccardo mayer shutterstock the lancet report also found that only two thirds of countries had high or very high implementation of legally required health emergency plans,media
this number needs to be 100 to protect population health as extreme weather events become more frequent unpredictable and severe,media
delays to reduce carbon emissions and attempt to rectify the situation are only adding to the issue,media
global energy related carbon emissions reached a new high in 2023 showing little signs of slowing down,media
in a 2023 study conducted in mion northern ghana nearly all participants reported not being able to access a healthcare facility when they needed to at least once due to climatic conditions,media
similarly in the volta region in ghana many residents lost all their belongings during unexpected flooding in 2023 including health insurance documents,media
this means people cannot access vital medications or services such as insulin if diabetic or emergency care,media
air quality air quality is one of the most locally felt impacts of climate change especially in heavily industrialised countries,media
the uk health security agency estimates that around 36 000 deaths annually are attributable to air pollution in the uk with this number jumping to 2 million in china,media
this is in part due to causing new or exacerbating existing chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease which one in five people suffer with in the uk,media
it also reduces life expectancy through prolonged exposure causing diseases such as coronary heart disease and lung cancer,media
extreme heat in 2023 increased heat exposure put those engaged in outdoor physical activity which includes everything from agricultural labour to recreational running at risk of heat stress for 28 more hours than two decades ago,media
heat stress has been associated with debilitating issues such as kidney stones exhaustion asthma and heart attacks,media
any amount of activity or movement in rising temperatures will put individuals at great risk of these conditions,media
this will compromise income if labour is based outdoors population health if we can do less outside and the ability to enjoy the outdoor world,media

and what would it take to achieve this in practice,media
on the art of prolonging life was penned by a dr huseland one of the soundest minds in germany in 1797 concluding eight years of study on the topic,media
he identified among the many factors associated with long life a moderate diet that was rich in vegetables and short on meat and sweetened pastries an active lifestyle good care of your teeth weekly bathing in lukewarm water with soap good sleep clean air and being born to parents who themselves lived long lives,media
toward the end of his essay translated for the american review the doctor wistfully speculated that human life may be prolonged to double the extent of what is supposed to be its present limits without losing activity and usefulness,media
by huseland s estimates half of all children born would die before their tenth birthday an alarmingly high mortality rate,media
however if the child could run the gauntlet of youth fraught with smallpox measles rubella and other childhood diseases they stood a fair chance of making it all the way to their mid thirties,media
in ideal circumstances huseland thought it possible that a lifetime could stretch for two hundred years,media
is there more to these claims than the fanciful imagination of an 18th century doctor,media
james vaupel doesn t think it s out of the question,media
life expectancy is increasing two and a half years every decade he says,media
that s twenty five years every century,media
as director of the laboratory of survival and longevity at the max planck institute for demographic research in rostock germany vaupel studies longevity and survival in human and animal populations,media
he tells me that the pattern of improvements to mortality has shifted greatly in the past 100 years,media
before 1950 most of the gains in life expectancy were made by combating the high infant mortality that huseland noted,media
since then however it s been the over 60s and most recently the over 80s who ve seen the greatest decreases in mortality,media
in other words we are not just surviving childhood in greater numbers we re living longer a lot longer,media
age complex worldwide the number of centenarians people over the age of 100 is predicted to increase 10 fold between 2010 and 2050,media
as huseland testified a strong component in whether you ll live to see this milestone lies in the age of your parents that is there is a genetic component to long life,media
but the rise in centenarians can t be explained by genetics alone which clearly haven t changed much in the last couple of centuries,media
rather it s a host of improvements to our lives that cumulatively improve our chances of living longer and stronger many of which echo the factors identified by huseland,media
the reasons include better healthcare improving medical treatments public health measures like cleaner water and air better education and improved standards of living such as houses that are warm and dry,media
mostly it s down to having more medicine and money says vaupel,media
recent decades have seen significant improvements in life expectancy for the elderly thinkstock nonetheless the gains offered by better healthcare and living conditions still leave many people dissatisfied and the appetite for life extension therapies shows no sign of abating,media
one popular approach is caloric restriction,media
in the 1930s researchers noticed that mice fed on a near starvation diet lived far longer than those allowed to eat until full,media
a subsequent study on rhesus monkeys also showed this but this was contradicted by a 20 year long study by the us national institute on ageing which found that although rhesus monkeys kept on a calorie restricted diet developed age related diseases slightly later than controls they did not live longer on average,media
the authors noted that though caloric restriction in long lived animals conferred some benefits these were subject to a complex interplay of genetics nutrition and environmental factors,media
another great hope is resveratrol a chemical produced naturally by plants notably in the skin of grapes,media
whether vineyards can be said to hide the fountain of youth however remains doubtful,media
the chemical has been noted to produce similar health benefits to caloric restriction in animal models but as yet no study has shown that taking resveratrol can increase human lifespan,media
no limits but why do we age at all,media
every day we suffer damage and don t perfectly repair it explains vaupel and this accumulation of unrepaired damage is what causes age related disease,media
it s not a trait that is shared by all living organisms,media
hydra for example a group of simple jellyfish like creatures are able to repair almost all the damage they suffer and readily slough cells that are too injured to heal,media
in humans it s damaged cells like these that can give rise to cancerous tumours,media
hydras allocate resources primarily toward repair rather than reproduction says vaupel,media
humans by contrast primarily direct resources toward reproduction it s a different survival strategy at a species level,media
humans may live fast and die young but our prodigious fertility allows us to overcome these high mortality rates,media
now that infant mortality is so low there s really no need to channel so many resources into reproduction says vaupel,media
the trick is to up regulate repair instead of diverting that energy into getting fat,media
in theory that should be possible though nobody has any idea about how to do it,media
if the steady accretion of damage to our cells can be arrested so called negligible senescence then perhaps we won t have an upper age limit,media
if that s the case there isn t any reason why we should have to die at all,media
hydra can repair almost all its damaged cells shedding any that are too injured to heal science photo library it would be wonderful to get to a world where all death is optional,media
right now essentially all of us are sentenced to the death penalty even though most of us have done nothing to deserve it,media
so says gennady stolyarov transhumanist philosopher and author of death is wrong a controversial children s book that encourages young minds to reject the fatalist notion that death is inevitable,media
stolyarov is fervently opposed to what he sees is simply a technological challenge waiting for the appropriate level of money and manpower to solve it,media
agents of change one focus for technological intervention are telomeres,media
these caps on chromosomes shorten every time your cells divide putting a hard limit on the number of times your cells can reproduce themselves,media
not all animals experience this telomere shortening the hydra being one of them,media
however there are good reasons to have these limitations in place,media
occasional mutations can allow cells to divide without shortening their telomeres giving rise to immortal cell lines,media
however in an uncontrolled situation these immortal cells would be very bad news for the person they are in bloating into cancerous tumours,media
one hundred and fifty thousand people in the world die each day two thirds of those die from causes related to senescence stolyarov tells me,media
so even if we can hasten the arrival of these technologies to achieve negligible senescence by one day we will have saved a hundred thousand lives,media
the author quotes geronotology theoretician aubrey de grey something of a celebrity in the world of life extension as stating that there is a 50 chance of achieving negligible senescence in the next 25 years,media
there s a good chance that it will happen in our lifetimes before we experience the most deleterious effects of senescence says stolyarov,media
achieving negligible human senescence in 25 years is possible says vaupel but highly unlikely,media
he concedes that it might be possible to rapidly accelerate life expectancy through medical breakthroughs,media
but he warns that equally there may be difficulties in the future that we don t anticipate,media
disease economic crisis and climate change might cause increases in mortality he says,media
telomeres the protective ends of chromosomes are linked to ageing of cells science photo library stolyarov is hoping to kindle a small spark of hope into an eternal flame,media
what i think is necessary right now is a determined push to dramatically accelerate the pace of technological progress he says,media
we have a fighting chance right now but in order to make it happen we have to be the agents of change,media
for now readers will have to take comfort in the knowledge that there are well documented ways to try to avoid the western world s two biggest killers heart disease and cancer through a combination of exercise healthy eating and moderation when it comes to alcohol and red meat,media
very few of us actually manage to live by these criteria perhaps because we think a shorter life filled with rich food and wine is a worthy trade,media
which leads to the conundrum if eternal life was possible would you be willing to pay the price,media

com why we need to talk about older people and climate change in africa 239107 link copied share article africa is often viewed as a relatively young continent with less than 7 of the population over 60,media
but this is set to change,media
declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy mean that by 2050 the number of people over 60 in africa is projected to triple to 235 million about 9 of the african population,media
this demographic shift is occurring when global climate change is intensifying leading to more frequent and severe extreme weather events such as heatwaves flooding and tropical cyclones,media
by 2050 older adults in africa are projected to face significantly higher heat exposure due to rapid population growth and climate change with an increase in extreme heat events,media
this will heighten health risks and put pressure on local services especially in low income areas with limited ability to cope with the strain,media
as we age it gets harder to control body temperature,media
longtime health issues like heart and lung disease and diabetes make older people more likely to become dehydrated,media
in africa many older people struggle to get the physical mental social and financial support they need to cope with the direct and indirect effects of extreme weather,media
urgent strategies are therefore needed to protect older people from extreme weather such as heatwaves,media
these include cooling infrastructure air conditioning and early warning systems that tell older people when it is getting dangerously hot,media
climate change adaptation plans must be integrated with policies on ageing to protect older people,media
i research climate gerontology the intersection between ageing and climate change,media
as part of my research i am undertaking a series of global ageing and climate change regional dialogues in collaboration with helpage international,media
here are the key issues we found in africa,media
climate change is harsh on older people older people vary in health and mobility,media
some older individuals remain active and healthy allowing them to cope better with the disruptions caused by extreme weather,media
other less active older adults tend to be vulnerable to climate related threats because of weaker physical health reduced mobility and higher risk of existing disease,media
heat can be deadly for older people,media
adam kaz getty images in africa older people are at greater risk because the continent has limited basic infrastructure,media
this is especially the case in rural areas where access to healthcare clean water and emergency services is often poor,media
poverty living alone and depending on small scale farming make them even more susceptible to extreme weather,media
the impact of climate change disproportionately affects the continent resulting in severe floods droughts and unprecedented heatwaves,media
in 2023 alone about 15 700 people were killed in extreme weather disasters in africa and a further 34 million people affected,media
storm daniel caused widespread devastation in libya displacing 2,media
4 million people,media
kenya somalia and ethiopia experienced intense rainfall and flooding,media
northern africa faced record breaking heat with temperatures reaching 49,media
0 c in tunisia and 50,media
4 c in algeria,media
severe droughts hit morocco algeria and zambia affecting millions,media
prolonged droughts and crop failures make food shortages worse and mean that older people are unable to access healthy nutritious food,media
floods contribute to displacement and difficulties in accessing healthcare resulting in stress and anxiety,media
older people are also affected by the digital divide,media
not having as much access to digital tools like smartphones means they cannot always get the information they need,media
they may not be able to see climate change education programmes or get early warnings of extreme weather,media
solutions traditional knowledge this is the understanding and practices that older people in africa have gained over generations about their local environment,media
it includes knowing about climate patterns resource use and disaster preparedness,media
recognising this valuable knowledge can help communities adapt to climate change and strengthen local community resilience,media
regular assessments local authorities and community organisations must monitor how older people are coping with climate impacts,media
this will lead to more effective adaptation strategies that make use of their insights,media
healthy ageing older people need support to take care of their bodies minds and social lives so that they can stay active and remain independent,media
healthy ageing helps prevent illness and disabilities and allows older adults to connect with communities and cope with extreme weather,media
one stop shops for older people these should be set up by community based organisations charities and government agencies to provide services such as financial assistance healthcare and nutrition support specifically tailored for older people,media
they could also train older people to adapt to climate change,media
involve older people in climate adaptation through their local organisations older people should be involved in disaster risk reduction plans,media
older people have already played vital roles in climate adaptation efforts across africa,media
in kenya their mobilisation for national tree planting initiatives shows what a great contribution older people can make to the environment,media
a group of different generations also works together in kenya on agriculture for the aged planting climate resilient crops to cope with unpredictable weather patterns,media
policy changes needed for these solutions to become a reality policies and budgets are needed,media
first policymakers should consult older people and their representatives when they draw up climate resilience strategies,media
region specific strategies are best,media
for example when setting up community based early warning systems for extreme weather events local authorities could work with non governmental organisations to create a system that provides timely alerts aimed at older people,media
second age friendly infrastructure such as accessible healthcare facilities and housing that can withstand extreme weather must be set up,media
read more why older people are some of those worst affected by climate change third stronger laws and political commitment will result in stronger policies for older people,media
the lack of political will often results in insufficient attention and resources being allocated to the needs of older people in climate action,media
without strong commitment from policymakers older populations are frequently overlooked,media
this limits their ability to adapt effectively,media
fourth social protection systems such as cash transfer programmes must be improved to give financial help to vulnerable older people,media
programmes that provide direct support and jobs in projects that protect against climate impacts are also a good idea,media
to make this happen governments and institutions must start collecting more data on how older people are affected by climate change,media
by developing inclusive policies we can promote healthy ageing while empowering older adults to play an active role in building climate resilience,media

com climate change health risks will hit the poor hardest so what can be done 64929 link copied share article discussions about climate change and the effects it will have on public health and the global burden of disease have been long in the making,media
these consequences are now starting to come to fore,media
several examples have recently played out,media
for example in russia an anthrax outbreak in the remote region of siberia meant that nomadic communities and thousands of reindeer were affected,media
the outbreak was due to the bodies of infected people buried in 1941 defrosting and releasing anthrax spores into the water system as the permafrost defrosts with global warming,media
closer to home prisoners are starving in malawian jails and suffering from acute severe malnutrition as a result of food shortages due to erratic climate conditions from both droughts and floods,media
malawi has since declared a state of national disaster,media
these unanticipated public health consequences of unsustainable development reminds the world that the issues are not in the distant future but instead face us now,media
climate change exerts its influence on public health through three main mechanisms,media
first the effects of extreme weather events such as heat storms floods or fire that directly cause loss of life or illness,media
second there are indirect effects of climate change on natural systems,media
this leads to for example changes in disease vectors such as mosquitoes that spread malaria availability of fresh water crop survival or the concentration of pollen in the air,media
third the effects on economic and social systems as people migrate or conflict over scarce resources,media
these effects can be moderated by the presence of early warning systems and effective disaster and emergency medical services,media
more affluent communities with more resources will be better able to adapt and withstand these effects,media
having strong primary healthcare systems will also increase the resilience of communities,media
but in sub saharan africa many communities do not have these protective mechanisms in place and will be particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change,media
electricity pylons in front of cooling towers at the lethabo thermal power station an eskom coal burning power station near sasolburg in the northern free state province,media
siphiwe sibeko disease and environmental health the world health organisation has recently published a new report on the burden of disease due to modifiable environmental risks,media
the report estimates that 23 of all deaths globally can be attributed to environmental risks,media
this percentage rises to 26 in children,media
these environmental risks include air water and soil pollution ultraviolet radiation the built environment the occupational environment agricultural methods and climate and ecosystem changes,media
children the elderly and those living in low and middle income countries are most at risk,media
the diseases that make the greatest environmentally attributable contribution to the global burden of disease are stroke ischaemic heart disease diarrhoea lower respiratory tract infection cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,media
and over the last ten years the contribution of non communicable diseases has significantly increased,media
an example in south africa is from mpumalanga s highveld which has 12 coal fired power stations,media
the collective air pollution from these power stations has been reported as being responsible for just over half of the deaths from respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease in the area,media
living differently sustainable development has been defined as development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,media
the united nations sustainable development goals recognise that improving the wellbeing and health of people requires an approach that protects the planet from degradation,media
this is required because there are ecological limits to development that is based on ever increasing consumption,media
but the climate crisis is just one of the manifestations of the world s collective inability to live sustainably,media
there is also a loss of ecosystems and the biodiversity,media
this compromises the natural services they render to humanity food fresh water clean air building materials and even new medicines,media
economic inequality is increasing,media
it is reported that 62 people now own as much wealth as 50 of the planet s population,media
at the same time we have seen unprecedented population growth and increasing urbanisation that is characterised by the growth of slums or informal settlements,media
the 21st century challenge humanity s biggest challenge in the 21st century may be its ability to find a way of living sustainably and to tackle the crises of both planetary and public health,media
this will require action on a global scale by world leaders and by a change in collective consciousness,media
there are some encouraging signs,media
brazil has joined china and the us in ratifying the paris agreement on tackling climate change,media
china and the us are responsible for 38 of global emissions,media
world religious leaders have also joined forces to promote a change of consciousness as part of a season of creation,media

com ghanas health system isnt quite ready for climate change realities 122912 link copied share article climate change has been labelled as the greatest public health risk of the 21st century,media
health risks from climate change are expected to become increasingly severe in the coming years,media
they threaten the many advances being made in global public health,media
several health risks are anticipated from climate change,media
these include increases of vector borne and diarrhoeal diseases,media
there are also changes in the geographic range of infectious diseases,media
this means a spread into new regions the emergence of new infectious diseases and reemergence of old ones,media
an increase in the intensity of infectious diseases in already endemic regions is also expected,media
although climate change is a global threat the potential risks are relatively higher in developing economies,media
these countries have overburdened and weak health systems coupled with persistently poor health infrastructure,media
it s anticipated that some of the worst effects of climate change will be felt in sub saharan africa,media
for example climatic change has been reported as a driving force for the malaria highland invasion in the east african highlands,media
it is crucial that countries public health systems are able to cope with climate sensitive diseases,media
the world health organisation who has acknowledged this and has outlined a range of mitigating measures,media
it identifies rebuilding public health capacity among the most important cost effective and urgent responses to climate change,media
this includes training in climate change and health to strengthen the technical and professional capacity of health personnel,media
effective surveillance and emergency response systems also need to be put in place coupled with sustainable prevention and control programmes,media
in addition countries need to design national health adaptation strategies implement programmes to mitigate the health eﬀects of climate change and strengthen institutional capacities to address the health effects of climate change,media
i set out to study whether ghana s health system and health workers are prepared for the potential health risks linked to climate change,media
these risks include possible outbreaks of communicable diseases like meningococcal meningitis and cholera,media
the research the research focused on two districts located in different ecological zones,media
the areas located in the southern and northern zones were chosen to account for different perspectives,media
the focus of the research was on the capacity and preparedness towards climate related health emergencies as it relates to climate sensitive infectious diseases,media
capacity and preparedness were assessed in two ways,media
first i looked at whether programmes had been strengthened for professional health personnel to equip them to address potential climate related health risks,media
this could include human resource skill building and education,media
i also assessed the ability of health services to respond to potential emergencies from climate sensitive infectious diseases emergency preparedness and management,media
in depth interviews and surveys were carried out among health professionals within public health facilities located in the two districts,media
potential climate change health emergency risks that relate to climate sensitive infectious diseases within the ghanaian context were assessed in both districts,media
the questions related only to known health risks and diseases,media
the study showed that there were no capacity strengthening programmes for health workers to equip them to address potential climate related health risks,media
over 80 of respondents from both study districts reported not receiving training or workshops targeted towards climate change and health,media
as a result 65 of respondents in each district reported not having enough information to respond to climate related public health threats,media
respondents gave contrasting views on the issue of emergency preparedness and management,media
some said they were prepared to address potential climate health risks and emergencies,media
others said they weren t,media
respondents who indicated unpreparedness bemoaned the challenges they faced in delivering even basic health services,media
they concluded that they were not ready to deal with the impact of climate change on local populations health,media
on the other hand some respondents specified having the needed support the necessary human resources and strategies in place to help address the health threats from climate change,media
the study also showed that the position of a health facility on the hierarchical structure affected its capacity and preparedness levels,media
health workers interviewed within the higher level of health delivery district hospitals acknowledged some level of preparedness to deal with climate health emergencies compared to those at the lower level health centres,media
both levels nevertheless declared they might have challenges in addressing climate change health emergencies,media
overall the study ﬁndings indicate that health systems capacity and preparedness levels towards climate change health risks didn t diﬀer across the study contexts,media
way forward our study also shed light on the urgent need for reforms to combat the looming health impact of climate change,media
the findings call for vital measures to be put in place in terms of health systems adaptation planning and resilience building,media
it became apparent that knowledge skill building provision of logistics and infrastructure urgently need attention,media
there is also a need to provide more resources especially at the local levels,media
in addition health professionals require in service training programmes on climate change and health needs,media
training and education are key to improving preparedness and capacity,media

com climate change is making it harder for people to get the care they need 240557 link copied share article the world is witnessing the consequences of climate change long lasting changes in temperature and rainfall and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves hurricanes typhoons flooding and drought,media
all make it harder for families and communities to meet their care needs,media
climate change affects care systems in various ways,media
first sudden illnesses and unexpected disabilities heighten the need for care,media
second it reduces access to important inputs for care such as water food and safe shelter,media
third it can damage physical and social care infrastructures,media
it can also lead to breakdowns of traditional units of caregiving such as households and communities,media
and it creates new situations of need with the increase in displaced person settlements and refugee camps,media
climate change creates sudden spikes in the demand for care and serious challenges to meeting the growing need for care,media
all this has immediate and long lasting effects on human well being,media
the size of the current unmet care needs throughout the world is substantial,media
in childcare alone about 23 of children worldwide nearly 350 million need childcare but do not have it,media
families in low and lower middle income countries are the most in need,media
similarly as the world s population ages rapidly only a small proportion of the elderly who need assistance are able to use formal care in an institution or paid homecare,media
most are cared for by family members or other unpaid caregivers,media
much of this unpaid care and formal care work is provided by women and girls,media
hundreds of millions of people around the world struggle to get healthcare,media
expansion of access to essential health services has slowed compared to pre 2015,media
and healthcare costs still create financial hardship,media
without comprehensive public and global support for care provision and the integration of care in the climate agenda unmet care needs will only grow and inequalities will widen,media
impact climate change interacts with human health in complex ways,media
its impact is highly uneven across populations,media
it depends on geographical region income education gender roles social norms level of development and the institutional capacity and accessibility of health systems,media
in 2018 22 africa experienced the biggest increase in the heat related mortality rate since 2000 05,media
this is not surprising as the continent has more frequent health threatening temperatures than ever before and a growing population of people older than 65,media
africa is also the region most affected by droughts in 2013 22 with 64 of its land area affected by at least one month of extreme drought per year on average,media
it was followed by oceania 55 of its land area and south and central america 53,media
scientific evidence also points to increases in health inequalities caused by climate change,media
the health effects of climate change are not uniformly felt by different population groups,media
exposure severity of impact and ability of individuals to recover depend on a variety of factors,media
physiological characteristics income education type of occupation location social norms and health systems are some of them,media
for example older people and young children face the greatest health risks from high temperatures,media
there is also evidence of the disproportionate effect of climate change on the health of people living in poverty and those who belong to disadvantaged groups,media
women of lower social and economic status and with less education are more vulnerable to heat stress compared to women in wealthier households and with higher education or social status,media
they are exposed to pollution in the absence of clean cooking fuel and to extreme heat as they walk to gather water and fuel or do other work outdoors,media
bad sanitation in poor urban areas increases the incidence of water borne diseases after heavy rains and floods,media
lack of access to healthcare services and the means to pay for medicines make it difficult for women and men in low income households to recover from illness heat strokes and air pollution related ailments,media
mental health problems are being attributed to climate change as well,media
studies show that the loss of family or kin member home livelihood and a safe environment can bring about direct emotional impacts,media
these adverse impacts increase the demand for caregiving and the care workload,media
climate induced health problems force family and community caregivers particularly women to spend more time looking after the sick and disabled particularly frail elderly people and children,media
effect on food and water climate change threatens the availability of food clean water and safe shelter,media
it erodes households and communities care capacity and hence societies ability to thrive,media
fluctuations in food supply and rising food prices as a result of environmental disasters along with the inadequacy of government policies underscore the mounting challenge of meeting food needs,media
the threat of chronic shortage of safe drinking water has also risen,media
water scarcity is an area where structural inequalities and gender disparities are laid bare,media
care for the sick and disabled the young and the elderly is compromised when water is scarce,media
effects on providing care extreme weather events disrupt physical care infrastructures,media
it may be hard to reach hospitals clinics daycare centres nursery schools and nursing homes,media
some facilities may be damaged and have to close,media
another type of care system that can break down is family networks and support provided by friends and neighbours,media
these informal care sharing arrangements are illustrated in a study of the three large informal settlements in nairobi,media
about half 50,media
5 of the sampled households reported having had a sick member in the two weeks before the survey,media
the majority relied on close friends and family members living nearby for care and support,media
studies have shown that climate change eventually leads to livelihood loss and resource scarcity which can weaken social cohesion and local safety nets in affected communities,media
heightened risks and uncertainty and imminent changes in socio economic and political conditions can also compel individuals or entire households to migrate,media
migration is caused by a host of factors but it has increasingly been a climate related response,media
the world bank s groundswell report released in 2018 for example projected that climate change could force 216 million people to move within their countries by 2050 to avoid the slow onset impacts of climate change,media
a possible consequence of migration is the withdrawal of care support provided by the migrating extended kin neighbours or friends increasing the caregiving load of people left behind,media
in the case of forced displacements the traditional social networks existing in communities are disrupted entirely,media
what s needed there are compelling reasons to believe that meeting care needs can also help mitigate the effects of climate change,media
and actions to meet carbon zero goals prevent biodiversity loss and regenerate ecosystems can reduce the care work burden that falls heavily on families communities and women,media
any effort to tackle these grave problems should be comprehensive in scope and must be based on principles of equality universality and responsibility shared by all,media

while everyone will be affected these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities depending on underlying economic geographic social and health status,media
recently there s been increasing attention on climate change and health including calls from australian scientists led by professor peter doherty for the government to put climate change on the g20 agenda,media
my research focuses on social inequality and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices,media
i presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent australian academy of science symposium on climate and health,media
inequities of man made natural disasters low lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones,media
these storms can generate storm surges causing flooding direct injury and damage to infrastructure including housing water and sanitation systems,media
poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures less safe locations and building sites and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage,media
at the end of 2013 the philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon haiyan which affected 16 million people,media
6 069 people were reported dead while 4,media
1 million people were displaced with 1,media
1 million houses damaged or destroyed,media
while everyone was touched by the typhoon large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low lying regions,media
poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate related disasters or to rebuild,media
the ﬂooding of new orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities,media
elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport,media
we see similar issues with heatwaves,media
lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat,media
this increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths,media
poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods,media
impacts on agriculture our agricultural systems are also under threat,media
increasing drought periods in australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions and hence those communities that depend on primary production,media
this will affect people s income stress levels and sense of hope,media
in 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern victoria destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle,media
but the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community typical of other rural australian communities,media
economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship led to closures in local businesses and young people moving away,media
this has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities,media
these factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts,media
climate change also exacerbates food insecurity,media
modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33 increase in the price of vegetables and a 43 increase in fruit prices in australia because of the drought and extreme weather events,media
rising food prices most affect the poor as a proportion of total household expenditure food makes up an average of around 19,media
but with 12 of australians living below the poverty line these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many australians face,media
climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce fish lean meat and so on and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories,media
cheap calories are found in the most highly processed long shelf life products containing hardened fats and bulk starches preserved with sugar or salt,media
where does inequality come from,media
climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards resource use levels of exposure to environmental stresses and existing health inequities,media
australians who are more socially disadvantaged by income employment status education and indigenous australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression diabetes heart disease and cancers,media
parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment low levels of education and poor and dangerous housing conditions leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes,media
the health experience of people living in rural and remote australia is often worse than the urban average,media
climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people,media
in creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever increasing volumes of production and consumption the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems,media
the best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality,media
this might include fairer and more sustainable food systems affordable quality housing pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas,media
this will not only improve health but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment,media

gains from net zero are often presented as global benefits and mainly for future generations,media
but less fossil fuel use also means less air pollution which results in local health gains right away,media
for example rapid health gains are predicted from policies for us net zero by 2050,media
by 2035 between 4 000 to 15 000 fewer us residents would die annually from air pollution saving the us economy 65bn to 128bn with even greater benefits thereafter,media
a study led by imperial college london has found that there are large health gains from uk net zero actions,media
dr mike holland who was part of the study team said fundamental changes required for net zero will bring long lasting benefits to uk health,media
or turn that around,media
if we don t take the net zero path we will be sicker,media
this would be a double own goal on both climate and health,media
the researchers looked at the net zero pathways for transport and buildings in the uk s sixth carbon budget,media
health improvements came about from less air pollution and also increased exercise from more walking cycling and e biking,media
by 2060 the economic gains from fewer deaths would amount to 26bn 31bn,media
new evidence meant they were also able to estimate gains from less illness too around 20bn adding to the economic benefits from net zero,media
some gains would be expected straight away as air pollution decreased,media
these include fewer new cases of asthma in children and adults as well as reduced hospital admissions for breathing and heart problems,media
this is consistent with recent health improvements that followed bradford s clean air zone and others around europe,media
fewer strokes and heart attacks would emerge more slowly over five years as air pollution started to reduce,media
for lung cancer the reduction in cases would be expected to lag air pollution improvements by six to 20 years,media
but the gains would not stop in 2060,media
children born in the 2050s would suffer from fewer air pollution illnesses as they grew up and aged as adults,media
although less certain than the other illnesses studied the greatest long term gains could be in cases of dementia,media
skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion walking cycling and e biking as part of net zero would also lead to health gains,media
prof christian brand part of the study team said if transport decarbonisation focuses mainly on commuting how much health improvement and emissions reduction are we leaving on the table,media
without policies that support all forms of mobility especially the short everyday trips that reduce car dependency are we missing a crucial opportunity to maximize the full benefits of net zero,media
participation is key to maximising these gains across society especially amongwomen and older people,media
the study found that people walking or cycling for transport could expect to an average of five and half months longer life expectancy and a healthier life,media

a world that was 6c warmer than it is today would be devastating,media
and remember 6c is just the average,media
some parts of the world would get much warmer especially the poles,media
crops would fail,media
many people would be malnourished,media
forests would be stripped back into savannahs,media
island nations would be completely submerged,media
many cities will have disappeared due to sea level rise,media
climate refugees will be on the move,media
normal temperatures in many parts of the world would be unbearable,media
even the richest most temperate nations would see devastating floods most winters and baking summers,media
we would be at very high risk of setting off warming feedback loops the melted ice would reflect less sunlight the melted permafrost might unlock methane from the bottom of the ocean and dying forests wouldn t be able to regrow to suck carbon out of the atmosphere,media
a 6c warmer world might be short lived it could quickly spiral into 8c 10c or more,media
it would be a massive humanitarian disaster,media
only a few years ago i thought this was where we were headed,media
5c or 2c we were destined for 4c 5c or 6c and there was nothing we could do about it,media
most people still think that this is the path we re following,media
thankfully it s not,media
in 2015 i went to paris for the big famous climate conference cop21,media
representatives and policymakers from every country came together to hash out a new climate deal,media
the previous goal of the international agreement was to keep the global average temperature rise below 2c by the end of the century,media
so i couldn t believe it when there were rumours that a target of 1,media
5c was being discussed,media
were they crazy,media
at that point i had already given up on the prospects of 2c,media
it was so far out of our reach,media
the notion that we could keep the rise below 1,media
5c seemed delusional,media
and yet the target made it into the final agreement,media
mostly as an aspiration but it was in there nonetheless,media
the world pledged to limit global warming to well below 2c above pre industrial levels and also if possible pursue efforts to cap warming at 1,media
my perspective on 1,media
5c hasn t shifted much since then,media
without a major unexpected technological breakthrough we will go past this target,media
nearly all the climate scientists i know agree they obviously want to cap warming at 1,media
5c but very few think it will happen,media
this doesn t stop them fighting for it though they know that every 0,media
1c matters and is worth working for,media
but my perspective on 2c has changed,media
i m now cautiously optimistic that we can get close to it,media
it s more likely than not that we will pass 2c but perhaps not by much,media
and there is still a reasonable chance if we really step up to the challenge that we can stay below it,media
my perspective flipped quickly after studying the data not newspaper headlines,media
i didn t focus on where we are today but on the pace that things have moved at in the past few years and what this means for the future,media
one organisation the climate action tracker follows every country s climate policies and its pledges and targets,media
it combines them all to map out what will happen to the global climate,media
at our world in data i sketch out these future climate trajectories and update them every year,media
every time they get closer and closer to the pathways we would need to follow to stay below 2c,media
if we stick with the climate policies that countries currently have in place we re heading towards a world of 2,media
5c to 2,media
let me be clear this is terrible and we have to avoid it,media
but countries have pledged to go much further,media
they ve committed to making their policies much more ambitious,media
if each country was to follow through on their climate pledges we d come out at 2,media
1c by 2100,media
what s most promising is how these pathways have shifted over time,media
in a world without climate policies we d be heading towards 4c or 5c at least,media
this is the path that most people still think we re on,media
that would be a scary world indeed,media
thankfully over time countries have stepped up their commitments,media
as we saw with the example of the ozone layer incremental increases in ambition can make a huge difference,media

photograph murdo macleod the observer the other big change is that moving to a low carbon sustainable economy is not seen as the sacrifice it used to be,media
fossil fuels were far cheaper than renewables,media
electric vehicles cost a fortune,media
but now low carbon technologies are becoming cost competitive,media
it now makes financial sense to take the climate friendly path,media
leaders have become more optimistic about how the landscape is changing,media
we are still some distance from a 2c pathway,media
we need to step up our efforts and quickly,media
but as it becomes more and more realistic i m confident we can keep moving closer to it,media
w hen i was in my early teens i thought most of us were going to die from climate change,media
i tried to convince my classmates of this too,media
for my english oral exam i held up a map of all of the cities and coastlines that were going to sink by the end of the century,media
i showed projected satellite images of the wildfires that would ravage the globe,media
in trying to light flames of interest i simply added fire to my own anxieties,media
by the time i reached edinburgh university i was being flooded with images every day,media
some from my university lectures which given the fact i d chosen a degree in earth sciences was expected,media
but more importantly my obsession for environmental sciences was growing in tandem with the uptick in the frequency of reporting,media
the more determined i became to stay informed the quicker the stories came at me often accompanied by streams of recorded videos,media
i didn t have to imagine the pain of the victims i could see and hear it too,media
as a responsible citizen i wanted to stay informed,media
i had to know what the latest disaster was,media
to switch off from them seemed like a betrayal to the lives that were lost,media
with reports of disasters coming at me faster every day it seemed that things must be getting worse,media
climate change was driving an intensification of disasters and more people were dying than ever before,media
or so i thought,media
the problem was that i mistook the increase in the frequency of reporting as an increase in the frequency of disasters,media
i mistook an increase in the intensity of my secondhand suffering for an increase in the intensity of global suffering,media
in reality i had no idea what was happening,media
were disasters getting worse,media
were there more this year than last,media
were there more people dying than ever before,media
then i discovered the work of swedish physician statistician and public speaker hans rosling,media
videos of his lectures taught me that extreme poverty and child mortality were falling and education and life expectancy were rising,media
i went looking for other areas where my preconceptions might be wrong,media
i started with data on natural disasters,media
i would have bet a lot of money that more people were dying from disasters today than a century ago,media
i was completely wrong,media
death rates from disasters have actually fallen since the first half of the 20th century,media
and not just by a little bit,media
they have fallen roughly tenfold,media
it s at this point that i should make one thing clear none of the above means that climate change is not happening,media
the decline in deaths from disasters does not mean that disasters are getting weaker or less common,media
deniers often misuse this data to downplay the existence or risks of climate change,media
but that s not what the data shows us at all,media
in the past it was common for disasters to claim millions of lives a year,media
the 1920s 30s and 40s were particularly bad,media
there were a few large earthquakes that claimed many lives china japan pakistan turkey and italy were all hit by a series of earthquakes that cost tens of thousands of lives,media
the most lethal the 1920 earthquake that struck the gansu province in china is estimated to have killed 180 000 people,media
but it was drought and floods that were the most deadly,media
china endured a number of large floods and droughts through the 1920s and 30s which often led to widespread famine and killed millions at a time,media
today the annual death toll is much smaller usually between 10 000 and 20 000,media
sometimes there are particularly devastating years where the toll is much higher like 2010 when the annual death toll was more than 300 000 with most deaths resulting from the haitian earthquake,media
when i zoomed out and saw these trends i felt stupid,media
i also felt cheated,media
i had been duped by an education system that was supposed to teach me about the world,media
i was a diligent student,media
i won medals for coming top for everything from earth materials to sedimentology atmospheric science to oceanography,media
i could create complex diagrams of seismic faults i could recite the chemical formulas of pages of minerals from memory but if you d asked me to draw a graph of what was happening to deaths from disasters i d have sketched it upside down,media
i wasn t alone in my ignorance,media
in the 2017 gapminder misconception study the public across 14 countries were asked 12 key questions one of which was how did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the past 100 years,media
a more than doubled b remained more or less the same c decreased to less than half just 10 got the right answer c,media
the most popular answer 48 of the vote was a,media
t o tackle climate change we have to accept two things climate change is happening and human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible,media
we simply don t have time to argue about the existence of climate change,media
by we i mean all of us collectively,media
the time for debating is over,media
we need to move past it to the question of what we re going to do about it,media
let s take a close look at where we are with carbon emissions,media
they are still rising but the world has already passed the peak of per capita emissions,media
it happened a decade ago,media
most people are unaware of this,media
in 2012 the world topped out at 4,media
9 tonnes per person,media
since then per capita emissions have been slowly falling,media
nowhere near fast enough but falling nonetheless,media
this is a signal that the peak in our total not per capita co 2 emissions is coming,media
this is the case with any metric in a world with an increasing population,media
per capita measures will peak first then it s a tug of war over whether our impacts per person will fall more quickly than the population is growing,media
we are very close,media
emissions increased rapidly in the 1960s and 70s then again in the 1990s and early 2000s,media
but in recent years this growth has slowed down a lot,media
emissions barely increased at all from 2018 to 2019,media
and they actually fell in 2020 as a result of the covid 19 pandemic,media
i m optimistic we can peak global emissions in the 2020s,media
one of the simple things that brings me the most joy in life is getting an email from my grandma,media
my gran is in her mid 80s and can almost work an ipad,media
by work i mean do the basics of looking at a photograph and sending an email,media
she doesn t have an iphone a laptop or a smartwatch,media
my grandpa rejects all modern technology except television,media
their life is very similar to how it was a few decades ago,media
this has created something of a divide between the generations on climate change,media
many see the lifestyles of youngsters as the problem,media
we spend all day on energy guzzling gadgets,media
we flock to dense cities with no gardens or green space,media
we buy lots of stuff and don t bother to repair it,media
we never ration food and waste too much of it,media

photograph thomas mukoya yet my carbon footprint is less than half that of my grandparents when they were my age,media
when my grandparents were in their 20s the average person in the uk emitted 11 tonnes of co 2 per year,media
we now emit less than five tonnes,media
the gap between me and my parents is equally wide,media
from the 1950s to the 90s emissions in the uk changed very little,media
it s only since then in my lifetime that emissions have plummeted,media
technology has made that possible,media
in 1900 nearly all of the uk s energy came from coal and by 1950 it was still supplying more than 90,media
now coal supplies less than 2 of our electricity and the government has pledged to phase it out completely by 2025,media
coal is now almost dead in its birthplace where it all began,media
it has been replaced with other sources of energy gas then nuclear and now a transition to wind solar and other renewable sources,media
that means that for every unit of energy we consume we emit much less co 2,media
but that s not the only change,media
we also use much less energy overall,media
per capita energy use has fallen by around 25 since the 1960s,media
year after year more efficient gadgets have come into our lives,media
first it was improvements in the energy ratings of white goods then it was the trend of replacing inefficient lightbulbs,media
then it was double glazed windows and home insulation to stop heat leaking out into the street,media
when i was a kid our family television we only had one was a massive box that seemed to be two metres deep,media
the screen was so small you had to sit really close to see anything,media
our car was a gas guzzler,media
not a gas guzzler like we see with suvs today,media
my parents would never have bought one of those,media
no our car was secondhand and it was a banger,media
it was inefficient you could hear the engine roar and feel it overheating,media
the miles per gallon were terrible,media
these massive strides in technology mean that we use much less energy than we did in the past despite appearing to lead much more extravagant energy intensive lifestyles,media
the notion that we need to be frugal to live a low carbon life is simply wrong,media
in the uk we now emit about the same as someone in the 1850s,media
i emit the same as my great great great grandparents,media
and i have a much much higher standard of living,media
yet very few people know that emissions are falling,media
the climate scientist jonathan foley recently polled his followers on twitter,media
he asked what had happened to emissions in the us over the past 15 years,media
had they a increased by more than 20 b increased by 10 c stayed the same d fallen by 20 thousands of people answered,media
two thirds of people picked a or b,media
just 19 picked the correct answer d,media
no wonder people think we re screwed,media
we have a habit of underestimating how quickly things can change,media
most of us have been too pessimistic about renewable energy in the past even the experts,media
part of the reason i thought that 2c was so far out of reach was that i couldn t see how low carbon energy could grow quickly enough,media
in just a decade between 2009 and 2019 solar photovoltaic and wind energy went from the most to the least expensive source,media
the price of electricity from solar has declined by 89 and the price of onshore wind has declined by 70,media
they are now cheaper than coal,media
leaders no longer have to make the difficult choice between climate action and providing energy for their people,media
the low carbon choice has suddenly become the economic one,media
it s staggering how quickly this change has happened,media
poorer countries do not have to follow the fossil fuel heavy and unsustainable trajectories that rich countries did,media
they can leapfrog the centuries long journey that we ve taken,media
and they don t have to sacrifice human wellbeing or access to energy,media
in fact by adopting these technologies they can ensure that even more people have access to affordable energy,media
the huge progress being made in developing affordable low carbon alternatives to fossil fuels is just one counter to the doomsday thinking of so much of the climate change conversation,media
it has become too common to tell kids that they re going to die from climate change,media
if a heatwave doesn t get them then a wildfire will,media
or a hurricane a flood or mass starvation,media
there is an intense feeling of anxiety and dread among young people about what the planet has in store for us,media
in my book i look at realistic ways we can adapt the fields of energy transport food and construction to rein in climate change while improving human wellbeing at the same time,media
if we take several steps back we can see something truly radical gamechanging and life giving humanity is in a truly unique position to build a sustainable world,media
another reason some climate scientists are less pessimistic is that they believe that things can change,media
the past few decades have been an uphill battle for them,media
they ve been mostly ignored,media
often they were the ones framed as apocalyptic scaremongers,media
but finally the world has woken up to the reality of climate change and people are taking action,media
the climate scientists know change is possible because they ve seen it happen,media
against the odds they ve driven much of it,media

5 billion years from their lives air pollution causes people in northern china to live an average of 5,media
5 years shorter than their southern counterparts according to a study released on monday which claims to show in unprecedented detail the link between air pollution and life expectancy,media
high levels of air pollution in northern china much of it caused by an over reliance on burning coal for heat will cause 500 million people to lose an aggregate 2,media
5 billion years from their lives the authors predict in the study published in the journal the proceedings of the national academy of sciences,media
the geographic disparity can be traced back to china s huai river policy which since it was implemented between 1950 and 1980 has granted free wintertime heating to people living north of the huai river a widely acknowledged dividing line between northern and southern china,media
much of that heating comes from the combustion of coal significantly impacting the region s air quality,media
using data covering an unusually long timespan from 1981 through 2000 the researchers found that air pollution was about 55 higher north of the river than south of it the mit energy initiative said in a statement,media
linking the chinese pollution data to mortality statistics from 1991 to 2000 the researchers found a sharp difference in mortality rates on either side of the border formed by the huai river,media
they also found the variation to be attributable to cardiorespiratory illness and not to other causes of death,media
the researchers based in israel beijing and the massachusetts institute of technology gauged the region s air quality according to the established metric of total suspended particulates tsp representing the concentration of certain airborne particles per cubic meter of air,media
the study concluded that long term exposure to air containing 100 micrograms of tsp per cubic meter is associated with a reduction in life expectancy at birth of about 3,media
air pollution has been the subject of widespread public outrage in china since january when beijing s air quality index aqi a similar metric to tsp regularly exceeded 500 the scale s maximum reading for weeks on end,media
on 12 january beijing s aqi hit a record 755 30 times higher than levels deemed safe by the world health organisation,media
past studies have established a link between air pollution and reduced life expectancy,media
one recent large scale study concluded that air pollution contributed to 1,media
2 million premature deaths in china in 2010,media
yet according to michael greenstone an economics professor at mit and one of the study s authors this study is the first to precisely quantify their relationship,media
demonstrating that people die a bit earlier is interesting and helps establish that pollution is bad he said,media
but the most important question the next question that needed to be answered is what s the loss of life expectancy,media
how much should society be willing to pay to avoid high levels of pollution,media
this study was structured so we could answer that question,media
china s central authorities are keenly aware that environmental degradation has become one of the country s leading causes of social unrest,media
last month china s cabinet revealed 10 new measures intended to combat air pollution and state media reported that chinese courts can now impose the death penalty on serious polluters,media

cold kills more people than heat in europe and some have argued that climate change will benefit society by reducing those deaths,media
but the study published in the lancet public health found that the death toll would respond slowly to warming weather and may even rise through people growing older and more vulnerable to dangerous temperatures,media
if global heating reaches a catastrophic 3c or 4c the researchers concluded the rise in heat deaths will greatly outstrip the fall in cold deaths,media
the researchers said the results suggested climate change could pose unprecedented challenges to public health systems particularly during heatwaves,media
many more heat related deaths are expected to occur as the climate warms and populations age while deaths from cold decline only slightly said david garcía león from the joint research centre at the european commission a co author of the study,media
deaths from warm weather could kill 129 000 people a year if temperatures rise to 3c above preindustrial levels,media
today heat related deaths in europe stand at 44 000,media
but the yearly death toll from cold and heat in europe may rise from 407 000 people today to 450 000 in 2100 even if world leaders meet their global warming target of 1,media

warming climate is turning rivers rusty with toxic metals read more the research comes on the back of a series of scorching heatwaves that have wreaked havoc across the continent,media
its results challenge arguments from climate deniers that global heating is good for society because fewer people will die from cold,media
even in europe the coolest inhabited continent the lives lost to stronger heat will offset those saved by milder cold the study found,media
countries across asia africa oceania and the americas are baking in even deadlier temperatures,media
this research is a stark reminder of the number of lives that we are putting at risk if we fail to act quickly enough against climate change said madeleine thomson the head of climate impacts and adaptation at the health research charity wellcome who was not involved in the study,media
the predicted tripling of direct heat deaths in europe was not even the full picture she added pointing to research that links extreme heat to miscarriages and worse mental health,media
and then there are the indirect impacts,media
we have already seen how extreme heat events can cause crop failure wildfire devastation damage critical infrastructure and hit the economy all of which will have knock on effects on our lives,media
the researchers modelled data on 854 cities to estimate deaths from hot and cold temperatures across the continent,media
they found that heat would kill more people in all parts of europe but that the heaviest burden would fall on southern european countries such as spain italy and greece as well as parts of france,media
they projected the death toll from uncomfortable temperatures would rise by 13,media
5 if the planet heats 3c a level of climate breakdown slightly higher than policies are expected to cause leading to 55 000 extra deaths,media
most of those who die will be older than 85,media
gary konstantinoudis an epidemiologist from the mrc centre for environment and health who was not involved in the research said the study was of high quality and provided valuable insights but cautioned that predicting temperature related deaths was complex and would always contain uncertainty,media
skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion the analysis was based on a previous study that assumed the effect of temperature on death rates was constant between 2000 and 2019 he said but other studies have reported a decrease because of factors such as improved healthcare and changes to infrastructure,media
not accounting for this is expected to overestimate the future impact of heat on mortality he said,media
the study also extrapolated heat mortality data from cities to rural regions which face less heat stress,media
elisa gallo an environmental epidemiologist at isglobal who has studied heat mortality in europe and who was not involved in the study said it was increasingly essential to adapt to rising heat,media
the researchers encouraged governments to consider policies to reduce death tolls such as investing in hospitals creating action plans and insulating buildings,media
they highlighted that the projected rise in deaths was driven by changes to europe s population structure and climate,media
if we want to avoid reaching the worst case scenario it is fundamental to tackle the root of the problem by addressing emissions of greenhouse gases said gallo,media
the researchers concluded that efforts to adapt should focus on regions with high unemployment poverty structural economic changes emigration and ageing populations,media
they said such areas were less able to adapt to climate damages and also hit harder by the rise in heat deaths,media

london reuters a child born today faces multiple and life long health harms from climate change growing up in a warmer world with risks of food shortages infectious diseases floods and extreme heat a major global study has found,media
climate change is already harming people s health by increasing the number of extreme weather events and exacerbating air pollution according to the study published in the lancet medical journal,media
and if nothing is done to mitigate it its impacts could burden an entire generation with disease and illness throughout their lives,media
children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate,media
their bodies and immune systems are still developing leaving them more susceptible to disease and environmental pollutants said nick watts who co led the lancet countdown on health and climate change study,media
he warned that health damage in early childhood is persistent and pervasive and carries lifelong consequences,media
without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions gains in wellbeing and life expectancy will be compromised and climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation he told a london briefing,media
yet introducing policies to limit emissions and cap global warming would see a different outcome the research teams said,media
in that scenario a child born today would see an end to coal use in britain for example by their 6th birthday and the world reaching net zero emissions by the time they were 31,media
the lancet study is a collaboration by 120 experts from 35 institutions including the world health organization the world bank university college london and china s tsinghua university,media
on a business as usual pathway with little action to limit climate change it found that amid rising temperatures and extreme weather events children would be vulnerable to malnutrition and rising food prices and the most likely to suffer from warmer waters and climates accelerating the spread of infectious diseases such as dengue fever and cholera,media
among the most immediate and long lasting health threats from climate change is air pollution the researchers said,media
they called for urgent action to reduce outdoor and indoor pollution through the introduction of cleaner fuels and vehicles and policies to encourage safe and active transport such as walking and cycling,media

attempts to secure more energy food and infrastructure leave a trail of environmental contamination and human health hazards,media
it is no secret that humans are inherently selfish creatures the warning signs of climate change have been present for decades but it is only since seeing the direct effects it has had on our safety and wellbeing that most of us have been spurred into action,media
advertisement one of the main items on the cop26 agenda is aiming for a global reduction in fossil fuel burning,media
fossil fuels are formed from the fossilised remains of dead plants and animals that humans extract and burn for their carbon containing energy content,media
they include coal crude oil and natural gas,media
burning fossil fuels has been shown to have direct adverse effects on our health,media
air pollution continues to be a serious public health concern affecting nine out of 10 individuals living in urban areas worldwide,media
exposure to air pollution is the ninth biggest risk factor for lung and heart damage,media
burning coal is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions as well as an array of toxic chemicals,media
china india and the united states are the world s main coal mining regions,media
however indonesia australia russia south africa and colombia also produce large amounts,media
coal burning not only releases carbon dioxide and methane two of the worst greenhouse gases but also sulphur dioxide nitrogen oxide and mercury all of which are harmful to human health,media
crude oil combustion also releases harmful gases such as carbon dioxide and sulphur into the atmosphere whereas burning natural gas can release the powerful greenhouse gas methane when it is heated and compressed to release energy into the air,media
the lungs are the primary organ affected by gases and chemicals released by fossil fuel burning,media
people who work in coal mines are far more likely to suffer from lung diseases like emphysema and bronchitis both conditions obstruct airways and make it difficult to breathe,media
those who live near coal stations and breathe in air that contains the harmful components that coal burning releases are also at higher risk of suffering from these conditions,media
it is time for change we must demand better from our leaders and no longer sleepwalk alongside them into climate catastrophe,media
nitrogen oxide in particular can affect the protein component in the lungs and reduce their ability to inflate and deflate as well as they should meaning airflow is reduced leaving people with chronic lung conditions that can leave them short of breath,media
inhalation of these same chemicals has also been shown to have an adverse effect on the heart muscle in some people causing it to become bigger and weaker a condition known as cardiac muscle hypertrophy,media
advertisement it stands to reason that if these harmful chemicals can affect adults in such ways children must also be at increased risk,media
studies have shown that children exposed to higher levels of carbon in the air have an increased risk of cognitive impairment and even memory issues,media
there is also evidence showing that an association between high levels of nitrogen oxide and pollution from traffic on roads can affect fertility as well as the menstrual cycle in some women and increase the risk of miscarriage during pregnancy,media
and it is not just women being affected there has been a steady decline in overall sperm count in men over the last 50 years with poor air quality thought to play a factor,media
air pollution has also been linked to lower birthweights in newborn babies as well as an increased risk of premature delivery which in itself carries a high risk of health complications for babies,media
health authorities and governments have been aware of the evidence linking adverse health outcomes to poor air quality but many have been slow to act putting profit and the drive for a growing economy over the health of their populations,media

progress report what is the ay,media
2 coronavirus subvariant,media
many of us are now used to hearing about new variants of the coronavirus,media
the delta variant has become dominant due to mutations on its spike protein that allow it to more quickly and effectively bind to human host cells making it more infectious than previous variants,media
now a new subvariant of the delta variant has been identified,media
known as ay,media
2 it was first identified in the united kingdom in july and has now spread to at least 42 countries including the united states according to the latest world health organization who weekly epidemiological update on covid 19,media
2 subvariant is known to contain two additional mutations on its spike protein which is the part of the virus that sticks out and allows it to bind to human host cells thereby infecting them,media
the mutations y145h and a222v are currently under investigation by scientists,media
the questions they will be asking are whether the mutations make this new subvariant more transmissible more dangerous and more evasive to the immune response triggered by the vaccines,media
subvariant has only been increasing at a modest rate in the uk making up approximately 6 percent of new covid cases during the week commencing october 20,media
it has officially been designated a variant under investigation by the uk health security agency,media
so far there is little evidence that we need to be overly concerned about this new subvariant it has yet to show itself as being more infectious than the original delta variant and there is nothing to suggest it will take over its parent as the dominant variant of the coronavirus,media
there is also no real evidence of it causing a severer illness or being any more evasive to the immune reaction stimulated by the vaccines,media
advertisement the advice around protecting ourselves from covid remains the same get vaccinated when offered keep indoor spaces ventilated wear a mask in crowded spaces and maintain good hand hygiene,media
good news us approves vaccines for 5 to 11 year olds on october 29 2021 the us food and drug administration fda released a statement approving the emergency use of the pfizer biontech covid 19 vaccine to include children aged five to 11 years old,media
an emergency use authorization eua is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures including vaccines during public health emergencies such as the current covid pandemic,media
the decision came after a panel reviewed the data from a study looking at the effectiveness and safety of a low dose version of the pfizer vaccine in this age group the panel came to the conclusion pdf that the benefits of getting the vaccine outweighed any potential risks,media
in the us children aged five to 11 make up 39 percent of covid cases in under 18s,media
the ongoing study conducted with approximately 3 100 children in the us finland poland and spain showed that five to 11 year olds had a similar immune response to the vaccine as those aged 16 to 25 and that the vaccine was 90,media
7 percent effective in preventing covid 19 in this younger age group,media
while no serious side effects have been detected commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain sore arm redness and swelling fatigue headache muscle and or joint pain chills fever swollen lymph nodes nausea and decreased appetite,media
more children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first,media
these were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days of the vaccination,media
most went away within one to two days,media
advertisement the pfizer vaccine has been linked to inflammation of the heart muscle and its lining in young men but the study showed no such side effect in five to 11 year olds although the study was relatively small and is ongoing,media
although covid is generally not as serious a condition in children as it is in adults there have been 440 deaths of children and teens aged five to 18 from the virus in the us since the start of the pandemic,media
this may seem like a relatively small number but it is worth pointing out that we do not see high numbers of deaths in this age group in developed countries from any infectious disease,media
in the us children aged five to 11 make up 39 percent of covid cases in those below 18,media
according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc approximately 8 300 covid 19 cases in children aged five to 11 resulted in hospitalisation,media
combined with the higher risk of infection posed by the delta variant and the danger of long covid in children the fda has concluded that vaccinating this age group is in their best interests,media
personal account should the uk be removing countries from its red list,media
on the morning of november 1 2021 the uk officially removed any remaining countries from its red list,media
this meant travellers returning from ecuador the dominican republic colombia peru panama haiti and venezuela will no longer have to quarantine in hotels,media
those arriving fully vaccinated or below 18 years of age do not need to complete a predeparture covid test a test on the eighth day after arriving or isolate for 10 days at home,media
with covid cases in the uk so high in comparison to many of our neighbouring countries we are likely to be exporting more coronavirus than we are importing but i remain concerned about our lax borders,media
advertisement i fully empathise with the hardships the travel industry has had to endure during this pandemic,media
it has been affected more than most but speaking as a doctor i remain concerned about the lack of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction rt pcr testing for people returning to the uk,media
those who return from trips abroad or visit us here provided they are fully vaccinated need only do a lateral flow test on the second day after arrival,media
this then means they have to self report the result to a government website,media
the onus is on the individual to report the correct result there are no checks in place to see if tests are actually being done or if the result being reported is indeed the true reading,media
i would like to think that most people will report their results honestly and book a rt pcr test and isolate should their lateral flow test come back positive but i know this will not be the case for everyone,media
my other concern is that the lack of routine rt pcr testing for people arriving from overseas means we have less of a handle on any new variants that might inadvertently be imported in,media
we saw what happened when the delta variant was allowed in through open borders earlier this year,media
my advice would have been to have kept the day 2 rt pcr testing in place rather than replace it with a self reported lateral flow test,media
that way we could support the travel industry while keeping a closer eye on what was coming in through our borders,media
only time will tell if the uk government s current policy is the correct one,media
advertisement reader s question what is the valneva covid vaccine,media
the valneva vaccine made by french company valneva is a proposed covid 19 vaccine that is yet to complete trials,media
the vaccine technology is more traditional in that it uses a similar technique to polio and flu vaccines relying on an inactivated whole version of the coronavirus which cannot replicate or cause disease,media
after being inactivated the virus is purified and combined with an adjuvant that helps stimulate an immune response,media
the reason why there is such interest in this vaccine is that instead of just relying on the spike protein part of the virus as the pfizer moderna and astrazeneca vaccines do this one presents the whole virus to the immune system meaning that in theory you get an immune response to the whole virus and not just part of it,media
this means that if a part of the actual coronavirus mutates in the future as we have seen with emerging variants your immune system will still recognise the unmutated parts and neutralise it,media
the hope is that vaccines using this technology will be able to provide protection for longer rather than needing to be reformulated to get ahead of new variants,media
the results from trials so far have been promising with good immune responses reported as well as no serious adverse effects,media
phase three trials are ongoing but the uk has already ordered 100 million doses and countries like australia have also expressed an interest,media
if we have a vaccine that gets us ahead of any future variants that may emerge it will indeed be a game changer,media

this historic event highlighted the growing recognition of the undeniable link between health and climate change however it is important to note that the declaration is non binding but it does reflect a realisation that collective action is necessary to address the climate impact on health,media
the health day served as a platform for health to take centre stage in climate negotiations highlighting the critical role of the health sector in driving climate resilient policies and sustainable development initiatives globally,media
image credit nigeria health watch in nigeria climate change is having an increasing influence with far reaching consequences for health and well being,media
one of the most serious consequences is the potential impact on life expectancy,media
climate and health intersection recent studies have shed light on the intricate relationship between climate change and health especially its link to life expectancy rate,media

44 year drop in life expectancy at birth while a 0,media
10 increase in the composite climate change index temperature and rainfall could result in a 0,media
5 year decrease in life expectancy,media
nigeria has made significant progress in raising life expectancy with both men and women s rates showing a consistent upward increase over time,media
according to a recent bureau of statistics report women s life expectancies increased from 56 to 57 years between 2020 and 2022 while men s went from 54 to 55,media
however experts have warned that these gains could be reversed owing climate shocks like floods droughts and heatwaves as well as the role they play in exacerbating disease outbreaks,media
image credit nigeria health watch another way climate affects life expectancy is its impact on food production,media
many agrarian communities continue to experience decreased rainfall which has led to crop failures and food shortages,media
this has resulted in malnutrition and food insecurity particularly among vulnerable populations such as people in low income settings with a disproportionate impact on women children and senior citizens,media
research conducted in lagos revealed a significant impact of climate change on food crop production and yield between 1998 and 2018 resulting in a notable decline in overall production levels,media
increased temperature also creates a conducive environment for the proliferation of disease vectors such as mosquitoes increasing the incidence of preventable vector borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever,media
similarly changes in rainfall pattern which refers to the amount of rainfall and its frequency and intensity over the years can contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid,media
communities with limited access to healthcare and sanitation bear the biggest brunt as it further widens health disparities,media
image credit nigeria health watch a call for urgent action,media
according to the world bank climate change could result in a loss of between 6 to 30 in nigeria s gdp by 2050,media
this may severely impede human development including the improvement of the life expectancy rate,media
nigeria like many other countries must prioritise the implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation to safeguard public health,media
government actors and other stakeholders may also establish early detection systems for disease outbreaks caused by climate shocks by launching climate education and disease prevention initiatives aimed at local communities,media
enhancing access to primary healthcare services even during floods and prioritising investment in the healthcare workforce s resilience can be a way to limit the climate s impact on life expectancy,media
strengthening health workers capacity is also essential to protect the population from the detrimental effects of climate shocks,media

5 years in 2050 almost 5 years higher than in 2022 the rivm said in its new public health future exploration,media
the aging population continues to put an increasing burden on healthcare,media
climate change will also have a greater impact on people s health and health differences will not decrease in the coming years,media
the rivm urged the government to be consistent with its healthcare policy and also consider how policy in other areas like education work and housing impacts people s health,media
the demand for care will continue to grow in the coming decades,media
this requires sharp choices in healthcare the rivm said,media
with more people growing old healthily the netherlands needs to make an effort to ensure that elderly people can continue to participate in society,media
this is important for vitality and health the rivm said,media
at the same time the number of elderly people with health problems like dementia is increasing rapidly as is the number of people with chronic illnesses the rivm said,media
that means an increasing demand for care that cannot always be provided due to also increasing staff shortages,media
the aging population combined with healthcare staff shortages will also put more pressure on informal carers,media
the number of people aged 75 and over who require informal care will more than double to 650 000 between 2022 and 2050 but the increase in informal carers will lag far behind,media
the rivm also noticed that young people have an increasingly unhealthy lifestyle,media
obesity will increase significantly in the coming years and increasingly start at a younger age,media
more and more young people are also struggling with their mental health,media
the health institute stressed that it is important to invest in young people s health,media
for example by limiting the number of sales outlets and advertisements for unhealthy food and by paying attention to reducing performance pressure,media
another important development is the impact of climate change on the living environment and health the rivm said,media
in the coming years more people will suffer from heat stress the risk of infectious diseases spreading is increasing there will be more skin cancer and more people will die from the heat,media
climate change can also cause more mental stress,media
to counteract these consequences a healthy design of the living environment is important,media
this can be done for example by providing more greenery in cities,media
all in all the health differences in the netherlands are not decreasing in the coming years the rivm said,media
this means that people with a worse social position live in good health on average 14 years less than groups that are better off the public health and environment institute said,media
poverty uncertain income poor housing conditions and a lack of social networks contribute to this,media
there are many public health challenges for the government to tackle in the coming years,media
the rivm recommends a steadfast clear and concrete policy pointing out that prevention is a matter of years and decades,media
the effects of measures against for example an unhealthy lifestyle will only be visible years later,media
the rivm advised the government to set clear health goals in its policy and realize that many tasks are interrelated,media
it is necessary to tackle them together with public health as the central focus the institute said,media
it is also important that in addition to new measures the health policy that is already in place such as anti smoking policy or policy that encourages exercise is continued,media

extreme heat may have a bigger impact on biological ageing than smoking and drinking alcohol research suggests,media
as climate change fuels rising temperatures worldwide a new study warns that extreme heat could be speeding up the ageing process in older adults,media
seniors exposed to prolonged periods of extreme heat showed signs of increased biological ageing according to the study published in the journal science advances this week,media
researchers from the university of southern california examined data from more than 3 600 people aged 56 and older across the united states comparing their biological markers to temperature patterns in their local environments,media
those living in areas with frequent days above 32 c classified as extreme caution or higher by the us national weather service had an accelerated biological age sometimes by more than a year,media
what is biological ageing and why does it matter,media
unlike chronological age which counts the years since birth biological age reflects the wear and tear on the body at a cellular and molecular level,media
a higher biological age than chronological age is linked to an increased risk of disease and premature death,media

heat related deaths are on the rise in europe as the effects of climate crisis take hold experts say governments across europe need to make sure their healthcare systems and infrastructures are adapting to cope with drastic climatic change,media
scientists are urging european governments to take action as climate change takes hold increasing heat related deaths across the continent,media
europe is the fastest warming continent with temperatures rising roughly twice the global average according to recently published reports from the world meteorological organisation and the eu s climate agency copernicus,media
a group of public health experts and statisticians from institutions across europe have created models to analyse how temperature extremes can change the risk of mortality based on the effects of climate change over the past two decades,media
related scientists think the way humans have evolved may be preventing us from solving climate change heat related deaths are estimated to have risen across most of europe according to the recently published lancet countdown report led by the barcelona supercomputing centre in spain,media
we re using statistical approaches to understand how temperature extremes can change the risk of mortality but this is not due only to mortality it also depends on many other factors such as underlying conditions age sex socioeconomic conditions the ability to adapt to extreme heat for example if there s access to air conditioning cooling if there are health facilities available to help prevent heat related deaths said rachel lowe the director of lancet countdown in europe,media
the report says deaths on average have increased by 17 for every 100 000 people living in the region between 2013 and 2022 compared with the previous ten year period from 2003 to 2012,media
in the last few decades we ve seen unprecedented temperatures record breaking temperatures prolonged heatwaves and this has been linked to an increase in temperature related mortality that would not have been observed if the temperatures had not been changing at the rate they have been doing over the last few decades said lowe,media
related climate change is making over 200 diseases worse and our immune systems weaker study finds climate change leading to food insecurity and mosquito borne illness according to lowe access to healthcare and being able to afford a good diet come into play along with chronic illnesses in poorer populations,media

we re seeing increases in the suitability for this mosquito in large parts of europe particularly in southern europe but spreading further north,media
rachel lowe director lancet countdown in europe elderly populations who may not have access to cooling systems who are exposed to extreme heat within the home who may not be able to take measures to protect themselves and hydrate themselves can also be a risk,media
it also depends on many other co morbidities underlying risk factors for example she added,media
while southern europe bears the greatest burden of poor health from heat stresses experts warn the problems are also creeping northward,media
for example in the case of leishmaniasis we re seeing a northward shift of the area of europe which is now suitable for the transmission of leishmaniasis said lowe,media
we re also seeing particularly in northern europe increases in the length of the transmission season suitable for ticks and in the case of mosquito borne disease particularly the mosquitoes the aedes albopictus mosquitos that can transmit dengue zika and chikungunya we re seeing increases in the suitability for this mosquito in large parts of europe particularly in southern europe but spreading further north lowe added,media

it says many countries remain major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions and are still providing net subsidies for fossil fuels despite their health harms,media
it s only a matter of time before the climate conditions become more suitable across large parts of europe and unless action is taken to improve the resilience of european societies to resist local transmission of these diseases then we could be facing a serious problem lowe said,media
