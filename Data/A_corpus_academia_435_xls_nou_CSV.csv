0;A panel data study on the effect of climate change on life expectancy;The life and health of billions of people is endangered by climate change today. Life expectancy is generally used as the best metric for assessing the population health status of a nation. Against this backdrop, this paper investigates the effect of climate change on life expectancy using the panel data model. To do so, imprimis, this paper develops a conceptual framework linking direct and indirect pathways by which climate change affects health. The direct pathways are through weather variables and natural disasters. The indirect pathways are mediated through economic systems and ecosystems. Then this paper estimates the effect of climate change on life expectancy using cross-national data from 191 countries covering the period 1940–2020 and employing the fixed-effect method. The finding of this study suggests that if the annual average temperature increases by 1°C, then the life expectancy at birth will decline by 0.44 years. Moreover, the temperature rise will further negatively impact life expectancy by interacting with the rainfall cycle. If the composite climate change index, an index of the geometric mean of temperature and rainfall, increases by 10 points, the life expectancy at birth will decline by 0.50 years. Moreover, climate change will disproportionately reduce the life expectancy of females more than the life expectancy of males. A negative relationship between a composite climate change index and life expectancy underscores the urgency of addressing climate change as a public health crisis. Mitigation efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to changing conditions are essential to minimize the health risks associated with climate change. Thus, countries should come forward with prompt initiatives to contain global temperature rise and protect the health of the population on the verge of climate change.
1;The Impact of Climate Change on Life Expectancy in the UK: Empirical Evidence from Fourier Bootstrap ARDL Procedure;This study aims to determine the impact of surface temperature change, considered a proxy for climate change in the United Kingdom, on life expectancy using annual data from 1990–2021. Government expenditure is used as a control variable. The Fourier function-based bootstrap autoregressive distributed lag model is utilized to examine the cointegration among variables. The analysis outcomes reveal a long-term relationship between life expectancy, surface temperature change, and government expenditure. Furthermore, the findings reveal that surface temperature change significantly reduces life expectancy in the long run, while there is no significant relationship between the two variables in the short term. The Toda-Yamamoto causality analysis results show a unidirectional causality relationship between surface temperature change and life expectancy. Additionally, a significant bidirectional causality relationship is found between life expectancy and government expenditure.
2;Response of Global Air Pollutant Emissions to Climate Change and Its Potential Effects on Human Life Expectancy Loss;Geographical environment and climate change are basic factors for spatial fluctuations in the global distribution of air pollutants. Against the background of global climate change, further investigation is needed on how meteorological characteristics and complex geographical environment variations can drive spatial air pollution variations. This study analyzed the response of air pollutant emissions to climate change and the potential effects of air pollutant emissions on human health by integrating the air pollutant emission simulation model (GAINS) with 3 versions and CMIP5. The mechanism by which meteorological characteristics and geographical matrices can drive air pollution based on monitoring data at the site-scale was also examined. We found the total global emission of major air pollutants increased 1.32 times during 1970–2010. Air pollutant emissions will increase 2.89% and 4.11% in China and developed countries when the scenario of only maximum technically feasible reductions is performed (V4a) during 2020–2050. However, it will decrease 19.33% and 6.78% respectively by taking the V5a climate scenario into consideration, and precipitation variation will contribute more to such change, especially in China. Locally, the air circulation mode that is dominated by local geographical matrices and meteorological characteristics jointly affect the dilution and diffusion of air pollutants. Therefore, natural conditions, such as climate changes, meteorological characteristics and topography, play an important role in spatial air pollutant emissions and fluctuations, and must be given more attention in the processes of air pollution control policy making.
3;The Effect of Air Pollution and Climate Change on Sleep.;"Research has shown that air pollution and climate change affect both the duration and quality of sleep; threatens physical and mental health especially through respiratory, cardiovascular, and nervous systems; and shortens life expectancy. This review will begin with overall information on air pollution, climate change and sleep. Then, it will proceed with the effects of these two environmental issues on sleep, in the light of previous research."
4;The COVID Pandemic and Climate Change: Multifactorial risk and vulnerability;"During the last Covid-19 pandemic, 333,188 people died in Mexico, when analyzing the behavior of the pandemic, it was found that the risk of dying when infected was related to their previous medical conditions, such as degenerative diseases; research was also carried out that linked them to their gender, age, work, and school condition. So far, no analysis has been carried out linking people who have died from Covid-19 to social marginalization or vulnerability to climate change. This research arises from the question: How is environmental vulnerability related as a factor that influenced the death of people who were infected by covid-19 in Mexico during the pandemic, in the years 2020 to 2023? In order to answer this research question, it is hypothesized that vulnerability to climate change is a factor that negatively affects the life expectancy of people who were infected by Covid-19 in Mexico. The objective is to make visible how environmental deterioration has a negative impact on people's health, as well as on the emergence of new pathogens, which increases the deaths of people infected by Covid-19. In order to demonstrate this research assumption, an analysis of variance was carried out by relating the variable of people who died during the pandemic with the conditions of municipal vulnerability to global climate change. The south-central states of the Mexican Republic of Puebla, Morelos, Guerrero, State of Mexico and Mexico City were selected. It was found that environmental vulnerability has a negative impact on the life expectancy of people who were infected, so if the municipality where the deceased person lived has a greater vulnerability to climate change, there was a greater probability of death. That is why environmental justice actions must be carried out to reduce vulnerability to CC."
5;Measuring Nurses’ Knowledge and Awareness of Climate Change and Climate-Associated Diseases: Protocol for a Systematic Review of Existing Instruments;Background: Climate change is a health emergency. Each year, it is estimated to cost more than 230 million years of life expectancy, with 4–9 million premature deaths associated with air pollution, and 9 million excess deaths due to non-optimal temperatures, representing 7% more temperature-related deaths since 2015 and 66% more since 2000. Objective: Identify and evaluate the reliability, fidelity, and validity of instruments measuring nurses’ knowledge and awareness of climate change and climate-associated diseases. Methods: A systematic literature review will retrieve and assess studies examining instruments measuring nurses’ knowledge and awareness of climate change and climate-associated diseases. Using predefined search terms for nurses, climate change, literacy and scales or tools, we will search for published articles recorded in the following electronic databases, with no language or date restrictions, from their inception until 31 October 2023: Medline Ovid SP (from 1946), PubMed (NOT Medline[sb], from 1996), Embase.com (from 1947), CINAHL Ebesco (from 1937), the Cochrane Library Wiley (from 1992), Web of Science Core Collection (from 1900), the Trip Database (from 1997), JBI OVID SP (from 1998), and the GreenFILE EBSCO. We will also hand-search relevant articles’ bibliographies and search for unpublished studies using Google Scholar, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses Global, and DART-EUrope.eu. This will be completed by exploring the gray literature in OpenGrey and the Grey Literature Report, from inception until 31 October 2023, in collaboration with a librarian. Twelve bibliographic databases will be searched for publications up to 31 October 2023. The papers selected will be assessed for their quality. Results: The electronic database searches were completed in May 2023. Retrieved articles are being screened, and the study will be completed by October 2023. After removing duplicates, our search strategy has retrieved 3449 references. Conclusions: This systematic review will provide specific knowledge about instruments to measure nurses’ knowledge, awareness, motivation, attitudes, behaviors, beliefs, skills, and competencies regarding climate change and climate-associated diseases.
6;Carbon Emissions, Health Expenditure, and Economic Effects on Life Expectancy in Malaysia;Population aging, urbanization, and life expectancy are among the main pillars of sustainable economic, social, and environmental development of the future, as outlined by the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) of the United Nations. Globally, the current population structure exhibits an increasing proportion of the elderly along with rising healthcare costs and climate change. Malaysia faces a similar experience, where 14% of its population is expected to account for the elderly by 2030. To achieve the SDGs, attention should be given to their pillars, namely life expectancy, health expenditure, economic development, and carbon emissions. Limited research that addresses these key factors has been conducted, especially in emerging economies, such as Malaysia. Therefore, this study aims to contribute to the existing literature by analyzing the long-term and short-term relationships between carbon emissions, GDP, health expenditure, and life expectancy in Malaysia. The autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bounds cointegration test was adopted to determine the long-term and short-term effects on life expectancy from 1997 to 2021. The findings indicate that cointegration existed among the variables, and carbon emissions and health expenditure had a statistically significant relationship with life expectancy in the short run. Hence, greater attention should be paid to these two factors, particularly in the short term, to ensure that Malaysia can maintain the health and well-being of the nation in line with the SDG requirements.
7;A Cross-National Study on Sustainable Smart City Indicators and Their Influence on Life Expectancy—A Cluster Analysis of EU Countries;As a consequence of climate change and its negative impacts on the environment and on human health, the topic of sustainability has become an integral part of urban policy. Smart city initiatives around the world are focusing on different aspects of sustainability in order to provide better living conditions for their residents. The aim of this study is to investigate the impact of selected smart city indicators on the average life expectancy as a variable for quality of life and well-being. Based on a Common Correlated Effects (CCE) model, Instrumental Variable Estimator with Common Factors (2SIV), and clustering regression model, EU countries were divided into three distinct clusters indicating common elements but also specificities of each group. The analysis confirmed the positive impact of GDP growth, renewable energy consumption, and the proportion of the population with a tertiary level of education on life expectancy. On the other hand, CO2 emissions and transport pollution have an adverse effect. The analysis provides valuable insights into the complex relationship between smart city variables and quality of life, and it may serve as a basis for informed and responsible decision-making by relevant urban stakeholders aimed at designing more sustainable, resilient, and healthier cities.
8;Blockchain-Orchestrated Intelligent Water Treatment Plant Profiling Framework to Enhance Human Life Expectancy;Water quality degradation has turned out to be of crucial importance due to various factors over the past decade. Pollution, climate change, and population growth are the factors that affect water quality. Contaminations such as microorganisms, heavy metals, and excessive nitrogen and phosphorous disrupt water pH levels, posing significant health risks. Despite the innovation in the Internet of Things(IoT), allowing balancing the pH by adding chlorine and fluoride after the disinfection step, several security issues(e.g., distributed denial of service, data manipulation, and session hijacking) manoeuvre the operational performance of the water treatment plants. This causes people to consume polluted water, which has many adverse effects on human health and reduces life expectancy. To address this critical concern, we propose a novel approach integrating artificial intelligence(AI) and blockchain technology into water treatment plant management. Our methodology utilizes a standard water quality dataset, which has features such as pH and total hardness, which is used for binary classification, indicating water as potable or not potable. We employ various AI classifiers such as stochastic gradient descent classifier (SGDC), decision tree (DT), Naive Bayes (NB), K nearest neighbours (KNN), and logistic regression (LR). Furthermore, an InterPlanetary File System(IPFS)-based public blockchain is integrated to resist the data manipulation attack, where the potable water sample is securely stored in the blockchain’s immutable ledger. The proposed model is evaluated using various performance metrics such as confusion matrix analysis, learning curve assessment, training accuracy, and blockchain scalability. Notably, the DT model emerges as the best-performing classifier with an accuracy of 99.41% and scalability of 35 with 120 data transactions.
9;The effect of Carbon Emissions on Life Expectancy: Evidence from Azerbaijan;Life expectancy (LEX) is an important indicator of the general health status and quality of life of a country. It is directly related to factors such as the effectiveness of a country's health policies and the level of social and economic welfare. Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions are one of the key causes of global climate change and have direct negative impacts on human health through air pollution. Many studies in the literature have revealed that high CO2 emissions have negative effects on health and reduce life expectancy. This study, probably the first of its kind in Azerbaijan, was analyzed using data for the period 1974-2022. The stationarity of the variables was tested with nonlinear unit root tests such as KSS, Sollis and Kruse and it was found that they were not stationary at the level. The existence of a cointegration relationship between the variables was determined through the A-ARDL method. Based on the results obtained from CCR and FMOLS method, a 1% increase in CO2 leads to a 0.15% decrease in LEX. In addition, the results of the FTY causality test revealed that there is unidirectional causality from CO2 to LEX.
10;Severe drought exposure in utero associates to children’s epigenetic age acceleration in a global climate change hot spot;The goal of this study is to examine the association between in utero drought exposure and epigenetic age acceleration (EAA) in a global climate change hot spot. Calculations of EAA in adults using DNA methylation have been found to accurately predict chronic disease and longevity. However, fewer studies have examined EAA in children, and drought exposure in utero has not been investigated. Additionally, studies of EAA in low-income countries with diverse populations are rare. We assess EAA using epigenetic clocks and two DNAm-based pace-of-aging measurements from whole saliva samples in 104 drought-exposed children and 109 same-sex sibling controls in northern Kenya. We find a positive association between in utero drought exposure and EAA in two epigenetic clocks (Hannum’s and GrimAge) and a negative association in the DNAm based telomere length (DNAmTL) clock. The combined impact of drought’s multiple deleterious stressors may reduce overall life expectancy through accelerated epigenetic aging.
11;The need for nonuniform risk acceptability across climate change scenarios.;Climate change risk assessment studies focus on identifying and analyzing different risks considering several climate change scenarios and on evaluating the cost-effectiveness of different adaptation measures. However, risk acceptability is often not reflected on in the context of climate change risk studies. Noting that the different climate change scenarios depict drastically contrasting images of the future in terms of population growth, economic development, and changes to life expectancy, this article uses risk acceptance criteria that are based on socioeconomic considerations to highlight the need for nonuniform risk acceptability across climate change scenarios. For this purpose, the optimum implied cost of averting a fatality derived based on the life quality index concept and the value of a quality-adjusted life year derived based on the time principle of acceptable life risk are assessed in three different climate change scenarios for Sweden. Additionally, an illustrative example that assesses the acceptable probability of failure of a steel rod under axial tension in the different climate change scenarios is presented. It is shown that risk acceptance criteria can vary considerably across the different climate change scenarios (e.g., more than 190% variation in the acceptable probability of failure for Sweden in the considered example). This article demonstrates that the ability of societies to afford risk-reducing measures may vary considerably across the different climate change scenarios. Hence, it can be concluded that (1) in the context of climate change risk assessments, risk acceptance criteria need to be developed to account for the different climate change scenarios, and (2) these criteria may vary considerably across the different climate change scenarios. Finally, relevant challenges and research needs are also provided.
12;Global Health Impact from Climate Change;The phenomenon of climate change is impacting the planet with notable effect. Polar ice is melting, ocean levels are rising, daily temperatures are increasing, forest fires are burning longer and destroying more residential areas, and urban air quality levels are deteriorating. At the same time, human health is experiencing the effects of exposure to changing climate. Research has indicated that extreme climactic conditions can shorten life expectancy and impact cardias, respiratory and mental health as well as facilitating the spread of some infectious diseases. The health related impacts of climate change merit serious attention in the patient and provider communities. Opportunities to effectuate meaningful changes are examined
13;Impacts of Climate Change on Mortality: An extrapolation of temperature effects based on time series data in France;Most contemporary mortality models rely on extrapolating trends or past events. However, population dynamics will be significantly impacted by climate change, notably the influence of temperatures on mortality. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to incorporate temperature effects on projected mortality using a multi-population mortality model. This method combines a stochastic mortality model with a climate epidemiology model, predicting mortality variations due to daily temperature fluctuations, be it excesses or insufficiencies. The significance of this approach lies in its ability to disrupt mortality projections by utilizing temperature forecasts from climate models and to assess the impact of this unaccounted risk factor in conventional mortality models. We illustrate this proposed mortality model using French data stratified by gender, focusing on past temperatures and mortality. Utilizing climate model predictions across various IPCC scenarios, we investigate gains and loss in life expectancy linked to temperatures and the additional mortality induced by extreme heatwaves, and quantify them by assessing this new risk factor in prediction intervals. Furthermore, we analyze the geographical differences across the Metropolitan France.
14;Climate change and health outcomes in Sub-Saharan African countries;This paper examines the effect of climate change on health outcomes in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Greenhouse gas emission was used as the measure of climate change, while life expectancy rate was used as the measure of health outcomes. This paper's significant contribution is how the interaction of climate change and government effectiveness index influence health outcomes in SSA. We estimated the impact of climate change on health outcomes using the panel system generalized method of moments (GMM) method. Our empirical result show that there is a negative and significant relationship between climate change and life expectancy in the short and long run. In addition, we find that if effective government policy is interacted with climate change, this mutes the negative impact of climate change on health outcomes in SSA. This implies that, with effective government policies targeted toward achieving net zero carbon emission, climate change is not expected to have a significant impact on health outcomes in SSA.
15;Climate crisis threatens gains in life expectancy, report warns;If the world follows a “business as usual pathway” in relation to the climate emergency, a child born today will face a world that is on average 4°C warmer by their 71st birthday—putting their health under threat at every stage of their lives, a global report on health and climate change has warned.1  As temperatures rise harvests will shrink, threatening food security and driving up food prices in the decades ahead, said the Lancet Countdown report. Infants and small children will be among the worst affected by malnutrition and related health problems such as stunted growth, weak immune systems, and long term developmental problems.  Nick Watts, executive director of the Lancet initiative, said, “The damage done in early childhood is persistent and pervasive, with health consequences lasting for a …
16;Mortality rate and life expectancy in Africa: the role of flood occurrence;PurposeThe purpose of this paper is to investigate the effect of flood occurrence on mortality rate and life expectancy amongst 53 African countries.Design/methodology/approachThe study utilizes panel data from the period 2000–2018 on 53 African countries and system generalized method of moments (system GMM) for the analysis.FindingsThe result indicates that flood occurrence causes the destruction of health facilities and the spread of diseases which reduces life expectancy. In addition, flood occurrence increases mortality rate amongst 53 African countries.Research limitations/implicationsPractical implicationsThe study recommends that governments amongst African countries should implement strategies being enshrined in Conference of Parties (COP, 2021) on climate change. This will help to reduce the level of climate change and flood occurrence.Originality/valuePrevious studies focussed on the adverse effect of flood occurrence without considering the issue of life expectancy amongst African countries. This study contributes to existing empirical studies by examining the effect of flood occurrence on mortality rate and life expectancy amongst African countries.Peer reviewThe peer review history for this article is available at: https://publons.com/publon/10.1108/IJSE-07-2022-0508.
17;How will climate change affect ambient air pollution and what can policy-makers do now? Lessons from India;Air pollution is a growing concern in India, and its adverse health effects are well documented. Climate change is likely to exacerbate this problem by altering weather patterns and increasing the frequency and severity of extreme events. This paper examines the potential impact of climate change on ambient air pollution in India and its implications for policy design. Our analysis reveals that pollution in India is highly sensitive to variation in weather, particularly in the densely populated Indus-Gangetic Plain. Using our estimated relationship between weather and pollution, we predict that changing weather patterns will increase average PM2.5 concentrations by 3.1 µg/m3, leading to a loss of 364 million years of life expectancy. To address this challenge, we propose an emissions fee calibrated to be highest in regions most vulnerable to persistently high levels of pollution and most sensitive to future deterioration in air quality due to climate change.
18;COVID-19, global health and climate change: Causes and convergences;Despite massive global economic growth and advances in science and medicine with spectacular aggregate and individual improvements in health and life expectancy over the past century, the world has now become severely unstable in multiple domains – biological, sociological, political, ecological, economic, and health care. These pervasive instabilities are organically interactive within a complex world system that has reached crisis status at local, global, and planetary levels. Lying at the heart of this complex crisis are long-neglected disparities in health and well-being within and between countries, the refusal to face how these and climate change have arisen, and how economic considerations have fuelled the trend towards entropy (gradual decline of the planet into disorder). The critical point we have reached, starkly highlighted by the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic pari passu with ongoing climate change and planetary degradation, reminds us of our global interconnectedness with each other and with nature. Comprehending and acknowledging the myriad, humanly constructed forces in each of these domains influencing all aspects of life, are the first steps towards effectively facing challenges to our health, our humanity (collectivity as humans) and our planet. Overcoming denial, acknowledging the magnitude and complexity of these challenges, prescient vision and dedicated action capable of fostering the cooperation for overcoming obstacles are now vital to seeking peaceful pathways towards more equitable and sustainable lives. South Africa is a microcosm of the world, with its local threats and challenges mirroring the global. Significance: Instabilities that pervade the world, highlighted by the COVID-19 pandemic, are especially significant for South Africa, where they manifest most starkly because of its apartheid legacy, its relative success economically on the African continent, and the implications of ongoing widening disparities and antagonism amongst South Africa’s diverse people. Belief in moving towards narrowing wide disparities through decolonisation and reversion to an ‘idyllic African heritage’ via a transformation that includes widespread corruption, and the ANC government’s perverse erosion of lives today and in the future through ‘state capture’, intensifies rather than ameliorates our predicament in an era when cooperation and a clear vision of current threats and future possibilities are desperately needed. In an accompanying article, potential pathways towards a better future are offered through suggested shifts in paradigms of thought and action.
19;Allocation of Healthcare Resources in National Health Systems Under Climate Change;Climate change has, among others, impacts on human health and by consequence on healthcare systems. Some impacts are direct such as extreme events, air pollution and aeroallergens, and some are indirect such as reduced food production and supply, vector-borne and water-borne infectious diseases, and social and economic disruptions. The main aim of this paper is to study the pressures of climate change on national healthcare systems. An empirical dynamic resource allocation problem is proposed to estimate how healthcare systems may be affected by climate change. The problem is formulated as a nonlinear programming model which finds the optimal allocation of healthcare resources that compensate for life expectancy reductions due to climate change. We examine various scenarios of climate impacts to estimate the additional budget and healthcare resources needed. The results show that the necessary healthcare budget grows nonlinearly with respect to impacts with disproportional demands on lower income countries. Finally, the necessary healthcare investments should be made sooner as climate impacts become heavier. Our methodology could aid policy-makers in prioritizing measures to enhance the climate resilience of national healthcare systems.
20;Clinical public health, climate change, and aging;The United Nations report also highlights that life expectancy at birth is rising and is projected to continue rising, predicting that by 2050 the global mean lifespan will be about 77 years.3 In the past few decades, population aging has become widespread, whereas historically it was localized to a few geographic areas, such as Japan and Europe.2 Today, aging populations in East and Southeast Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, Australia and New Zealand, and Europe and North America are driving the phenomenon of global population aging.3 Of course, aging is a normal physiologic process. There are numerous changes that occur as people age, including changes to body fat distribution and thermoregulatory mechanisms, as well as a general slowing of metabolism. As we age, we also experience the combined effects of various insults to our health over our lifespan, which for some result in disease or illness. Noncommunicable diseases are common in the elderly population, representing globally approximately 426 million disability-adjusted life-years lost among those older than 70 in 2019.4 Not surprisingly, in highincome countries, polypharmacy also increases as humans age,5 further increasing the risk of adverse health effects. In addition, as people age, their social capital might decrease as they leave the work force, and they might lose family members and peers or increase their dependence on others.
21;Exploring the impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on Algeria’s energy used and climate change based on Olduvai theory;The Death of Industrial Civilization explains how the contemporary ecological crisis within industrial society is caused by the values inherent in unlimited economic growth and competitive materialism. It demonstrates the central role and importance of electricity, and what policy makers need to do in order to ensure that current and future systems remain reliable even as they are transformed by the rise of clean energy technologies. The novel COVID19 pandemic has created an unprecedented global health and economic crisis. The result of such a scenario is that energy demand contracts by 6%, the largest in 70 years in percentage terms and the largest ever in absolute terms. The impact of Covid19 on energy demand in 2020 would be more than seven times larger than the impact of the 2008 financial crisis on global energy demand and this is what the Olduvai theory is defined by e=energy production/population. It states that the life expectancy of Industrial Civilization is less than or equal to 100 years.
22;The Intergenerational Consequences of Climate Change on Later Life Mortality: Evidence from Individual-Level U.S. Death Records;Global climate change can impact populations rapidly through the increased occurrence of natural disasters and climate extremes, but also through long-term, gradual changes that alter environmental conditions and impair biological processes. Here, I investigate whether ambient temperatures in utero and during the early years of life are associated with reductions in life expectancy. I combine monthly, state-level climatological data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration with high-resolution, individual-level mortality data from the CenSoc Project, which consists of cleaned and harmonized Social Security Administration death records from 1988-2005. Results indicate that exposure to higher ambient temperatures during gestation and the first four years of life are associated with increased mortality risk in later life for white men from low socioeconomic status backgrounds, but not other groups. It is likely that the effect of climate variability on later life mortality for non-white men is overshadowed by structural systems of racism that impact health stratification. Overall, the results emphasize how climate change has already begun to imprint itself onto demographic processes.
23;Effect of particulate matter (PM2.5 and PM10) on health indicators: climate change scenarios in a Brazilian metropolis;Recife is recognized as the 16th most vulnerable city to climate change in the world. In addition, the city has levels of air pollutants above the new limits proposed by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2021. In this sense, the present study had two main objectives: (1) To evaluate the health (and economic) benefits related to the reduction in mean annual concentrations of PM_10 and PM_2.5 considering the new limits recommended by the WHO: 15 µg/m^3 (PM_10) and 5 µg/m^3 (PM_2.5) and (2) To simulate the behavior of these pollutants in scenarios with increased temperature (2 and 4 °C) using machine learning. The averages of PM_2.5 and PM_10 were above the limits recommended by the WHO. The scenario simulating the reduction in these pollutants below the new WHO limits would avoid more than 130 deaths and 84 hospital admissions for respiratory or cardiovascular problems. This represents a gain of 15.2 months in life expectancy and a cost of almost 160 million dollars. Regarding the simulated temperature increase, the most conservative (+ 2 °C) and most drastic (+ 4 °C) scenarios predict an increase of approximately 6.5 and 15%, respectively, in the concentrations of PM_2.5 and PM_10, with a progressive increase in deaths attributed to air pollution. The study shows that the increase in temperature will have impacts on air particulate matter and health outcomes. Climate change mitigation and pollution control policies must be implemented for meeting new WHO air quality standards which may have health benefits.
24;Socio-economic and public health impacts of climate change and water availability in Aral District, Kyzylorda Region, Kazakhstan;The research aimed to investigate the impacts of climate change and water availability on the socio-economic aspects and overall health of the population in Aral District of Kyzylorda Region of the Republic of Kazakhstan. The study focused on the following indicators: demographic characteristics of fertility, mortality (total, infant, maternal), natural population growth and life expectancy, population health indicators, disease incidence growth due to adverse ecology and harsh climate in 2005-2019. In addition, a sociological survey was conducted (August 31-September 10) in 15 settlements inside the study area that included 120 people. The survey aimed to collect feedback from the district residents on their general wellbeing and health status. The questionnaires and survey allowed establishing that overall the residents in the study area were satisfied with their level of income, did not associate their health condition with climate change, and did not intend to migrate elsewhere. In other words, in Aral District of Kyzylorda Region population migration occurs mainly due to the desire to obtain secondary and higher education, as well as improve housing conditions. The water supply in the study area showed no significant regression relation with climate change due to the installation of water pumps and delivery of drinking water by tank trucks. The most important finding is that – contrary to the initial hypothesis – based on the survey outcomes, the district demonstrated a stable increase in population due to births and immigration. Thus, according to this study Kazakhstan’s section of the Aral Sea Region manifests no catastrophic situation.
25;Social Impacts of Climate Change in Bolivia: A Municipal Level Analysis of the Effects of Recent Climate Change on Life Expectancy, Consumption, Poverty and Inequality;This paper analyzes the direct evidence of climate change in Bolivia during the past 60 years, and estimates how these changes have affected life expectancy and consumption levels for each of the 311 municipalities in Bolivia. Contrary to the predictions of most general circulation models, the evidence shows a consistent cooling trend of about 0.2°C per decade over all highland areas, slight and scattered evidence of warming in the lowlands, and no systematic changes in precipitation. The estimations indicate that the 1°C cooling experienced in the already cold highlands over the past five decades likely has reduced consumption possibilities by about 2-3 percent in these areas. Since the much richer population in the lowlands have benefitted slightly from recent climate change, the simulations suggest that recent climate change has contributed to an increase in inequality and poverty in Bolivia. Poor and indigenous peoples in the highlands are among the most severely affected populations. No statistically significant effect on life expectancy was found.
26;Does Gender Climate Influence Climate Change? The Multidimensionality of Gender Equality and Its Countervailing Effects on the Carbon Intensity of Well-Being;"The carbon intensity of well-being (CIWB) (a ratio measuring the amount of CO2 emitted per unit of life expectancy at birth) is an increasingly popular way to measure the ecological efficiency of nations. Although research demonstrates that economic development typically reduces this efficiency, little research has explored the extent to which social equality improves it. This study uses panel data for 70 nations between 1995 and 2013 to assess how various aspects of gender equality affect the ecological efficiency of nations. We estimate a series of Prais-Winsten regression models with panel-corrected standard errors (PCSE) to assess how increases in the percentage of women in parliament, expected years of education for women, and the percentage of women in the labor force independently affect CIWB. Our findings indicate that across all nations, increases in the percentage of women in parliament and expected years of schooling reduce CIWB; however, increases in the percentage of women in the labor force increase CIWB. Our results further show that the relationship between different dimensions of gender equality and CIWB differs between more developed and less developed nations. Finally, we find that increases in the number of women in parliament and women’s education attenuate the relationship between women’s labor force participation and CIWB. We discuss the variation in our results by reviewing relevant eco-gender literatures and feminist economics."
27;Dynamic linkage between economic growth, renewable-energy electricity consumption, CO2 emissions and life expectancy in Malawi;This paper analyses the dynamic relationship between economic growth, renewable-energy electricity consumption, CO2emissions and life expectancy for Malawi, during the period between 1980 and 2010. Unit root tests were conducted using Augmented Dickey Fuller tests, whereas Zivot & Andrews test was used to check structural breaks within the data. The Gregory-Hansen Cointegration test revealed that there was cointegration among the variables. Empirical results from the Autoregressive distributive lag-Error Correction Model showed the existence of both long-run and short-run association among the variables. Today, climate change is an inevitable reality. Malawi and other developing countries are faced with some sort of a dilemma. On the one hand, they have to achieve high economic growth which will depend on energy as one of its drivers. On the other hand, they need to ensure that they reduce usage of non-renewable fossil fuels to maintain meaningful levels of carbon emissions in order to realize better health outcomes such as life expectancy. This issue is important in this respect and according to the results obtained, it has been revealed that there is a positive relationship between carbon emissions and the economy in the short term only. Furthermore, the study findings showed that economic growth has positive and significant relationship with renewable energy electricity consumption and life expectancy in the long term.
28;Health impacts of fine particles under climate change mitigation, air quality control, and demographic change in India;Despite low per capita emissions, with over a billion population, India is pivotal for climate change mitigation globally, ranking as the third largest emitter of greenhouse gases. We linked a previously published multidimensional population projection with emission projections from an integrated assessment model to quantify the localised (i.e. state-level) health benefits from reduced ambient fine particulate matter in India under global climate change mitigation scenarios in line with the Paris Agreement targets and national scenarios for maximum feasible air quality control. We incorporated assumptions about future demographic, urbanisation and epidemiological trends and accounted for model feedbacks. Our results indicate that compared to a business-as-usual scenario, pursuit of aspirational climate change mitigation targets can avert up to 8.0 million premature deaths and add up to 0.7 years to life expectancy (LE) at birth due to cleaner air by 2050. Combining aggressive climate change mitigation efforts with maximum feasible air quality control can add 1.6 years to LE. Holding demographic change constant, we find that climate change mitigation and air quality control will contribute slightly more to increases in LE in urban areas than in rural areas and in states with lower socio-economic development.
29;The Social Effects of Climate Change on the Health Outcomes of Vulnerable Older Adult Populations in the Global Community;As life expectancy rates continue to increase and fertility rates continue to decline globally in the 21st century, the demographics of aging populations are undergoing an unprecedented change that will have significant consequences for the health outcomes of older adults-at-risk. According to demographic data in a joint report authored by five federal agencies, 8.5% of the world's population is currently age 65 and older, a figure projected to double by 2050. This chapter presents an analysis of the impact of climate change on the health outcomes of aging populations worldwide. It examines how the collaborative efforts of the federal government and the public health system can be utilized to create policies and programs that can prepare aging communities to deal effectively with the health consequences of our changing environment.
30;Effects of climate change on the valley glaciers of the Italian Alps;Abstract. The behaviour of the valley glaciers of the Italian Alps as a result of the climate changes expected for the 21st century has been investigated. From 1980 to 2017 the average length reductions of these glaciers has been 16 % and their average areal reduction around 22 %, much smaller than the overall glacier retreat of the Alps. Their mean observed shortening was about 500 m for a temperature increase of 1.4 °C. To quantify the valley glacier life expectancy, a model estimating their length variations from the air temperature variations of the EuroCordex climatological projections of six different models under RCP4.5 and RCP8.5 scenarios has been used. The ensemble mean temperatures in the Italian Alps region under these scenarios indicate increases of temperature of ~2 °C and ~4 °C from 2018 to 2100 respectively. In both scenarios, the glacier model projections show a constant retreat until the eighties, weakening towards the end of the century. As expected, it resulted more severe under the RCP8.5 (from 22 % to 48 %) than under the RCP4.5 (from 10 % to 25 %) scenario, with a mean length shortening of 35 % and 13 % respectively by 2100. The model used estimates that the majority of the valley glaciers could better resist the climate change.
31;A Quantitative Estimation of the Effects of Measures to Counter Climate Change on Well-Being: Focus on Non-Use of Air Conditioners as a Mitigation Measure in Japan;Measures to mitigate climate change are being considered all over the world. Reducing the use of air conditioners is one such measure. While it seems to be effective in mitigating climate change, it may also reduce individuals’ well-being and increase the risk of heatstroke. To compare the impact of reducing air conditioner use and the mortality risks, the indicator Loss of Happy Life Expectancy (LHpLE), which measures the reduction in the length of life that individuals can spend happily, was used. The reduction in well-being due to non-use of air conditioners was obtained by applying the propensity score matching method to the results of a questionnaire. We evaluated the impact of reducing air conditioner use in both the current and future situation in comparison to the mortality risk from flood and heatstroke, respectively. The increase in mortality risk due to flooding was estimated based on numerical simulation, and the increase in the risk of mortality due to heatstroke was estimated based on existing reports in Japan. Using these results, the magnitude of the impacts on LHpLE caused by the reduction in well-being due to the non-use of an air conditioner and the increase in the mortality risks were compared, both for the current situation and the future. The results show that LHpLE due to non-use of air conditioners was much greater than that due to the risk of mortality due to flood and heatstroke, and implied that reducing air conditioner use is not necessarily a good way as a mitigation measure. This result would be useful for creating and implementing measures to counter climate change and could also be applied in many other fields.
32;Status of the burbot (Lota lota L.) in the Lower Danube (Bulgaria) – a species threatened by climate change;Abstract The study provides data on the catch composition, length-weight relationship, age structure, gender structure, growth, maturation, fecundity, distribution and conservation status of the burbot Lota lota (Linnaeus, 1758) in Bulgaria. During six consecutive winters (2008–2014) a total of 395 burbot specimens were caught. The total length and the weight of the specimens ranged from 16 to 51 cm and 29.8 to 1057 g, respectively. Seven age classes were represented (3- to 9-years-old), with 3-, 4-, and 5-years-old most abundant. The maximal life expectancy was estimated as 12 years. Male-female ratio was 1:1. Maturity happens at the age of four at the earliest, valid for both sexes. One-quarter of the fish, older than 5 years were determined as non-reproducing in the particular year. The absolute fecundity varied between 47 462 and 810 236 eggs for females ranging from 5 to 7 years old and from 25.7 to 41.5 cm in length. A dramatic decrease of burbot population was observed in the last two decades. Warming water temperatures of the Danube, together with fragmentation in its tributaries are considered as the major threats affecting the species. Therefore, the burbot in Bulgaria is classified as Endangered.
33;Global Demographic Change and Climate Policies;Between 1950 and 2017, world average life expectancy increased from below-50 to above-70, while the fertility rate dropped from 5 to about 2.5. We develop and calibrate an analytic climate-economy model with overlapping generations to study the effect of such demographic change on capital markets and optimal climate policies. Our model replicates findings from the OLG-demography literature, such as a rise in households’ savings, and a declining rate of return to capital. We also find that demographic change raises the social cost of carbon, at 2020, from 28 euro/tCO2 in a model that abstracts from demography, to 94 euro/tCO2 in our calibrated model.
34;Discovering the differential and gendered consequences of natural disasters on the gender gap in life expectancy in Southeast Asia;Abstract. Generally, the country and the population at risk experience the consequences of natural disasters differently and disproportionately. Likewise, the negative impacts of the natural disaster on the population are not gender-neutral. This article explores the relationship of the negative consequences of natural disasters on the difference of gender gap in life expectancy in Southeast Asia. Using the regional data set over the period 1995 to 2011, we analyzed the influence of the natural disaster magnitude, i.e. number of disaster-related casualties, and the interaction with women's socioeconomic and political rights, and the country’s vulnerability and exposure to climate change impacts on the gender gap in life expectancy, i.e. ratio of female to male life expectancy. The study produced three important findings. First, Southeast Asian women's life expectancy is more likely to decrease on average compared to that of men as the magnitude of natural disaster increases. Second, lower women's socioeconomic and political conditions are associated with the gender difference in life expectancy as the magnitude of natural disaster increases. Lastly, country's higher level of exposure and vulnerability to climate change impacts are associated with the negative influence of natural disasters on the women's life expectancy more than that of men. Taken together, our study concluded that lower women's socioeconomic and political conditions, as well as country's higher climate change-related vulnerabilities, are likely to pose a collective threat to women's overall well-being more than that of men.
35;Life Expectancy at Birth : the Numbers Behind the Means;Datasets spanning long periods of time, are crucial to our understanding of a range of phenomena, both within as outside social and economic history. For various processes, from social inequality to climate change, only change gradually, requiring long periods of time to observe and to explain change. Moreover, data spanning longer periods of time help us to unravel causality issues in the processes we study. Finally, time series data help us put contemporary phenomena in perspective.
36;Tackling the health impacts of climate change in the twenty-first century*;Abstract The turn of the twenty-first century has borne witness to the seemingly relentless march of climate change, with global mean temperatures and sea levels projected to rise significantly in the near future. Despite considerable improvements in healthcare, mortality rates and life expectancy worldwide over the past few decades, there is increasing evidence postulating the potentially adverse impacts of environmental alterations on health in more ways than one. These not only involve direct and indirect climatic-related health impacts, but also those modulated by human aspects. Undeniably, there is a pressing need to recognize these issues and come up with appropriate solutions to address them as much as possible. Fortunately, this has led to the development of a wide range of measures encompassing both adaptation and mitigation strategies, alongside the recent Paris accords which highlight renewed global resolve in tackling these challenges in a collaborative and coordinated manner. However, progress has been relatively muted, and whether these prove to be the turning point remains very much to be seen. Nonetheless, taking the above into consideration, there is little doubt about the gravity of the situation, and that much more needs to be done to integrate and bring society forward in this new era.
37;Climate Change: Moving the Paris Agreement from Words to Deeds;Economic and social development the world has experienced in the last couple of centuries has been unprecedented, propelled by technological advances that have overcome famine and extended life expectancy in much of the world. This has been reflected in productivity gains in agriculture, industrial development, advances in communications, transport and energy never experienced in much of recorded history. But this has brought increases in CO2 emissions since the industrial age, whose full implications are as yet somewhat unpredictable. However, an increasingly widespread consensus has emerged that there is the need to reverse these emissions to prevent global average temperature increases to less than 2 Celsius. The Agreement reached by the 195 countries in climate talks in Paris requires an overhaul of historic proportions for energy policies worldwide and investment of the order of $16.5 trillion of spending on renewables and efficiency, as well as carbon capture and storage through 2030, to meet the agreed targets outlined, as estimated by the International Energy Agency. In essence, the deal aims at limiting global temperature increase since the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries to 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), while calling on nations to “pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 degrees.” The Paris Agreement provides a framework for such effort, and will require significant reductions in hydrocarbons investments, increases in emissions costs, reduction in deforestation, intensive reengineering of energy sources in use, and profound changes in transport systems. None of this will take place on its own or be politically, economically and technically easy. Henceforth emphasis must focus on how to move from words to deeds in a manner that does not affect negatively economic development. This article is focused on four areas that need special attention to ensure that future efforts can adequately address concerns of efficiency and effectiveness, which have hitherto received scant attention, with consequent limited progress and results in climate change actions. As there are few precedents in this emerging area, this article is based on benchmark analysis the author has conducted to assist several Governments in designing policies to deal with the emerging issues climate change is posing.
38;Food systems and life expectancy with rapid urbanisation in provincial China.;BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Health outcomes such as survival, minimal disability and well-being are presumptively dependent on food and ecosystems. An integral measure of the critical urban food system linkages to health problems is needed. Much of the current health change in cities could be attributed to short-comings in food systems which can pose threats to food security and food safety. Health problems have needed a reconceptualisation of present medical and nutritional constructs.   METHODS AND STUDY DESIGN The present study is based on a situational analysis of food and the related ecosystems presumptively affected by rapid urbanisation in China. With an ecological information matrix, an Urban Food System Index with ten indicators which could influence food system outcomes and promote health and well-being has been developed. It uses sixteen data sets from the National Bureau of Statistics for all 31 provinces in China. The indicators were Locality, Climate, Biodiversity, Infrastructure, Transport, Population structure, Livelihood, Recreation and Socialisation, Personal security and Communication. The indicators for each province, scored between 1 (severe) and 5 (best), were used to predict life expectancy for China as a whole by multivariable regression analysis.   RESULTS The best model explained 70% of the variance and had significant beta coefficients for population structure (proportion of juveniles) (-0.52, p<0.0001) and livelihood (food expenditure) (0.31, p<0.05).   CONCLUSIONS Population characteristics and livelihoods related to food systems can account for much of life expectancy as a health outcome. An index which captured this in-formation is provided and could evaluate concurrently as well as prospectively food system-related health with urbanisation.
39;Impact of climate change on elder health.;Demographers predict human life expectancy will continue to increase over the coming century. These forecasts are based on two critical assumptions: advances in medical technology will continue apace and the environment that sustains us will remain unchanged. The consensus of the scientific community is that human activity contributes to global climate change. That change will degrade air and water quality, and global temperature could rise 11.5°F by 2100. If nothing is done to alter this climatic trajectory, humans will be confronted by a broad spectrum of radical environmental challenges. Historically, children and the elderly adults account for most of the death toll during times of severe environmental stress. This article makes an assessment from a geriatric viewpoint of the adverse health consequences that global climate change will bring to the older segments of future populations in the United States.
40;U.S. Childhood Obesity and Climate Change: Moving Toward Shared Environmental Health Solutions;Abstract This article focuses on the epidemic of childhood obesity, a significant cause of pediatric morbidity in the United States. It begins with a review of the evidence regarding environmental influences on obesity. Then it draws from that evidence to cite examples of climate change prevention and preparedness efforts that could also benefit the obesity problem. Climate change is a global environmental issue predicted to negatively impact children's health. In the United States, many regions are expected to experience worse air quality, increased vector-borne disease, and changes in food availability. Children's size, developmental stage, and long life expectancy make them unique when considering health effects from the environment. Furthermore, in the latter part of this century, the children of today will become seniors, a group also vulnerable to predicted health impacts from climate change. These vulnerabilities will contribute to existing health disparities that are due, in part, to unequal risk ...
41;Uneven Futures of Human Lifespans: Reckonings from Gompertz Mortality Rates, Climate Change, and Air Pollution;The past 200 years have enabled remarkable increases in human lifespans through improvements in the living environment that have nearly eliminated infections as a cause of death through improved hygiene, public health, medicine, and nutrition. We argue that the limit to lifespan may be approaching. Since 1997, no one has exceeded Jeanne Calment's record of 122.5 years, despite an exponential increase of centenarians. Moreover, the background mortality may be approaching a lower limit. We calculate from Gompertz coefficients that further increases in longevity to approach a life expectancy of 100 years in 21st century cohorts would require 50% slower mortality rate accelerations, which would be a fundamental change in the rate of human aging. Looking into the 21st century, we see further challenges to health and longevity from the continued burning of fossil fuels that contribute to air pollution as well as global warming. Besides increased heat waves to which elderly are vulnerable, global warming is anticipated to increase ozone levels and facilitate the spread of pathogens. We anticipate continuing socioeconomic disparities in life expectancy.
42;The inclusion of immediate and lagged climate responses amplifies the effect of climate autocorrelation on long‐term growth rate of populations;Climate variability will increase with climate change, and thus it is important for population ecologists to understand its consequences for population dynamics. Four components are known to mediate the consequences of climate variability: the magnitude of climate variability, the effect size of climate on vital rates, covariance between vital rates and autocorrelation in climate. Recent studies have pointed to a potential fifth component: vital rates responding to climate in different timeframes, with some responding more immediately and some having lagged responses. We use simulations to quantify how all five components modify the consequences of climatic variability on long‐term population growth rates across a range of life histories defined by life expectancy and iteroparity. We use an established method to compose Matrix Population Models for 147 life histories. Our simulations show that including different timeframes for vital rates responses to climate can either reduce or amplify the negative influence of climate variability on long‐term population growth rates. The negative effect of different timeframes for vital rates responses on population growth is amplified when climatic autocorrelations are negative, and when species are long‐lived. Synthesis. The existing literature shows that vital rates often respond to climate in different timeframes, and that studies often ignore climate autocorrelation. Our results show that simultaneously including both of these factors can substantially increase or decrease a population's expected growth rate. Moreover, the relative magnitude of this change increases with the generation time of a life history. Our results are relevant to conservation, population forecasts and population modelling in general.
43;Climate, desertification, and local human development: evidence from 1564 regions around the world;How global warming affects human development is a central question for economists as well as social scientists. While most of the literature has focused on the impact of weather on income, less is known on the relationship between climate and local human development. This paper considers shocks in precipitation, temperature, and an original measure of soil aridity to first exploit the association between climate warming and human development, and second, on its dimensions. We show that while precipitations do not have a significant long-term impact on human development growth, variations in temperature and potential evapotranspiration negatively affect two of the three determinants of the Human Development Index, namely life expectancy at birth and education. These results suggest that other climate indicators, such as the potential evapo-transpiration of the soil, should be considered in addition to the standard indicators, when evaluating the localized economic effects of climate change.
44;New perspectives on later life learning in the age of longevity;: Recent decades have witnessed the ageing of populations in many countries across the world accompanied by unprecedented social, cultural, and technological change as well as recognition of the implications of climate change. As this demographic transformation has posed a full range of challenges to policy dimensions in certain countries, the importance of older people being able to access appropriate learning opportunities has become more widely recognised. Increasingly, it is understood that this is necessary not only for the economies of different countries, which may require people to remain for longer in the labour market but also as an essential component of a fulfilling later life. However, a focus only on chronological age and ageing fails to allow for the more positive aspects of what may be termed “the longevity effect” which has been driven by a better understanding of the factors that influence increased life expectancy in different countries, enabling people to live longer, happier and more productive lives. It is argued firstly that we need to rethink the current focus on “aging” and replace it with a more positive emphasis on “longevity” that includes an understanding of what happens to our brains as we grow older. Secondly, the concept of “long life learning” which is beginning to appear in different contexts is explored. Thirdly, it is acknowledged that the worldwide spread of COVID-19 has both opened up some novel ways of helping some older people to learn and, simultaneously, widened the so-called digital divide. Finally, the pernicious influence of ageism is considered.
45;Declining trends of healthy life years expectancy (HLYE) in Europe;"We examine the trends in Healthy Life Years Expectancy (HLYE) at birth during the past few decades in Europe. We observe that several European countries show a significant drop in HLYE at birth starting from 2003; interrupting what had been a previous continuous increase. We discuss the possible causes of this drop, including a possible correlation with climate change in terms of the heat wave experienced in Europe in 2003. It is not possible, at present, to propose a single explanation for this phenomenon, however the trend is worrisome and its causes should be investigated further."
46;A Welfare Analysis of Climate Change Mitigation Policies;This paper assesses some welfare consequences of climate change mitigation policies. In the same vein as Becker, Philipson and Soares (2005), a simple index of economic progress weighs in the monetary cost induced by mitigation policies as well as the health benefits arising from the reduction in local air pollution. The shadow price of pollution is calculated indirectly through its impact on life expectancy. Taking into account the health benefits of mitigation policies significantly reduces their monetary cost in China and India, as well as in countries with large fossil-based energy-producing sectors (Australia, Canada and the United States). L'impact des politiques d'attenuation du changement climatique sur le bien-etre economique Cette etude evalue certaines consequences des politiques d’attenuation du changement climatique sur le bien-etre economique. Suivant l’approche de Becker, Philipson et Soares (2005), un indice de progres economique est propose, combinant le cout monetaire des politiques d’abattement d’emissions de gaz a effet de serre ainsi que les benefices pour la sante de la reduction de la pollution de l’air qui en decoule. Le prix implicite de la pollution est calcule indirectement a travers son impact sur l’esperance de vie. La prise en compte des benefices sur la sante des politiques d’attenuation reduit le cout monetaire de la lutte contre le changement climatique baisse de maniere significative en Chine et en Inde, ainsi que dans le cas de pays a forte production d’energie fossile (l’Australie, le Canada et les Etats-Unis).
47;Your money or your life? The carbon-development paradox;The relationship between human health and well-being, energy use and carbon emissions is a foremost concern in sustainable development. If past advances in well-being have been accomplished only through increases in energy use, there may be significant trade-offs between achieving universal human development and mitigating climate change. We test the explanatory power of economic, dietary and modern energy factors in accounting for past improvements in life expectancy, using a simple novel method, functional dynamic decomposition. We elucidate the paradox that a strong correlation between emissions and human development at one point in time does not imply that their dynamics are coupled in the long term. Increases in primary energy and carbon emissions can account for only a quarter of improvements in life expectancy, but are closely tied to growth in income. Facing this carbon-development paradox requires prioritizing human well-being over economic growth.
48;Social Impacts of Climate Change in Chile: A Municipal Level Analysis of the Effects of Recent and Future Climate Change on Human Development and Inequality;This paper uses municipality level data to estimate the general relationship between climate, income, and life expectancy in Chile. The analysis finds that incomes are negatively related to temperature, while life expectancy is not significantly related to average temperatures. Both incomes and life expectancy are greater in areas with either very little rain or a lot of rain. The authors use the estimated relationships to simulate the effects of both past (1958-08) and future (2008-58) climate change. The findings indicate that past climate change has been favorable for the central, and most populous, part of Chile, and it has contributed to reduced poverty and reduced inequality of health outcomes. Whereas temperatures in the past have shown a downward trend for most of the Chilean population, climate models suggest that they will increase in the future, and that there will be a reduction in precipitation in the central part of Chile. The analysis simulates the likely effects of these projected climate changes over the next 50 years. The findings suggest that expected future climate will tend to reduce incomes across the whole country, with an average reduction of about 7 percent, all other things equal.
49;Critical Review of Polymeric Building Envelope Materials: Degradation, Durability and Service Life Prediction;"This paper provides a critical review of the degradation, durability and service life prediction (SLP) of polymeric building envelope materials (BEMs), namely, claddings, air/vapour barriers, insulations, sealants, gaskets and fenestration. The rate of material deterioration and properties determine the usefulness of a product; therefore, knowledge of the significant degradation mechanisms in play for BEMs is key to the design of proper SLP methods. SLP seeks to estimate the life expectancy of a material/component exposed to in-service conditions. This topic is especially important with respect to the potential impacts of climate change. The surrounding environment of a building dictates the degradation mechanisms in play, and as climate change progresses, material aging conditions become more unpredictable. This can result in unexpected changes and/or damages to BEMs, and shorter than expected SL. The development of more comprehensive SLP methods is economically and environmentally sound, and it will provide more confidence, comfort and safety to all building users. The goal of this paper is to review the existing literature in order to identify the knowledge gaps and provide suggestions to address these gaps in light of the rapidly evolving climate."
50;Social Impacts of Climate Change in Peru: A District Level Analysis of the Effects of Recent and Future Climate Change on Human Development and Inequality;This paper uses district level data to estimate the general relationship between climate, income and life expectancy in Peru. The analysis finds that both incomes and life expectancy show hump-shaped relationships, with optimal average annual temperatures around 18-20oC. These estimated relationships were used to simulate the likely effects of both past (1958-2008) and future (2008-2058) climate change. At the aggregate level, future climate change in Peru is estimated to cause a small reduction in average life expectancy of about 0.2 years. This average, however, hides much larger losses in the already hot areas as well as substantial gains in currently cold areas. Similarly, the average impact on incomes is a modest reduction of 2.3 percent, but with some districts experiencing losses of up to 20 percent and others gains of up to 13 percent. Future climate change is estimated to cause an increase in poverty (all other things equal), but to have no significant effect on the distribution of incomes.
51;Utilization of Climate Files Predicting Future Weather in Dynamic Building Performance Simulation – A review;As the climate is changing and buildings are designed with a life expectancy of 50+ years, it is sensible to take climate change into account during the design phase. Data representing future weather are needed so that building performance simulations can predict the impact of climate change. Currently, this usually requires one year of weather data with a temporal resolution of one hour, which represents local climate conditions. However, both the temporal and spatial resolution of global climate models is generally too coarse. Two general approaches to increase the resolution of climate models - statistical and dynamical downscaling have been developed. They exist in many variants and modifications. The present paper aims to provide a comprehensive overview of future weather application as well as critical insights in the model and method selection. The results indicate a general trend to select the simplest methods, which often involves a compromise on selecting climate models.
52;Climate, diseases, and the origins of corruption;It has been commonly observed that tropical countries typically suffer from intense corruption and underdevelopment. I offer an explanation for this long-standing disparity across the world based on variation in the intensity of ultraviolet radiation (UV-R). The central idea of this paper holds that UV-R is positively associated with the (historical) prevalence of eye diseases, which significantly shortens work-life expectancy as a skilled worker. This arguably shapes the global pattern of corrupt practices. Interestingly, this finding appears to be strong and insensitive to accounting for different theories explaining differences in corruption levels across the globe. Further analyses using individual-level data taken from the World Values Survey and provincial level data for China lend strong credence to the cross-country evidence.
53;Back to Nature: Medicinal Plants as Promising Sources for Antibacterial Drugs in the Post-Antibiotic Era;Undoubtedly, the advent of antibiotics in the 19th century had a substantial impact, increasing human life expectancy. However, a multitude of scientific investigations now indicate that we are currently experiencing a phase known as the post-antibiotic era. There is a genuine concern that we might regress to a time before antibiotics and confront widespread outbreaks of severe epidemic diseases, particularly those caused by bacterial infections. These investigations have demonstrated that epidemics thrive under environmental stressors such as climate change, the depletion of natural resources, and detrimental human activities such as wars, conflicts, antibiotic overuse, and pollution. Moreover, bacteria possess a remarkable ability to adapt and mutate. Unfortunately, the current development of antibiotics is insufficient, and the future appears grim unless we abandon our current approach of generating synthetic antibiotics that rapidly lose their effectiveness against multidrug-resistant bacteria. Despite their vital role in modern medicine, medicinal plants have served as the primary source of curative drugs since ancient times. Numerous scientific reports published over the past three decades suggest that medicinal plants could serve as a promising alternative to ineffective antibiotics in combating infectious diseases. Over the past few years, phenolic compounds, alkaloids, saponins, and terpenoids have exhibited noteworthy antibacterial potential, primarily through membrane-disruption mechanisms, protein binding, interference with intermediary metabolism, anti-quorum sensing, and anti-biofilm activity. However, to optimize their utilization as effective antibacterial drugs, further advancements in omics technologies and network pharmacology will be required in order to identify optimal combinations among these compounds or in conjunction with antibiotics.
54;Global climate change and its impact on disease embedded in ecological communities;We present the techniques of qualitative analysis of complex communities and discuss the impact of climate change as a press perturbation. In particular, we focus on the difficult problem of disease and parasites embedded in animal communities, notably zoonotic diseases. Climate change can potentially affect population densities of hosts and vectors, as well as their life expectancy. Recent advances may provide insight in predicting change in risk of zoonotic disease following climate shifts. We conclude that the impact of change on ecological communities can be profound but subtle, complex, and ambiguous, even under basic mathematical assumptions about the structure of a community when in equilibrium.
55;The Effect of Environmental Deterioration and Socio-Cultural Factors on Economic Sustainability in Asia Pacific Selected Countries;"Many studies and scholars focus on the impact of climate change and pollution on economic green growth, linked to cultural variables. The discussed socio-cultural factors are measured by World Values Surveys, and environmental deterioration presented as different types of pollution are both independently essential for economic sustainability. The article refers to the socio-cultural index and sustainability. Environmental deterioration index as calculated by principal component analysis; Socio-cultural index formed by culture dimensions most of them mentioned by Hofstede (1980) such as masculinity, individualism and power distance; also, social development, and life expectancy and education level. Based on Environmental Kuznets Curve, there is a strong linkage among environmental degradation and income level. This paper applies Panel data by using generalized least square estimation; due to the existence of heteroskedasticity and serial correlation validate by Durbin-Watson test and Breusch-Pagan test respectively. The data was taken from World Value Surveys and European Value Surveys for Hofstede dimensions; World Bank such as GDP per capita, FDI, life expectancy at birth, tertiary school enrollment, and land pollution; and BP statistics of world energy for CO2 over years 2000–2022. The results show negative causal relationship between socio-cultural and economic sustainability and, a positive impact of environmental deterioration on economic."
56;Disease and Healing in the Indus Civilisation;Disease and Healing in the Indus Civilisation presents a synthesis of what is currently known about health, disease and healing in the Indus Civilisation in the third to early second millennia BCE, underpinned by original research. It is the result of a detailed study of published human skeletal remains and material culture, with an increasing awareness of the natural environment. When combined with a knowledge of palaeoepidemiology and the natural history of disease, ancient climate change, and what is known of healing and health in contemporary Bronze Age societies of the Near East, with which the Indus Civilisation was in contact, it has been possible to piece together a picture of diseases in the period, the practice of healing and the development of public health. For the first time, the book illustrates the health, life expectancy, and the illnesses and injuries from which those at the bottom of society suffered, both at work and at home.
57;Dynamics of the human development index: trends and challenges;The Human Development Index (HDI) has had positive dynamics since 1990 as an overall indicator for evaluating achievements in three basic dimensions of human development: long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. The challenges of recent years with short- and long-term consequences have changed the HDI trend. The article, based on the research of modern scientists and experts, analyzes the reasons for the current trajectory of the human development index and identifies its potential trends. The hypothesis of hysteresis as a new feature that determines the dynamics of the Human Development Index became the starting point for analyzing the direct and indirect consequences of the components forming hysteresis. The COVID-19 pandemic creates the phenomenon of hysteresis about human development, the intensification of military conflicts, and climate change. The COVID-19 pandemic has led to the loss of human lives, reduced life expectancy, interrupted access to education, and caused economic recession in the global economy. The COVID-19 pandemic caused an economic recession, because of which the global GDP decreased, incomes decreased, and the trend toward a decrease in poverty level stopped against the background of a growing debt burden. In addition to the direct effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an indirect impact on people’s health: deteriorating mental health due to isolation and domestic violence. The escalation of military conflicts led to the death of people and, an increase in the number of forcibly displaced persons, the destruction of housing, educational institutions, and infrastructure facilities. Climate change has increased the risks of food insecurity and outbreaks of epidemics, and the number of victims of natural disasters has increased. The article states that UNDP experts see the causes of hysteresis in mismanagement: an inadequate response to the COVID-19 pandemic, allowing military conflicts, the consequences of which go beyond the borders of war-torn countries, insufficient efforts to mitigate the consequences of climate change. The established HDI trend can be changed by a new outlook, improved policies, and institutions that will contribute to the production of global public goods.  Keywords: human Development Index, hysteresis phenomenon, economic development, world economy, sustainable development goals.
58;Causes and Consequences of Air Pollution in Nepal;This rapid evidence review explores the causes and consequences of air pollution in Nepal, focusing on particulate matter (PM2.5) and drawing from academic and grey literature. While evidence is expanding, there are geographical and thematic gaps, notably with more studies conducted in Kathmandu Valley. Major causes include urbanisation, vehicular emissions, brick kilns, and transboundary pollution. Health impacts are severe, reducing life expectancy and causing cardiovascular and lung diseases, with economic costs amounting to over 6% of GDP. Political and environmental dimensions are also crucial, including impacts on education and tourism, and the need for coordinated efforts to address both air quality and climate change.
59;Earth: An Oxidative Planet with Limited Atom Resources and Rich Chemistry.;"Humanity faces an unprecedented survival challenge: climate change, driven by the depletion of natural resources, excessive waste generation, and deforestation. Six out of nine planetary boundaries have been exceeded, signaling that Earth is far from a safe operating space for humanity. In this Viewpoint Article we explore three critical ""atomic-molecular"" challenges: Earth's limited atomic resources, its oxidative nature, and very rich chemistry. Addressing these requires a transformation in how we produce and consume, emphasizing sustainable practices aligned with the United Nations' 17 goals. The advancement of science and technology has extended human life expectancy and improved quality of life. However, to ensure a sustainable future, we must move towards less oxidative chemical processes, incorporate CH4-CO2 redox chemistry into the circular economy, and transition from a linear, fossil fuel-dependent economy to a circular bioeconomy. Reforestation and the recovery of degraded lands are essential, alongside the shift towards green and sustainable chemistry. Earth's dynamic chemistry is governed by the principles of thermodynamics and kinetics, but science alone is insufficient. Achieving global sustainability requires coordinated economic, political, and social decisions that recognize Earth's limited resources and oxidative nature. Together, these efforts will position humanity to meet the challenges of climate change and secure a sustainable future."
60;Global 5-methylcytosine-RNA disruption reduces the vectorial competence to DENV2 of heatwave-exposed Aedes aegypti mosquitoes;Heatwaves are an increasingly common environmental event linked with climate change. Abnormally high heatwave temperatures can affect several mosquito vector traits that are determinants of pathogen transmission. Understanding how these mosquitoes adapt to high heat is vital for global public health. RNA methylation, a key cellular mechanism in stress response and adaptation, remains understudied in mosquito vector competence and heat stress responses. This study investigates the role of RNA methylation in mosquito responses to heatwaves and its influence on DENV2 vector competence. Heatwave-exposed and DENV-infected mosquitoes presented lower survivorship and lower antiviral transcriptional response, developed high infection rates, and increased the life expectancy of infected mosquitoes during the period of highest virus transmissibility. In contrast, inhibition of RNA methylation in heatwave-treated mosquitoes increased survivorship and the antiviral transcriptional response, reducing infection prevalence from 78% to 37%. These results indicate that the RNA methylation background in mosquitoes favors vector competence for DENV2 during a heatwave exposure, and points towards possible interventions to countermeasure the effect of climate change on DENV transmission.
61;Multivariate Analysis and Anomaly Detection of a US Reservoir Sedimentation Data Set;: Sedimentation processes continuously occurring in reservoirs can jeopardize their functionality, and compromise dam safety. Climate change and associated hydrologic uncertainty are introducing additional stressors to US reservoirs, several of them approaching the end of their design life. The US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) developed the Enhancing Reservoir Sedimentation Information for Climate Preparedness and Resilience (RSI) system to improve reservoir storage information, evaluate reservoir aggradation and life expectancy trends, and improve climate preparedness and resilience. The objective of this study was to detect anomalous records and identify multivariate relationships between RSI data for 184 reservoirs and associated watershed variables related to erosion and sedimentation processes such as topography, land use, and precipitation descriptors. The analyses included preliminary data filtering, Autonomous Anomaly Detection (AAD), Kolmogorov-Smirnov and Efran (KSE) anomaly detection, and Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA results indicated that sedimentation rates and capacity losses had strong relationships with drainage basin size and runoff processes (Curve Number) while being independent of elevation-related properties. A total of 20 reservoirs had anomalous records detected. Variables with large Z-scores for anomalous records, likely contributing to their detection, were related to elevation characteristics (watershed and channel slopes, and minimum elevation), precipitation trends (maximum and cumulative monthly precipitation), dam properties (time since dam completion and initial trap efficiency), and curve number. Study results will enable the refinement of the RSI dataset to provide reliable information regarding USACE reservoir conditions and support the development of indicators related to climate change’s impact on sedimentation.
62;Demography and natural history of the damselfly Mesamphiagrion gaudiimontanum (Coenagrionidae), a Páramo endemic species in the Colombian Andes;The páramos are high mountain ecosystems in the tropical regions of the New World, and they are particularly threatened by climate change. The Belmira páramo complex in Colombia is home to Mesamphiagrion gaudiimontanum, an endemic and endangered damselfly species. This study presents the first demographic assessment of M. gaudii­montanum using the capture-recapture method to estimate population size, survival, and detection probabilities, focusing on differences in age, sex, female color morphs, and parasite infestation. The population size was estimated to be 730 ± 186.59 individuals, with an average survival probability of 0.89 ± 0.04 and a life expectancy of 8.34 days, these data are like the reported for other populations in the same genus in harsh environmental conditions. Ectoparasitic mites were more common on juveniles than adults. After several hours of observing the species few copula events have been recorded, all of them involving juvenile adult females, which points to a monandrous reproduction syndrome for the species. Another phenomenon observed in the species was a change in coloration due to body temperature in individuals, in which bright coloration becomes grayish in cold weather. This study provides fundamental data for future monitoring and conservation efforts, highlighting the species’ vulnerability to environmental changes and the need for specific conservation strategies.
63;Towards Hope As Practice;Low-income neighbourhoods in our cities are often poorly-planned spaces that exacerbate socioeconomic disparities their residents face. These inequities also impact their health, especially communities in the Global South who are vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. One such example of an inadequately planned rehabilitation neighbourhood is Natwar Parekh in Mumbai’s Govandi. Over 25, 000 former slum dwellers - the population of a tier 3 city - have been crammed into 61 seven-storey buildings, with 80% homes having little to no access to sunlight or ventilation. The area is flanked by Asia’s largest landfill and polluting industries, creating an unhealthy environment with poor air quality and contamination. Tuberculosis and other diseases are on the rise here and the average life expectancy is just 39 years, almost half the national average. Govandi is ghettoised and neglected by the rest of Mumbai. Children who grew up here hesitate to mention their address because of the stigma attached to living here. Burdened by this shame and loss, Govandi’s youth came together seven years ago to work with a group of artists and urban practitioners from Community Design Agency (CDA), a social design organisation, to reimagine their neighbourhood. Together, they have redesigned garbage-filled alleyways into accessible streets, painted vibrant murals, and held the first-ever Govandi Arts Festival that allowed them to redefine their narratives of the place they call home. These initiatives have brought the community closer, made them more resilient, and even prompted spatial improvements by city authorities who were forced to turn their gaze here.  This essay explores the interlinkages between spatial improvements via arts and placemaking initiatives and their effects on the physical and emotional well-being of Govandi’s youth. Urban practitioners Natasha Sharma and Sandra Alexander from CDA explore methodologies for regenerative place-making in this vulnerable neighbourhood.
64;An Overview of Sargassum Seaweed as Natural Anticancer Therapy;"Algae have great therapeutic value and have attracted a great deal of attention due to the abundance of bioactive compounds they contain, which may be the key to fighting diseases of various origins, such as skin cancer, breast cancer, or osteosarcoma. In this regard, global trends indicate that cancer is likely to become the leading cause of death and the main obstacle to increased life expectancy in the 21st century, which is related to multiple factors, including the various effects of climate change, which will continue to cause afflictions to human health. Then, excess exposure to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) causes damage to DNA, proteins, enzymes, and various cellular structures and leads to the development of cancer, premature aging of the skin (wrinkles, dryness, dilation of blood vessels, and loss of collagen and elastin), or alterations of the immune system. In addition, multidrug resistance (MDR) is characterized by the overexpression of efflux pumps, such as P-glycoprotein or P-gp, that expel chemotherapeutic drugs out of the cancer cell being the main obstacle to their efficacy. Some molecules inhibit efflux pumps when co-administered with antineoplastic agents, such as glycolipids. Mycosporin-like amino acids and glycolipids isolated from Sargassum have shown an important role as potential anticancer agents. The results show that glycolipids and mycosporin-like amino acids present in brown algae of the genus Sargassum exhibit cytotoxic effects on different types of cancer, such as breast cancer, leukemia, and osteosarcoma, which is a key criterion to be considered as a natural anti-cancer strategy; but, more in-depth in vitro studies are needed to represent them at the in vivo level, as well as their validation in preclinical assays."
65;Ensuring Global Health Equity in a Post-pandemic Economy;With coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) receding, many countries are pondering what a post-pandemic economy should look like. Some advocate a more inclusive stakeholder model of capitalism. Others caution that this would be insufficient to deal with our pre-pandemic crises of income inequality and climate change. Many countries emphasize a ‘green recovery’ with improved funding for health and social protection. Progressive tax reform and fiscal policy innovations are needed, but there is concern that the world is already tilting towards a new round of austerity. Fundamentally, the capitalist growth economy rests on levels of material consumption that are unsustainable and inequitable. More radical proposals thus urge ‘degrowth’ policies to reduce consumption levels while redistributing wealth and income to allow the poorer half of humanity to achieve an ethical life expectancy. We have the policy tools to do so. We need an activist public health movement to ensure there is sufficient political will to adopt them
66;Climate warming decreases the survival of the little auk (Alle alle), a high Arctic avian predator;"Delayed maturity, low fecundity, and high adult survival are traits typical for species with a long-life expectancy. For such species, even a small change in adult survival can strongly affect the population dynamics and viability. We examined the effects of both regional and local climatic variability on adult survival of the little auk, a long-lived and numerous Arctic seabird species. We conducted a mark-resighting study for a period of 8 years (2006-2013) simultaneously at three little auk breeding sites that are influenced by the West Spitsbergen Current, which is the main carrier of warm, Atlantic water into the Arctic. We found that the survival of adult little auks was negatively correlated with both the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index and local summer sea surface temperature (SST), with a time lag of 2 and 1 year, respectively. The effects of NAO and SST were likely mediated through a change in food quality and/or availability: (1) reproduction, growth, and development of Arctic Calanus copepods, the main prey of little auks, are negatively influenced by a reduction in sea ice, reduced ice algal production, and an earlier but shorter lasting spring bloom, all of which result from an increased NAO; (2) a high sea surface temperature shortens the reproductive period of Arctic Calanus, decreasing the number of eggs produced. A synchronous variation in survival rates at the different colonies indicates that climatic forcing was similar throughout the study area. Our findings suggest that a predicted warmer climate in the Arctic will negatively affect the population dynamics of the little auk, a high Arctic avian predator."
67;Impact of economic growth, natural resources and trade on ecological footprint: do education and longevity promote sustainable development in Algeria?;ABSTRACT The world needs to move quickly towards sustainability that should characterize all production and consumption patterns. The global economic growth which was built on natural resources and biodiversity over centuries has resulted in two main issues: environmental degradation and climate change. This created a big challenge in the recent decades related to balancing economic growth with environmental quality preservation, which has been a hot topic capturing the interest of researchers from different disciplines. One of the possible ways to reduce environmental degradation while enhancing economic growth is investing in human capital. This study investigates the determinants of ecological footprint as a proxy for environmental quality in Algeria from 1980 to 2017 using several economic indicators. Another objective of the present study is to assess how education and life expectancy as social indicators can influence the environmental quality. The autoregressive distributed lags (ARDL) approach is used to estimate the constructed environmental degradation models. As expected, the obtained findings show that import is a significant factor that reduces ecological footprint in the long- and the short-run contrary to economic growth, energy use, export and natural resources rent. Moreover, the findings show that education and life expectancy increase environmental degradation in the short-run. However, while life expectancy keeps increasing environmental degradation in the long-run, education reduces it. In light of these findings, the current study provides several recommendations for better management of the country’s natural and human resources, which could help policymakers in directing the country towards sustainable development.
68;STRONG SUSTAINABILITY ASPECTS IN THE IDEATION PROCESS: A PEDAGOGICAL EXPERIMENT;Abstract The progress of science and technology has considerably increased the quality of life - especially the material standard of living - (e.g. disappearance of famines, increase in life expectancy) On the other hand, climate change, reduction of biodiversity, decrease of natural resources, and increase of environmental risks are some of the consequences of this human activities. Addressing these new challenges will require holistic comprehension and actionable approaches. The mitigation of these consequences requires effective responses in terms of transition. In this context, engineering and design students need time but also adapted curricula focused on sustainability and eco design concepts to support evolution of their skills, their knowledge and their culture. This article discusses the integration of a strong sustainability knowledge within the ideation process through a pedagogical experience, in order to develop new knowledge-based approaches, methodologies and tools
69;Impact of bursting fireworks during Diwali in Durgapur suburb, India: A case study;The current state of air pollution is very difficult to ignore, and it reduces life expectancy due to increased morbidity and mortality rate, and not only that, it also affects climate change. Therefore, air pollution monitoring and control need to be considered as one of the biggest tasks for our future planet. Durgapur city, an industrial hub in West Bengal is considered in the present work to review air pollution during festivals. In our experimental study, significant changes are found in two events: Diwali days (typically October–November) and regular days (January considered here). We collected data from our pollution monitoring device on daily observations and 90 of the data collected was valid among all other pollutants like CO, NO2, SO2, we consider particulate matters (PM2.5 and PM10) and lay much greater stress on PM2.5, which is more dangerous among the two. The pollution level during the festival is found to be 806.95 μg/m3, while on other regular days, it was 432.69 μg/m3. We observe that from fireworks during Diwali, PM10 is more emitted than PM2.5 while PM2.5 is more due to industrial and vehicular emissions.
70;Environmental quality, healthcare and research and development in Saudi Arabia;"While global warming and climate change associated with increasing carbon dioxide are widely seen to be one of the most serious worldwide dangers to population health, little is known regarding “how” country alters the linkage between increasing CO2 emissions and population health outcomes. Current literature on the health effects of CO2 emissions recommends various factors that may establish a more robust link, including health expenditure and research and development. Therefore, the purpose of this inquiry is to examine the effectiveness of health expenditure and R&D in improving health outcomes through reducing CO2 emissions. Using data for Saudi Arabia over the period 2000–2018, the dynamic ordinary least squares (DOLS) technique shows that (i) health and R&D expenditures decrease infant mortality and increase life expectancy; (ii) health and R&D expenditures reduce CO2 emissions in all the estimated models; (iii) health and R&D expenditures can improve health outcomes through reducing CO2 emissions; and (iv) health and R&D expenditures have both direct and indirect effect on health outcomes. Policy implications and limitations are also discussed."
71;Role of novel protein sources in sustainably meeting future global requirements;Global population growth, increased life expectancy and climate change are all impacting world's food systems. In industrialised countries, many individuals are consuming significantly more protein than needed to maintain health, with the majority being obtained from animal products, including meat, dairy, fish and other aquatic animals. Current animal production systems are responsible for a large proportion of land and fresh-water use, and directly contributing to climate change through the production of greenhouse gases. Overall, approximately 60% of the global protein produced is used for animal and fish feed. Concerns about their impact on both human, and planetary health, have led to calls to dramatically curb our consumption of animal products. Underutilised plants, insects and single-cell organisms are all actively being considered as alternative protein sources. Each present challenges that need to be met before they can become economically viable and safe alternatives for food or feed. Many plant species contain anti-nutritional factors that impair the digestion and absorption of protein and micronutrients. Insects represent a potentially rich source of high-quality protein although, questions remain relating to digestibility, allergenicity and biosecurity. Algae, fungi and bacteria are also a rich source of protein and there is growing interest in the development of ‘cultured meat’ using stem cell technology. For the foreseeable future, it appears likely that the ‘protein-economy’ will remain mixed. The present paper reviews progress and future opportunities in the development of novel protein sources as food and animal feed.
72;Analysing the Effects of Environmental Changes on Public Health Quality Indicators;As global changes in the environment continue to shape communities, the link between changes in the environment and public health has become clearer. The many ways that changes in the environment can affect public health quality measures are looked at in this study. Air quality, water supply, urbanisation, and climate change are given special attention. As cities grow and more factories are built, the environment changes in ways that make health problems like lung diseases, water-borne diseases, and vector-borne diseases worse. Extreme weather events like storms, floods, and heat waves have also grown to be major determinant of public health. This study examines a lot of studies already conducted to ascertain how environmental changes could result in lower health measurements like life expectancy, mortality rates, and chronic illness prevalence. Furthermore emphasised in the study is the need of knowing how interdependent socioeconomic determinants of health are with external elements as these elements may make vulnerable populations even more vulnerable. The study reveals how environmentally friendly behaviour, modern technology, and government regulations could assist to mitigate the negative health consequences of environmental changes. It also looks at how environmental health tracking systems and predictive analytics can help shape public health policies and make sure that the right steps are taken at the right time. The study shows how careful environmental management and health policy can make public health systems more resilient by looking at global case studies and past data. The results show that to successfully deal with the problems caused by changes in the environment, we need to use interdisciplinary methods that take into account things like hospital infrastructure, environmental sustainability, and community resilience. To sum up, this study makes a strong case for making environmental health a central part of public health policy in order to improve people's quality of life, lower the number of diseases, and achieve long-lasting public health results in the face of ongoing environmental problems.
73;Exploring CO2 emission in developing countries by PCA and time series analysis;Carbon dioxide emission are major driver of global warming and climate change, hence one should urgently reduce carbon dioxide emission to avoid the impacts from climate change. With such a worldwide problem, the regulation and generalization have become a problem. When comparing each countries carbon dioxide emission data, mankind has missed lots of omitted variables including countries’ economics status, countries’ location etc. As the world enters the era of big data analysis, this study will mainly discuss why some developing countries cannot reduce carbon dioxide emission at the same rate as those developed countries. From the dataset, the research used 12 major carbon dioxide countries all over the world including both developing and developed countries. The research first performed explanatory data analysis to check if there is any association between carbon dioxide emission, GDP per capital, and life expectancy in all 12 countries. Then, the PCA classification is adopted to classify all the selected 12 countries, and one may see all the developing countries are classified in similar area. In the end, the study performed a SARIMA time series analysis on China’s future carbon dioxide emission, and the result showed a decline trend of China’s carbon dioxide emission in the future. This research will correct the misleading idea on simply compare with countries precisely carbon dioxide emission and help to understand the tradeoffs that many developing countries face during reduction of carbon dioxide.
74;Temperature and transmission: novel estimates of the effects of temperature on the human malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum;Malaria transmission is strongly influenced by traits such as mosquito life expectancy, vector competence, and the Extrinsic Incubation Period (EIP, which is the development time of the parasite inside the mosquito). Even though these traits are known to be shaped by environmental temperature and there is considerable concern that climate change could increase disease risk in certain areas, surprisingly, these temperature dependencies are poorly characterized. Here, we use a mechanistic model fitted to novel experimental data to describe how Plasmodium falciparum infection of the African malaria vector, Anopheles gambiae, is modulated by temperature, including its influences on parasite establishment, conversion efficiency through parasite developmental stages, EIP and overall competence. We use these data, together with novel estimates of the survival of infected blood-fed mosquitoes, to explore the potential influence of temperature on transmission in four locations in Kenya, considering recent conditions and future climate change. Results provide insights into factors limiting transmission in cooler environments and indicate that increases in malaria transmission efficiency due to climate warming in areas like the Kenyan Highlands, might be less than previously predicted.
75;"""Energy Sustainability and Human Welfare in Nigeria: Implications for Sustainable Development """;"""Despite the high propensity of energy usage in driving the economic activities, the issues of global climate change and global warming which pose enormous threats to human welfare have motivated the growing need for energy sustainability globally. In the light of the above, the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG 7) advocates for the usage of energy from cleaner sources. Meanwhile, impact of energy usage on human welfare has largely been the issue of concern among the scholars in Nigeria. Against this backdrop, this study examined energy sustainability and human welfare in Nigeria. Consequently, data was collected from secondary sources, and analyzed within the framework of Fully Modified Ordinary Least Squares (FMOLS) and Granger causality test. The summary of the principal findings in this is enunciated as follows; energy sustainability and life expectancy had a positive and significant relationship in Nigeria. Government expenditures on health had both negative and insignificant relationship with life expectancy in Nigeria. Also, there was a unidirectional causality flowing from life expectancy to electricity consumption from hydroelectric sources in Nigeria. Furthermore, one way feedback flows from government expenditure on health to life expectancy. From these findings, this study recommends that Nigeria would want to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals one (1) - promoting good life for the people, and seven (7) - affordable and clean energy simultaneously before the SDGs timeline elapses in 2030, the Nigerian policymakers and all stakeholders should be aggressively involved in energy sustainability movement in the country."""
76;The Expectation Disconfirmation Theory of Green Banking Practices of State Bank of India with special reference to Kerala - A Structural Equation Modeling Approach;In light of Agenda 2030, sustainability awareness is steadily growing worldwide. All institutions, including banks and financial institutions, are working to reduce their carbon footprints. Several indirect problems have arisen for India as a result of the banking process, such as global warming, climate change, irregular monsoon, air pollution, heavy rain, poor air quality, health problems, ozone depletion, fossil fuel use, recurrent destruction of forests for daily use, improper e-waste disposal. These issues can be overcome with sustainable banking practices (Green banking), which benefit the customer's satisfaction and quality of life. However, sustainability can be achieved only when the customers accept green banking and are satisfied with it. In order to do that, the bank must understand the level of expectations and perception of its customers toward green initiatives and to what extent the initiatives satisfy their day-to-day needs. This paper provides an overview of Expectancy disconfirmation integrations into customer satisfaction of India's largest public sector banks. As part of the present theoretical analysis, we first examine the level of awareness, expectations, and perception differences of customers to determine their satisfaction level. We then provide some evidence from SBI in Kerala regarding dissatisfying factors in green banking practices.
77;Behavioral Economics and Public Policy 102: Beyond Nudging;The United States, despite its affluence, faces a number of daunting policy challenges. We rank last among 16 wealthy peers in life expectancy, infant mortality, and obesity, and have taken very little action on climate change, despite the extremity of the threat it poses not only to future generations but even those alive today. 1
78;Analysis of the Relation Between Climate Changes and Security Area;"Abstract Security is often used in most meaningful concepts of contemporary political vocabulary. Furthermore, it concerns interesting aspects of the survival of nations and states in the world. In the first decade of the 21st century, mankind got into a qualitatively new phase of its development, in which it should invariably use the ""uncertainty"" area. There are no doubts about the facts that environmental pollution can cause a variety of ecologically based diseases and this in turn leads to reduction in the average life expectancy. This paper analyzes the relations between climate changes today and their impact on the security area. Problems that have arisen worldwide and in the Republic of Bulgaria because of the climate change are pointed out. The paper discuses directions for improving the security environment in the context of climate changes"
79;The Causal Nexus among Energy Consumption, Environmental Degradation, Financial Development and Health Outcome: Empirical Study for Pakistan;Pakistan is facing an energy crisis and is also severely affected by climate change. Moreover, Pakistan is not doing well as far as health outcome indicators are concerned. The causal nexus among energy, environment, and health outcomes is well-established in literature. Besides, financial development also grabs the attention of health outcome literature as financial development can play a significant role in improving health outcomes. Thus, this study was conducted to test the causal nexus among energy consumption, environmental degradation, financial development, and health outcomes in the case of Pakistan. This study proxies health outcomes with life expectancy and infant mortality. Time series data have been analyzed through different econometric techniques, such as unit root tests, cointegration techniques, causality techniques, and cointegration regressions. Moreover, this study not just discovers the causal direction among variables but also determines the strength of causality through variance decomposition. Results of the study confirm that all variables of the study are cointegrated in the long run. The causality analysis reveals that unidirectional causality is running from energy consumption and environmental degradation to health outcomes, whereas bidirectional causality is found between financial development and health outcomes in the long run. Besides, this study also determines the effect of energy, environmental degradation, and financial development in the health outcome model and finds that energy and financial development can help Pakistan to improve health outcomes. Policy implications are recommended for Pakistan.
80;Implementasi Energi Terbarukan dan Urgensinya Dalam Lingkungan Hidup Society 5.0;The main idea of transforming into society 5.0 is to integrate cyberspace and physical space. This transformation process needs energy in a large scale because it happens with the fast acceleration of digital transformation. The environment of today society is threatened by environmental problem known as climate change and global warming. These threats come from the usage of fossil fuel that powers our society as primary energy sources.

81;Bangladesh at Fifty: Changes and Challenges in Population and Development;Bangladesh turned 50 in 2021 having made remarkable progress in population and development, such as reducing total fertility and maternal mortality, boosting contraceptive prevalence, reducing infant and child mortality, increasing life expectancy at birth, and enhancing gender parity in schooling, women's empowerment, and overall development. This paper explores the past and determines the drivers of population change and development challenges, the current situation, and future trends and issues up to 2041—the year benchmarked for the country to attain 'developed' status. The study uses censuses, national-level surveys, population projections, and UN and World Bank data. Reducing total fertility, curbing child marriage, addressing adolescent motherhood and their unmet need for family planning, reducing high maternal mortality ratios, the double burden of diseases and malnutrition, addressing population ageing, high youth unemployment, low female labor force participation, and increased climate change vulnerabilities are critical challenges. The demographic dividend needs urgent action. To reach the SDGs by 2030, the country must eliminate unmet contraception needs, preventable maternal deaths, and gender-based violence, and harmful practices, including child marriages.
82;Modeling of Healthcare Monitoring System of Smart Cities;With the rapid development of information and communication technologies, the concept of a smart city has become a reality, and these smart cities are constantly increasing in most countries of the world because of the desire of governments to enhance the lives of their citizens and increase both efficiency and sustainability. The main idea of the concept of smart cities is to integrate the system of services in the cities such as health, energy, education, transportation, and public services, and provide them to citizens everywhere. As health monitoring is one of the most important applications of a smart city, this paper presents the issues of modeling a system for monitoring the health of various population groups of a smart city. The relevance of such systems is caused by the emergence of fundamentally new types of cities, an increase in the number and average life expectancy of the population, and the emergence of new diseases caused by climate change. The peculiarity of the system lies in its complex nature, i.e., it solves the problem of assessing the status of people requiring medical care, calling medical personnel, and monitoring the effectiveness of clinics by the government.
83;Community-Based Research as a Mechanism to Reduce Environmental Health Disparities in American Indian and Alaska Native Communities;Racial and ethnic minority communities, including American Indian and Alaska Natives, have been disproportionately impacted by environmental pollution and contamination. This includes siting and location of point sources of pollution, legacies of contamination of drinking and recreational water, and mining, military and agricultural impacts. As a result, both quantity and quality of culturally important subsistence resources are diminished, contributing to poor nutrition and obesity, and overall reductions in quality of life and life expectancy. Climate change is adding to these impacts on Native American communities, variably causing drought, increased flooding and forced relocation affecting tribal water resources, traditional foods, forests and forest resources, and tribal health. This article will highlight several extramural research projects supported by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) Science to Achieve Results (STAR) tribal environmental research grants as a mechanism to address the environmental health inequities and disparities faced by tribal communities. The tribal research portfolio has focused on addressing tribal environmental health risks through community based participatory research. Specifically, the STAR research program was developed under the premise that tribal populations may be at an increased risk for environmentally-induced diseases as a result of unique subsistence and traditional practices of the tribes and Alaska Native villages, community activities, occupations and customs, and/or environmental releases that significantly and disproportionately impact tribal lands. Through a series of case studies, this article will demonstrate how grantees—tribal community leaders and members and academic collaborators—have been addressing these complex environmental concerns by developing capacity, expertise and tools through community-engaged research.
84;Impact of Environmental Factors on the Risk of Cardiovascular Disease in the Population of the Arctic;Arctic territories are one of the priorities in the comprehensive geopolitical and geoeconomic development of the Russian Federation. In this regard, such issues as a new Arctic healthcare model, stabilization of the demographic processes, health protection, and increasing life expectancy of the indigenous and newcomer population are growing in importance. The Arctic is an area of special strategic interest to Russia not only because of the prospects for natural resource development, but also due to the rapid global climate change. The implementation of large-scale competitive projects requires an influx of labour force, leading to a predictable increase in the population of the Arctic settlements. Indigenous peoples living on the Arctic territories of the Russian Federation comprise a special population group, which needs state support due to the vulnerability of its traditional way of life and its original habitat. The state policy of sustainable development is being implemented with regard to them. This article presents a review of the literature analysing the impact of etiopathogenetic mechanisms of unfavourable climatic and geophysical factors on the human cardiovascular system in the Arctic. It has been shown that a significant proportion of the risks of cardiovascular events in the Arctic is linked to environmental pollution (as a result of active human economic activity) and to adverse climatic conditions. Improving the technologies of Arctic healthcare from the standpoint of 4P medicine (aimed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease) and understanding the mechanisms of the adverse effects of natural climatic and anthropogenic factors will significantly enhance the quality of medical care and preserve the health of the indigenous and newcomer population of the Russian Arctic.
85;COVID-19 Vulnerability Mapping of Asian Countries;Abstract Objective: The objective of this study is to map vulnerability of Asian countries to the COVID-19 pandemic. Method: According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 2007 framework for natural hazards, vulnerability is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. From an extensive literature review, we identified 16 socioeconomic, meteorological, environmental, and health factors that influence coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases and deaths. The underlying factors of vulnerability were identified using principal component analysis. Results: Our findings indicate that the percentage of the urban population, obesity rate, air connectivity, and the population aged 65 and over, diabetes prevalence, and PM2.5 levels all contributed significantly to COVID-19 sensitivity. Subsequently, governance effectiveness, human development index (HDI), vaccination rate, and life expectancy at birth, and gross domestic product (GDP) all had a positive effect on adaptive capacity. The estimated vulnerability was corroborated by a Pearson correlation of 0.615 between death per million population and vulnerability. Conclusion: This study demonstrates the application of universal indicators for assessing pandemic vulnerability for informed policy interventions such as the COVAX vaccine roll-out priority. Despite data limitations and a lack of spatiotemporal analysis, this study’s methodological framework allows for ample data incorporation and replication.
86;The Impact of Sustainability Goals on Productivity Growth: The Moderating Role of Global Warming;"The objective of this paper was to gain novel insights into the complex relationships among Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in shaping productivity (GDP/capita) growth. Using dynamic panel regressions on data collected in 138 countries between 2000 and 2017, we found that rising temperatures negatively affect growth and mitigate the impact of other SDGs on growth. We also found that CO2 emissions have a U-shaped relationship with growth; life expectancy negatively influences growth (positively moderated by rising temperatures), and food security positively impacts growth (negatively moderated by rising temperatures). This study highlights the difficulty of simultaneously implementing SDGs and elucidates novel research perspectives and policies to decrease the negative impacts of climate change on socio-economic and environmental well-being."
87;Aspirations and Strategies for Public Health.;Public health is responsible for extraordinary achievements over the past century, such as remarkable gains in life expectancy and substantial decreases in infectious disease mortality, and could make similar critical contributions to health in this century. Public health should be ascendant, but ample evidence suggests that it is on the defensive today, underappreciated, and underfunded. Government actions to improve the health of populations are widely suspect, as illustrated by the controversies involving efforts to curb soda container sizes in New York City, state and federal efforts to limit reproductive health rights, and global efforts to address climate change. By contrast, traditional medicine continues to be privileged. The burgeoning precision medicine agenda and the continuing emphasis on the treatment for cancer have captured the imagination of funding agencies
88;Exploring the spatiotemporal drivers of malaria elimination in Europe;Europe once had widespread malaria, but today it is free from endemic transmission. Changing land use, agricultural practices, housing quality, urbanization, climate change, and improved healthcare are among the many factors thought to have played a role in the declines of malaria seen, but their effects and relative contributions have rarely been quantified. Spatial datasets on changes in climate, wealth, life expectancy, urbanization, and land use trends over the past century were combined with datasets depicting the reduction in malaria transmission across 31 European countries, and the relationships were explored. Moreover, the conditions in current malaria-eliminating countries were compared with those in Europe at the time of declining transmission and elimination to assess similarities. Indicators relating to socio-economic improvements such as wealth, life expectancy and urbanization were strongly correlated with the decline of malaria in Europe, whereas those describing climatic and land use changes showed weaker relationships. Present-day malaria-elimination countries have now arrived at similar socio-economic indicator levels as European countries at the time malaria elimination was achieved, offering hope for achievement of sustainable elimination.
89;Warm‐night temperature alters paternal allocation strategy in a North temperate‐zone butterfly;Abstract Warming temperatures are greatly impacting wild organisms across the globe. Some of the negative impacts of climate change can be mitigated behaviorally, for example, by changes in habitat and oviposition site choice. Temperatures are reportedly warming faster at night than during the day, yet studies assessing the impacts of increasing night temperature are rare. We used the Finnish Glanville fritillary butterfly (Melitaea cinxia) as study species and exposed adult butterflies of both sexes to warmer night conditions. Under a seminatural outdoor enclosure, we assessed whether females base their oviposition choices primarily on habitat site characteristics (open, suggestive of dry meadows, versus covered by a coarse canopy, suggestive of pastures) or on plant condition (dry vs. lush), and if their choice is altered by the thermal conditions experienced at night. As exposure to warmer environmental conditions is expected to increase resting metabolic rate and potentially reduce life expectancy, we further assessed the fitness implications of warm‐night temperatures. We found that females prefer open sites for oviposition and that females do not switch their oviposition strategy based on the thermal conditions they experienced at night prior to the reproductive event. Exposure to warm nights did not influence female lifespan, but the egg hatching success of their offspring was reduced. In addition, we found that males exposed to warm nights sired larger clutches with higher hatching rate. As warm‐night exposure reduced male lifespan, this may imply a switch in male resource allocation strategy toward increased offspring quality. The present work adds on to the complex implications of climate warming and highlights the importance of the often‐neglected role of males in shaping offspring performance.
90;Standard of Living & Quality of Life Relies on Innovation: Innovation Relies on Engineering Design;Quality of life has advanced since the industrial revolution and this advancement has accelerated with the information revolution. Life expectancy has increased, catalytic converters protect our air, a disabled athlete runs with the fastest runners in the world 1 , and global real GDP per capita has grown by a factor of 2.5 over the past 50 years 2 . This quality of life advancement is the result of continuous innovation. In today’s global economy, innovation is essential for Canada to compete (even to participate) and to continue advancing our quality of life. Collective global innovation has never been more critical. World population growth (7 billion and counting), diminishing non-renewable resources (oil and beyond) and escalating environmental challenges (climate change and pollution) all require global scale innovations or our collective quality of life will not be sustained. Canadians have contributed much to the world including the telephone and smartphone, CANDU ® reactors, snowmobiles, IMAX ® , and the pacemaker. However, over the last number of years, there have been multiple reports critical of Canada’s capacity for technological innovation 3 and studies that offer strategies for improvement. 4 While it is true that innovation is essential to the future of both Canada and the world, innovation is only a means to an end and it is incumbent on us to define the desired ends. Innovation can be a means to a higher quality of life and a more sustainable future for generations to come or it can simply be a means to increase the financial prosperity of the nation. To achieve the ends we value, it is essential to measure innovation in terms of these ends, not in terms of subtle differences in the rate of change in the GDP per capita. Are our innovations leading to cleaner water for all, a healthier and complete diet for all, and meaningful employment for all?
91;Health Benefits of Local Government Sustainability Efforts: A Social Cognitive Perspective;Abstract Since climate change presents an unprecedented threat to public health, creating environmentally sustainable communi ties has become an important policy goal. Many local governments have voluntarily implemented sustainability practices to mitigate and adapt to climate change at community levels. Because of the potential benefits, scholars and practitioners are paying increasing attention to the sustainability practices of local government. This study provides evidence for their health benefits after analyzing data of more than 3000 older adults between 2012 and 2016. Our findings suggest that home weatherization assistance programs are associated with an increased likelihood that older adults will view life expectancy optimistically. Moreover, installing charging stations for electric vehicles is associated with increased physical activities. Our findings have important implications for local governments by linking climate change and community health issues.
92;Russian companies uneven on environmental adaptation;Significance  The global shift towards decarbonisation threatens Russian exports and public revenue, and the more aware mining and other companies are paying greater attention to environmental, social and governance (ESG) issues. A warming climate and increasingly frequent natural disasters raise costs and liabilities for companies and the state, while pollution will undermine public health and life expectancy.       Impacts  Government ministries must submit plans to adapt to climate change by December for inclusion in the 2022-24 budget.   Climate change offers an area for political collaboration with the United States.   Russia will push for recognition of its forest absorption capacity and of nuclear energy as 'green'.   Moscow will promote its plentiful natural gas reserves as the optimum transition-period fuel source.  Several green projects will undergo pilot testing next year, including hydrogen production and an emissions trading scheme in Sakhalin.
93;Democratic institutions and the energy intensity of well-being: a cross-national study;BackgroundEnergy consumption is necessary for human well-being, yet the growth of energy consumption also contributes to climate change and a range of negative externalities. Thus, a key sustainability challenge is to efficiently use energy consumption to promote human well-being. This manuscript contributes to the growing literature on the ecological intensity of well-being (EIWB) by modeling the relationship between democratic institutions and the energy intensity of well-being.MethodsWe use international data to understand how democratic institutions—understood as a combination of elected legislature, elected executives, and democratic competition—impact the energy intensity of well-being. The energy intensity of well-being is an adjusted ratio of energy consumption and life expectancy. We combine random-intercept mixed-effect models with entropy balancing constraints to create covariate balance between democracies and non-democracies.ResultsContrary to our expectations, we find that consistently null results suggesting that democracies do not leverage their energy consumption to improve well-being more effectively than other systems of government. Democracy and its subcomponents do not appear to improve, or reduce, the energy intensity of well-being.ConclusionsDemocracy does not appear to improve sustainability, operationalized as the energy intensity of well-being. On the other hand, democracies do not appear to do worse than non-democracies, suggesting democratization can spread without reducing sustainability.
94;Can You be Biologically Younger than Your Chronological Age? An Overview of Biological Ageing;The ageing of the population is rapidly escalating worldwide irrespective of unpredictable health challenges like climate change, emerging infectious disease, a microbe that develops drug resistance. India is also experiencing rapid socioeconomic progress and urbanization and the result of this demographic transition is population ageing. Even though there is an increase in life expectancy, there is no increase in health span, and thus increased life expectancy leads to ‘expansion of morbidity'. Longer life expectancy with the expansion of morbidity could enforce a challenge to geroscience as well as a substantial health burden and a threat to the national economy.   In normal ageing, chronological age equates to biological age but certain disease conditions accelerate biological age. Similarly, intervention with physical activity, anti-ageing nutraceuticals would slow down the rate ageing process and provide powerful benefits for longevity. The current review article is based on MeSH and free-text terms in databases such as PubMed, the Cochrane Library, and Science Direct.  This article aims to provide an overview of the concept of biological ageing with emphasis on the pathophysiology of ageing, quantification of biological ageing and the anti-ageing strategies.
95;What the patient wants: Addressing patients’ treatment targets in an integrative group psychotherapy programme;OBJECTIVES Limited empirical attention has been devoted to individualized treatment objectives in intensive group therapy for personality dysfunction. This study investigated patients' ratings of distress associated with individual therapy goals - referred to as target object severity - in an intensive Evening Treatment Programme for patients with personality dysfunction.   DESIGN Change in target objective severity was examined in a sample of 81 patients who completed treatment in an intensive, integrative group therapy programme.   METHODS Correlation and regression analyses were used to examine associations between change in target object severity and patients' pre-treatment diagnosis, symptom distress, and treatment outcome expectancy, and between change in target objective severity and patients' ratings of group therapy process (group climate, therapeutic alliance, group cohesion). The relationship between change in target objective severity and longer-range life satisfaction was also examined in a subsample of patients who rated life satisfaction at follow-up.   RESULTS While change in target objective severity was not significantly related to pre-treatment variables, significant associations were found with several aspects of group therapy process. Patients' experience of a highly engaged group climate was uniquely associated with improvement in target object severity. Such improvement was significantly related to longer-term life satisfaction after controlling for general symptom change.   CONCLUSION The working atmosphere in group therapy contributes to patients' progress regarding individual treatment targets, and such progress is an important factor in later satisfaction. Attention to individualized treatment targets deserves further clinical and research attention in the context of integrative group therapy for personality dysfunction.   PRACTITIONER POINTS This study found that patients attending an integrative group treatment programme for personality dysfunction experienced significant improvement in severity of distress related to individual treatment objectives. Improvement in severity of distress related to individual treatment objectives was uniquely associated with patients' experience of an engaged, collaborative working atmosphere. Improvement in individual target objective severity was associated with patients' ratings of overall life satisfaction, rated an average of 9 months following termination, after controlling for change in general symptom severity.
96;Health Concerns in Urban Slums: A Glimpse of Things to Come?;Bangladesh, with a population of 167 million, has recently emerged from being classified as a low-income country to a low-middle-income country and has made some progress in poverty reduction. However, in Bangladesh, mortality among children younger than 5 years is 33 per 1000 live births, life expectancy at birth is 72 years, and the most common causes of premature death are neonatal disorders and stroke.1 The annual per capita income is US $1316, with approximately 15% of the population living in extreme poverty.1 Dhaka, the capital, has a population of more than 20 million and is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Dhaka is also considered one of the most environmentally contaminated cities in the world, yet for some of the increasing population of rural poor, it is a highly attractive place to live. For those living in rural areas, available land is decreasing because of overpopulation and climate change, and for some, the ground water is contaminated with arsenic. Given the struggles in their lives, people come to Dhaka by the thousands each week. With limited education, skills, and financial resources, most of these migrants end up living in a slum. Is this a glimpse of things to come in resource-limited countries?
97;"Anthropocene, the challenge for ""Homo sapiens"" to set its own limits";The Anthropocene as a distinct geological era has been the subject of active discussion within the scientific community. This era includes the notion that Homo sapiens has had a large impact on global planetary processes. Here, we aim at connecting the notion and nature of the Anthropocene with the social-economic success and the unexpected or unplanned environmental impacts of the anthropogenic activity. Some of the main achievements along the history of humankind have been important developmental steps for many human civilisations but they have also had undesired results that we could not foresee, including the rise of greenhouse gases emissions, the shifts in the area of species distributions or the affection of all major biogeochemical cycles. Increasing human life expectancy and health has promoted an exponential population growth, which together with the increased environmental footprint per capita has pushed many core variables for Earth functioning (e.g. biodiversity, nitrogen cycle, climate change) out of their safety limits. We illustrate examples of many ecosystems that have collapsed around the world because we have crossed the limits of their sustainable exploitation. Paradoxically, it is humanity itself who is pushing the Planet to conditions in which our own survival will unlikely be possible. The reason behind such a strong ecological and functional impact on the Planet within a relatively short space of time is an unsustainable economic system based on the assumption that a perpetual economic growth is not only possible but also desirable. Our awakening should lie on a global framework aimed at changing our relationship with the Planet.
98;Employment in the age group 50+ in the Baltic states and its changes in response to COVID-19;The objective of the study is to examine the patterns of the employment of older people in Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania over the recent decade and the changes brought about by the first wave coronavirus pandemic in spring 2020. The study is based on the Eurostat statistical data as well as the microdata from the recent wave of the Survey of Health, Ageing and Retirement (SHARE). Particular attention is paid to the data collected in SHARE Wave 8 COVID-19 Survey conducted in June-August 2020 in 26 European countries and Israel via computer-assisted telephone interviews. Questions examined how people aged 50 years and older coped with socioeconomic and health-related impact of COVID-19. During the last decade, participation of older age groups in labour market is gradually growing with the increase of the statutory retirement age and life expectancy. Employment rates in the pre-retirement and post-retirement age groups are comparatively high in Latvia and other Baltic States as contrasted to the EU averages, especially among women. Despite of relatively worse health status, people in the Baltic countries also demonstrate the highest share of respondents with willingness to work even upon reaching pension age. In 2020, the COVID-19 had relatively mild impact on it. The branches with traditionally high share of workers aged 50+ (education, healthcare, agriculture, administrative services) were least affected by lockdown measures.
99;A Deeper Union: From a Failed Project to the European Quality Lead;After President Trump’s departure, many expected that the transatlantic partnership would return to its previous state with the US playing a leading role. This article challenges that view. Instead, a new world order is foreseen, with different partnerships and spheres of influence. Europe can decide whether it wants to remain small and homogeneous or a larger but also more heterogenous Union that leads in welfare indicators such as life expectancy, fighting poverty and limiting climate change. Expanding this lead and communicating its uniqueness can empower Europe to combine enlargement and deepening, which appears unlikely without changes in governance and self-confidence.
100;Environmental health in Australia: overlooked and underrated;Abstract Improvements in environmental health have had the most significant impact on health status. In Australia, life expectancy has significantly increased through provision of vaccination, safe food and drinking water, appropriate sewage disposal and other environmental health measures. Yet the profession that is instrumental in delivering environmental health services at the local community level is overlooked. Rarely featuring in mainstream media, the successes of Environmental Health Officers (EHOs) are invisible to the general public. As a consequence, students entering university are unaware of the profession and its significant role in society. This has resulted in there being too few EHOs to meet the current regulatory requirements, much less deal with the emerging environmental health issues arising as a consequence of changing global conditions including climate change. To futureproof Australian society and public health this workforce issue, and the associated oversight of environmental health must be addressed now.
101;Evolution of External Health Costs of Electricity Generation in the Baltic States;Implementation of strict policies for mitigating climate change has a direct impact on public health as far as the external health costs of electricity generation can be reduced, thanks to the reduction of emission of typical pollutants by switching to cleaner low carbon fuels and achieving energy efficiency improvements. Renewables have lower external health costs due to the lower life cycle emission of typical air pollutants linked to electricity generation, such as SO2, NOx, particulate matter, NH3, or NMVOC (Non-methane volatile organic compounds), which all appear to have serious negative effects on human health. Our case study performed in the Baltic States analyzed the dynamics of external health costs in parallel with the dynamics of the main health indicators in these countries: life expectancy at birth, mortality rates, healthy life years, self-perceived health, and illness indicators. We employed the data for external health costs retrieved from the CASES database, as well as the health statistics data compiled from the EUROSTAT database. The time range of the study was 2010–2018 due to the availability of consistent health indicators for the EU Member States. Our results show that the decrease of external health costs had a positive impact on the increase of the self-perceived good health and reduction of long-standing illness as well as the decrease of infant death rate. Our conclusions might be useful for other countries as well as for understanding the additional benefits of climate change mitigation policies and tracking their positive health impacts. The cooperation initiatives on clean energy and climate change mitigation between countries like One Belt One Road initiative by the Chinese government can also yield additional benefits linked to the public health improvements.
102;Genetic Improvement of Oilseed Crops Using Modern Biotechnology;In 2009, big challenges facing the agricultural sector in the twenty-first century were presented to the world. Human population growth, increased life expectancy, loss of biodiversity, climate change and accelerated land degradation are the main factors con- tributing to rethink agriculture system production. In that scenery, modern biotechnology has set a stage for the advancement of agricultural practices and it is clearly an important ally to apply a broad array of technologies and innovative systems where they are most needed, such as enhancing crop productivity, increasing yields, and ultimately ensuring food security. One of the biggest challenges is related to technify production systems, but with no doubt, developing genetic improvement toward getting an efficient and sus - tainable agriculture, generating new seed qualities (new traits), such as, among others, to upset fatty acids content in oilseed crops have been growing up significantly due to industry interest. In this study, a review about the main advances in genetic improvement of some oilseed crops, starting with omics to understand metabolic routes and to find out key genes in seed oil production, and also, getting in use of modern biotechnology to alter the production of fatty acids, and to face biotic challenges in oilseed crops is presented. plants. nodes using Agrobacterium rhizogenes , placed under a 35S-35S promoter (a variant of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35S promoter with higher transcriptional activity) to drive transgenic expression, into pBin438 vector with kanamycin resistance gene (for bacterial selection) and the hygromycin phosphotransferase gene (for plant transformation selection). These authors demonstrated that canola FCA-RRM2 increases plant size, organ size, cell size, plant productivity and oil content. According to the author of that research, these results provide a practical approach for the genetic improvement of this plant.
103;In the March 2021 Issue of the Quarterly.;Since the launch of the Quarterly’s Building Back Better series of policy opinion posts in November 2020, the United States has experienced one of the most tumultuous and traumatic periods in its history. In fact, the entire year of 2020 will be remembered as a “perfect storm” of global pandemic, tragically avoidable death, reduced life expectancy, economic depression, racial injustice, and civil unrest. Fortunately, the violent insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, failed, and the inauguration of President Biden occurred two weeks later without incident. Since taking office, the Biden administration has initiated a host of federal policy changes affecting not only health but other areas of policy that relate to health, most notably environmental protection and climate change. Some of these policy shifts reverse Trump-era policies harmful to health, while others aim to improve or strengthen existing programs. Not surprisingly, many have aligned closely with ideas and recommendations contained in the 13 pieces posted thus far in the Building Back Better series. Because the administration continues to face formidable challenges that require timely, practical, evidence-based policy advice, we will continue the series for the foreseeable future and invite readers to visit our website (https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/ building-back-better/). The four Perspectives in this issue of the Quarterly all embrace the spirit of “building back better.” In “Population Health Science: Fulfilling the Mission of Public Health,” Frederick Zimmerman argues that public health has been distracted from its historical mission of ensuring the conditions in which people can be healthy. He attributes this to a heavy reliance on randomized controlled trials, a dearth of formal theoretical models, and a reluctance to engage in politics. However, he believes that the field of population health is bringing needed scientific tools to the aid of public health in fulfilling its core mission. Persistent communication inequities have limited the access of racial and ethnic minorities to life-saving health information, making them more vulnerable to the harmful effects of misinformation. In “The Com-
104;Resilient design of landslip prevention measures: a case study;Bervie Braes is a 750 m long, and up to 55 m high, coastal slope above a residential area and harbour in Stonehaven, Scotland, with a history of instability mostly associated with the road traversing the slope. This paper outlines the most probable causes of the instability on the slope and details the hazards that had to be taken into account during the design and construction of stabilisation measures. The hazards associated with hydrology in terms of future potential change in rainfall patterns and intensity, but also in terms of providing adequate drainage capacity and flows, were juxtaposed against the geotechnical hazards of shallow landslips and erosion near the surface, as well as deep-seated landslides on the slope. Owing to the complex nature of the hazards and the need for longer life expectancy of the design, the soil nailing option was combined with eco-engineering strategies to provide resilience for a changing climate. A risk-based approach considering the number of lives at danger during a...
105;The Impact of Economic Growth in Mortality Modelling for Selected OECD Countries;The health of a population is affected by social, environmental, and economic factors. Pension providers and consultants, insurance companies, government agencies and individuals in the developed world have a vested interest in understanding how the economic growth will impact on the life expectancy of their population. Therefore, changes in death rates may occur due to climate and economic changes. In this study, we extend a previous study into excess deaths as a result of climate change to also provide a comprehensive investigation of the impact of economic changes using annual female and male data for 5 developed OECD countries. We find that there is strong negative relationship between mortality index, and climate and economic proxies. This model shows to provide better fitting and forecasting results both for females and males, and for all countries studied.
106;The health of Arctic populations: Does cold matter?;The objective of the study was to examine whether cold climate is associated with poorer health in diverse Arctic populations. With climate change increasingly affecting the Arctic, the association between climate and population health status is of public health significance. The mean January and July temperatures were determined for 27 Arctic regions based on weather station data for the period 1961–1990 and their association with a variety of health outcomes assessed by correlation and multiple linear regression analyses. Mean January temperature was inversely associated with infant and perinatal mortality rate, age‐standardized mortality rate from respiratory diseases, and age‐specific fertility rate for teens and directly associated with life expectancy at birth in both males and females, independent of a variety of socioeconomic, demographic, and health care factors. Mean July temperature was also associated with infant mortality and mortality from respiratory diseases, and with total fertility rate. For every 10°C increase in mean January temperature, the life expectancy at birth among males increased by about 6 years and infant mortality rate decreased by about 4 deaths/1,000 livebirths. Cold climate is significantly associated with higher mortality and fertility in Arctic populations and should be recognized in public health planning. Am. J. Hum. Biol., 2010. © 2009 Wiley‐Liss, Inc.
107;Indigenous Forests Protect Life, Heart and Genes;We now enjoy an affluent, comfortable and efficient lifestyle that human beings have long dreamt of. And yet we feel lurking anxiety about the present and the future. Some youths do not have any definite aim in life or foresight, and some people are alarmed by nature destruction, environmental pollution, erratic climate change, global warming and so on.  When it comes to medical care, there are serious shortages of physicians in rural areas and in specific departments such as obstetrics and gynecology and pediatrics. The average life expectancy of Japanese has increased, but various forms of disease including cancer and dementia debase the quality of life.  Affluent urban life today is supported by the countryside, which undertakes foodproduction and preserves the natural environment. The government should make more efforts to correct disparities between urban and rural areas in population, economics, culture, and medical care.  We live now at a crossroads in the 4-billion-year long history of life on the earth. The thread of genes has continued to the pressent. It must be handed down to posterity. Advances in medical technology have contribute greatly to the protection of our life and genes. Indigenous forests have unsophisticatedly fostered our health, physical and mental, soul, and have protected our genes.  We humans and other animals alike are consumers in the ecosystems on the earth. Greenplants are the only producers, and bacteria and fungi are decomposers. Green plants, especially multi-layered native forests that enrich green plants, are the very foundation of human existence.  Japanese were particularly zealous in protecting and bequeathing native forests in each community, and reforesting after destroying forests to construct paddy fields, roads and villages just as other peoples did in other partsof the world.  Native forests in most areas of Japan are laurel forests. Main tree species of laurel forests have evergreen thick watery leaves and deep taproots grabbing thesoil. So, multi-layered native forests have the function of environmental protection including noise insulation, windbreaking, air and water purification, and water retention, as well as the function of disaster mitigation, minimizing damage from storms, earthquakes, fires and tsunamis.  Forests absorb CO2 in the air through photosynthesis and fix carbon as an organic compound in the tree body. This helps curb global warming. In the age of deteriorating biodiversity, it is worthy of special mention that there are so many tree species and so many species of birds, insects and small animals in an indigenous forest as well as bacteria and fungi living in the soil. Thus, indigenous forests maintain rich biodiversity, and are the real green environments that protect our life, heart and genes.  However, indigenous forests are rapidly vanishing from almost all the areas of the world. Where native forests still remain, they should be preserved. Where native forests are destroyed, they should be restored and regenerated by all possible mean. We conduct phytosociological field surveys to determine main tree species of a given district, nurse their potted seedlings until theroot system fully develops in the containers, and plant them mixed and densely with local citizens. In this ecological plantation survival rate is good, and seedlings grow steadily to form a quasi-natural forest in 10-15 years.  Every one of us should plant seedlings for ecological reforestation here and now, especially around hospitals and clinics, and spread the reforestation movement to the whole world to protect our own life, heart and genes.
108;Incorporating natural ecosystems into global health and food security programmes;"Natural ecosystems such as forests, coral reefs, mangroves and grasslands provide essential goods and services that support human health and food security. Examples of these ecosystem services include crop pollination by wild pollinators, regulation of water flow by mangroves and provision of wild foods and natural medicines by forests. Globally, ecosystem degradation due to deforestation, overharvesting, pollution, poorly planned infrastructure projects, climate change, urbanization and other threats compromises ecosystem function and disrupts the flow of ecosystem services. The Rockefeller Foundation-Lancet Commission on Planetary Health noted that negative environmental trends pose serious threats to the global health gains of the past decades.1 The Commission highlights environmental degradation as a major issue that could reverse many of the development advances made in recent decades such as increased life expectancy, decreased child mortality and lower rates of extreme poverty. Mechanisms through which global environmental change affects human health and food security include variations in the availability and quality of food, water and natural medicines; changes in the exposure to zoonotic, vectorborne and other infectious pathogens, as illustrated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, as well as alterations in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Incorporating natural ecosystems into global health and food security programmes can help meet the goals of the health and food security sectors while contributing to the improved management and sustainability of ecosystems and the important services they provide. Here we suggest three practical ways in which natural ecosystems can be incorporated into global health and food security programmes to achieve these goals more sustainably and ensure that ecosystem degradation does not undermine previous achievements in these sectors. These suggestions will be most useful for international development donors, programme managers and technical specialists who fund and implement global health and food security programmes. We link each suggestion with a summary of the relevant evidence that supports it and specific types of actions to implement the suggestions. First, ecosystem-related questions should be included in household surveys, as appropriate. Many global health and food security programmes conduct household surveys throughout project implementation. Incorporating relevant survey questions can help advance understanding of the ecosystem goods and services that target households rely on, of perceived changes to the availability of these goods and services, and of how household reliance on local ecosystems varies based on socioeconomic status, gender and other factors, among other topics. A growing body of research demonstrates the many different ways that households benefit from natural ecosystems. For example, an analysis conducted in 2016 involving 7975 households in 24 tropical countries found that over three-quarters of study households harvested wild foods from local ecosystems for subsistence and sale.2 Wild foods are often rich in micronutrients, supplement carbohydrate-rich diets common in many low-income countries, and can be an important source of income for poorer households and those experiencing shocks.2,3 A global analysis found that many foods like pumpkin, mango and melon that are rich in micronutrients including vitamin A, iron and folic acid require animal pollinators for production.4 Natural ecosystems also provide medicinal plants for use in traditional medicine; an estimated 80% of people in low-income countries rely on traditional medicine to treat various ailments such as infections, inflammation and cardiovascular disease.5 Examples of ecosystem-related survey questions that reflect the current state of the evidence could focus on household use of wild foods such as fish, insects, meat, fruits and vegetables; use of wild foods during times of shock or crisis; and changes in the availability of wild foods due to local environmental change. Other potential topics to explore through survey questions include the status of local pollinator populations on household farms and the effects of local environmental change on crop productivity and the availability of medicinal plants. These types of questions, incorporated within the surveys and tailored to the local context, provide valuable information that can help guide activities aimed at sustaining the natural resource base and its contributions to health and food security. Second, efforts to improve ecosystem management should be supported. The global health and food security sectors can support a range of activities that strengthen the natural resource base critical to optimizing the effectiveness and sustainability of their programmes. Scientific consensus that the earth’s natural ecosystems have entered an unprecedented era of degradation, raising concerns about their ability to continue providing ecosystem services, is increasing. A growing body of evidence demonstrates linkages between natural ecosystems and global health and food security priorities, such as decreasing Incorporating natural ecosystems into global health and food security programmes Anila Jacob, Kiersten Johnson, Robert Cohen & Sara E Carlson"
109;OP86 Low economic growth, health, health inequalities and sustainable development goals in a rich country: 27-year Japanese time series;Background Sustainable Development Goal #8 refers to decent work and economic growth. In the context of climate change and global resource depletion, it is important to understand whether low economic growth is compatible with positive population health in rich countries, particularly because the past decade of austerity in the UK and USA is associated with stagnating life expectancy. Japan provides a natural experiment in that it has experienced low economic growth since 1992, and life expectancy continued to improve. However, the trend in health inequality in good self-rated health is unknown. Methods We examined trends in health and health inequalities using ten triennial waves of a nationally representative survey in Japan, 1986–2013 (n=731,647). Change in age-standardized self-rated good health was calculated, and health inequalities and their time trends were calculated using Slope and Relative Indices of Inequality (SII and RII respectively) in relation to net household income. Analyses were stratified by sex and age, for children (6–18 years), working-age adults (20–59 years), younger old (60–69 years) and older old (70–79 years), given age differences in relation to the economy and labour market. Time trends of SII and RII were tested during the period of economic stagnation 1992–2013. Results Overall, age-standardised self-rated good health was high among children (70%) and low among the older old (30%). In all age groups, prevalence of good health declined slightly from its peak in 1995 but increased after 2007. In 1992 among children, working-age adults and younger old, health inequality based on SII for net household income was small (approximately 10% lower prevalence of good health in those with lowest compared to highest income). Among working-age adults, time trends of health inequalities between 1992 and 2013 were curvilinear. The SII narrowed and then widened after 2002 (quadratic trends in men and women p Conclusion The long-term low-growth Japanese economy appears compatible with maintaining and improving population health and holding health inequalities at current levels. This evidence is of great significance for sustainable development and the health of current and future generations.
110;The Green Revolution for Oil&Gas Using Battery-Less NB-IoT IIoT Devices Powered by Waste Heat for Process Maintenance;Our planet has a tremendous problem with the air pollution and climate change. The last study published by Jos Lelieveld et al. [1] remarks the high exposition risk of EU Citizens to suffer cardiovascular diseases due to our poisonous air quality, killing yearly 800.000 EU citizens and reducing 2.2 years our life expectancy. Additionally, the last report presented on the UN conference for climate change on 25th of September'19, the IPPC, sets that if the water temperature increases 2°C, the sea level will rise 42cm from this year to 2100 but. If it increases 3°C, the rise will be 84 cm.  Besides, it has been demonstrated that the carbon footprint associated with various human activities leads to a steady increase in global mean temperature. Most of the gases that human activity emits into the atmosphere are due to the industrial processes that require a lot of energy for the transformation of the raw materials. Furthermore, a large part of the energy consumed in the industry is dissipated in the form of heat, also called waste heat. As a clear example, in the EU27, it is estimated that more than 65% of the energy used in the energy-intensive industries (EII) industry is lost in form of waste heat, representing yearly the 21% the EU energy needs.  This paper presents new wireless and battery-less industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) devices powered by waste heat for measuring vibrations in rotative machines, called INDUEYE IIoT. These self-powered devices will help huge energy demanding industries (especially chemical, petrochemical, oil refineries, etc.) to become more environmentally friendly and profitable in their digitalization process towards Industry 4.0. Also, these new industrial sensing devices take benefit of the new long-range wireless protocols such as NB-IoT or LoRa that simply eliminate all the wireless infrastructure in the facility (and its associated costs). Additionally, the edge-computing concept is introduced in the INDUEYE IIoT device decreasing to 98% of the cloud computation, reducing in consequence, the cloud computing carbon footprint, and its associated fees.
111;Emerging health issues: the widening challenge for population health promotion.;"The spectrum of tasks for health promotion has widened since the Ottawa Charter was signed. In 1986, infectious diseases still seemed in retreat, the potential extent of HIV/AIDS was unrecognized, the Green Revolution was at its height and global poverty appeared less intractable. Global climate change had not yet emerged as a major threat to development and health. Most economists forecast continuous improvement, and chronic diseases were broadly anticipated as the next major health issue. Today, although many broadly averaged measures of population health have improved, many of the determinants of global health have faltered. Many infectious diseases have emerged; others have unexpectedly reappeared. Reasons include urban crowding, environmental changes, altered sexual relations, intensified food production and increased mobility and trade. Foremost, however, is the persistence of poverty and the exacerbation of regional and global inequality. Life expectancy has unexpectedly declined in several countries. Rather than being a faint echo from an earlier time of hardship, these declines could signify the future. Relatedly, the demographic and epidemiological transitions have faltered. In some regions, declining fertility has overshot that needed for optimal age structure, whereas elsewhere mortality increases have reduced population growth rates, despite continuing high fertility. Few, if any, Millennium Development Goals (MDG), including those for health and sustainability, seem achievable. Policy-makers generally misunderstand the link between environmental sustainability (MDG #7) and health. Many health workers also fail to realize that social cohesion and sustainability--maintenance of the Earth's ecological and geophysical systems--is a necessary basis for health. In sum, these issues present an enormous challenge to health. Health promotion must address population health influences that transcend national boundaries and generations and engage with the development, human rights and environmental movements. The big task is to promote sustainable environmental and social conditions that bring enduring and equitable health gains."
112;Modern Biotechnology for Agricultural Development in Colombia;Colombia is currently one of the most promising countries with regard to its potential for agricultural development and for generating food supply for current and future human generations. This is owing to factors such as availability of land, water, topographical diversity, as well as political factors. Nevertheless, Colombia will reach this full potential if it adopts available technologies that can meet the current global challenges faced by the agriculture in the 21st century: among others, world population growth, increase in average life expectancy, high degree of malnutrition, climate change, wrong agricultural practices. Here is presented how modern biotechnology is an important ally as a wide range of technologies and innovative systems can be applied where they are most needed: for increasing cultivation productivity, resisting both biotic and abiotic factors, and ensuring food safety. In this study is showed evidence with regard to significant benefits of adopting biotechnological crops to contribute to food safety and how they are already being implemented in both developed and developing countries. Using modern technology, there are open opportunities for the country in search of circular bio-based economy, strengthen its food sovereignty and to serve as an agricultural breadbasket to Latin America and the World.
113;Developing emission models for fugitive particulate matter in arid and semi-arid regions;There is substantial evidence that airborne particulate matter (PM) contributes to haze, acid rain, global climate change, and decreased life expectancy. Many recent studies have reported that a large fraction of airborne PM could be attributed to fugitive PM (fPM). The developing arid and semi-arid regions, in particular, are facing the biggest brunt of fPM usually ascribed to the regionally transported dust. On the other hand, the rapid expansion of their metropolitan cities is contributing a considerable amount of locally induced fPM which makes it a prominent environmental and health stressor in these areas. Based on field measurements and dispersion modelling, this thesis aims to: (i) measure fPM from two common sources (loose soils and non-exhaust traffic) in areas with arid desert climates, (ii) derive representative emission models, and (iii) assess their overall environmental and health impacts.  For this thesis, on site measurements and samples of PM (<10 µm diameter) were collected. Source apportionment was performed to determine the contributions of individual sources. Dispersion modelling and regression analysis were used to derive emission models for loose Calcisols (a prominent soil in the subject areas) and vehicle-induced fPM (VfPM). Finally, our derived models were used along with the state-of-the-art practices (i.e., regional emission models and the World Health Organization’s (WHO) Environmental Burden of Disease (EBD) method) to determine the environmental and health impacts of local fPM. Several important findings were extracted from the above analysis: (i) fPM from different origins contribute more than 60% of the urban PM in arid areas, (ii) power law emission models with wind speed dependence were derived for loose Calcisols soil, (iii) emission factors were derived for VfPM using linear regression and were close to values reported in USA, (iv) EBD estimates found that fPM may lead to ~ 11.0 times higher short-term excess mortalities compared to constant database measurements.
114;The kids aren’t alright;"<p>Will a new-born experience more impacts from climate change compared to a 60-year old? While the obvious answer to this question is yes, impacts accumulated across an average person&#8217;s lifetime have so far not been quantified. Providing such information is however relevant and timely, given the recent surge in societal debate regarding inter-generational solidarity and considering ongoing climate litigation. Here we combine multi-model impact projections from the Inter-Sectoral Impact Model Intercomparison Project (ISIMIP) with temperature trajectories from the IPCC special report on warming of 1.5&#176;C and life expectancy data from the World Bank to compute accumulated impact exposure across lifetimes of people in different age groups and countries. We consider six impacts categories (droughts, heatwaves, tropical cyclones, crop failure, floods, and wildfires), for which ISIMIP provides a total of 170 impact projections with 15 different impact models under RCP2.6 and 6.0. Our results highlight that the combined increase in life expectancy and unfolding climate impacts leads to 2-4 times more impacts affecting a new-born compared to a 60-year old person under current policy pledges. Globally, the increase in exposure for young people is dominated by the strong increase in heatwave hazards. The strongest increases occur in low and lower-middle income countries, where rising impacts compound a substantial increase in life expectancy. Our results overall highlight the strong benefit of aligning policies with the Paris Agreement for safeguarding the future of current young generations.</p>"
115;A three year study on the soil water availability at roadside trees in Hamburg, Germany;"<p>The benefit of urban roadside trees to provide ecosystem services and wellbeing of human in expanding and compacted cities gets more and more attention. For northern Germany it is predicted that climate change rises summer temperatures and that precipitation patterns shift to drier vegetation periods. In cities, those impacts will intensify water (soil sealing) and heat problems (urban heat island) even more. Furthermore, roadside trees have to deal with several specific site limitations like extreme soil compaction and soil sealing, low water infiltration rates, sandy and anthropogenic deposited substrates, and soil volume restrictions. The consequences for the trees are drought stress combined with reduced vitality and life expectancy.</p><p>Our research is based on soil water monitoring at 17 roadside plantation sites across the city of Hamburg.&#160; We focus on the water availability of prepared planting soils and the development of the trees root systems. Sensors for soil water tension and soil temperature were installed in different soil areas of each site: topsoil, root ball, tree pit substrate, lateral space, and subsoil. The general goal of this study was to characterize the soil water availability at roadside planting pits during the first years after plantation (here: 2017, 2018 and 2019). Based on these results the long-term objective is to elaborate recommendations for the soil-related technology of future urban tree planting sites. The Creation of more suitable conditions in the planting site enhances roadside tree vitality and provides ecosystem services by the trees on a higher level.</p><p>The data analysis focused on two main aspects. First, the effect of weather conditions, especially &#160;the extreme wet and dry vegetation periods, on the soil water availability in the tree pit. Second, the three-year temporal development of soil water distribution in the different soil areas within the planting pitafter plantation.</p><p>We found that soil water availability in the vegetation period (VP; April-October) at the investigated roadside plantation sites are highly correlated to weather conditions (air temperature (aT) and precipitation (P)). During a cold and wet VP (aT: 14,0 &#176;C, P: 631 mm), soil tensions reached a critical value on average at 24 &#177; 18 days (11 &#177; 9 % of VP). In a hot and dry VP (aT: 16,0 &#176;C, P: 222 mm), soil tensions reached a critical value on average at 115 &#177; 22 days (54 &#177; 10 % of VP).</p><p>Furthermore, the results showed that soil water scarcity in the first VP occurred mainly in the root ball, whereas during the second VP water scarcity developed in all soil areas within the planting site, except for the subsoil. Although the amount of precipitation during the last vegetation period was more than doubled compared to the second, the subsoil reached higher water tensions. This finding leads to the conclusion that root development after plantation took place from the root ball over the prepared planting soil into the surrounding soil within depths of up to 1 m. &#160;</p>"
116;What can public health do about it? How public health projects and programs can be more sustainable;Our global society has evolved in the last century at an astonishing pace, with human population more than doubling in the last 50 years. Public Health has been largely influenced in a positive way by the social and technological advancements that lead to a decrease in child mortality and an increase in life expectancy. However, the accelerated pace of climate change and its predicted impact on population health is one of the greatest challenges the human species faces. There are many ways PH can contribute in that challenge, from legislative action and advocacy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and toxic waste on a global scale to small projects that tackle locally specific problems.        This presentation is part of a workshop on how individuals and public health (PH) can create a more sustainable world. It aims specifically to present examples and ideas of how to make current public health projects at a local level more sustainable.        Several examples will be discussed during the presentation, including the adherence to European directives, like reducing the amount of paper used in projects, and the focus on the environmental impacts of each program implemented, creating a mindset of “sustainability in all action”.        There seems to be a global concern about climate change, with many strategic documents and agreements outlining the path for a more sustainable world. However, there is also a clear difficulty in translating those strategies to action in our everyday Public Health practice. The changes referred during this presentation might not be directly related to the main goal of the project or program, yet they by contributing to climate action they will also contribute to population health gains.
117;Moving From Data to Action: Necessary Next Steps to a Better Governmental Public Health Workforce;We live in a time of unprecedented health transformation. Health disparities of all types (rural, age, race, and gender) are steady, if not increasing, and for the first time in US history, overall life expectancy is declining. Climate change, opioid misuse and addiction, integration of physical and behavioral health, and persistent rates of chronic disease are both contemporary and emerging public health problems. Tackling these problems from the governmental public health perspective requires a competent, adaptive, diverse, and engaged workforce. We cannot expect to achieve heath improvement in communities nationwide without strong public health agencies built on a foundation of well-trained and innovative public health practitioners. Building this foundation requires deliberate and thoughtful leadership, robust strategic thinking and implementation, and the resources needed to carry out public health’s comprehensive mission. There were no nationally representative data on the governmental public health agency workforce before 2014. National data that were available were collected at the agency level. While these surveys provided valuable insights into staffing levels, budget changes, and other important topics, they did not capture the beliefs, attitudes, opinions, and experiences of individual public health workers. Efforts to survey individual members of the governmental public health workforce were limited by differences in data collection methods, time frames, and questionnaire
118;The Dominance of Food Supply in Changing Demographic Factors across Africa: A Model Using a Systems Identification Approach;Demographic indicators linked to general health have been strongly linked to economic development. However, change in such indicators is also associated with other factors such as climate, water availability, and diet. Here, we use a systems modelling approach, bringing together a range of environmental, economic, dietary, and health factors, to seek possible dominant causes of demographic change across Africa. A continent-wide, north-south transect of countries allows for the exploration of a range of climates, while a longitudinal transect from the Atlantic to the Red Sea provides a range of socio-economic factors within the similar climatic regime of Sahelian Africa. While change in national life expectancy and death rate since 1960 is modelled to be linked to a varying number and type of factors across the transects, the dominant factor in improving these demographic indicators across the continent is food availability. This has been strongly modulated by HIV infection rates in recent decades in some countries.
119;Towards Sustainable Urban Development: the Ukrainian situation;"Abstract The continuing process of urbanization sets up urgent issues of environmental degradation resulting in disrupting opportunities to enhance quality of life of the population. In Ukraine, the anthropogenic and human impacts on the environment are several times higher than in developed countries. Thus, life expectancy in Ukraine is on average around 68 years (e.g. in Italy – 82, Sweden - 80, Poland - 74) which is largely due to the environmental pollution which is the result of production activities of mining, metallurgy, chemical industries, fuel and energy complex. Therefore, there is a strong need in the Ukrainian society to address the consequences of powerful external forces as environmental pollution and climate change, and internal forces as socioeconomic development. These forces play a role at all levels but are prevalent at urban levels. Cities are not isolated entities; they interact with their surroundings, economically, socio-politically and environmentally. Urban development toward sustainability has to consider the capacity of the entire ecosystem to support such development including the prevention and mitigation of adverse environmental impacts of the outside urban areas. Hence, cities are unique territories to implement green economy opportunities to ensure the development of sustainable societies. Exploring different dimensions of sustainability should be connected with the exploration of urban processes and developments on a global level. This connection shows how sustainability can be destroyed or ensured. Sustainability should be based on social cohesion in local urban areas and contribute to sustainable urban development."
120;The local importance of global infectious diseases;Dengue in Tokyo and Key West. Leishmaniasis in Madrid and Texas. Chikungunya in Ravenna and Puerto Rico. SARS in Toronto. Ebola in Dallas. And measles everywhere. Population growth, globalization, climate change and urbanization together are reshaping the context upon which we must consider the global spread of emerging and historically tropical infectious diseases and their interface with non-communicable diseases of transitioning societies. We live on a crowded and interconnected planet, with a projected global human population of at least 9 billion by 2050 [1]. Public health advances such as safe water, adequate sanitation, antibiotics, vaccines and balanced nutrition programs have extended overall life expectancy, even in remote, under-developed settings. The resulting unprecedented population surge has contributed to numerous challenges that will increasingly serve as counter-balances to these public health advances and will synergize with other inter-related factors such globalization, climate change and urbanization to contribute to the spread of dangerous infectious diseases. International travel and immigration increase each year, with more than 1 billion humans crossing international borders in 2013 alone [2]. Many cross to embrace economic opportunities or to escape war or disaster. Many also travel to visit family or friends, or for business, education or leisure purposes. Exotic, remote and dangerous locations—often lacking public health infrastructure—are increasingly common destinations for travelers as well as sources of immigrants to the developed world. This “smaller world” effect brings with it much good in terms of societal connectedness and economic stimulation, but also individual risk to the traveler and the opportunity for spread of disease upon return. Our current age of globalization also involves the increasingly rapid and direct transportation of food and
121;Introduction to ICCS/ESCCA Consensus Guidelines to Detect GPI‐Deficient Cells in Paroxysmal Nocturnal Hemoglobinuria and Related Disorders;Since the seminal discoveries of the relationship between the underlying genetic mutation and the altered expression of GPI-linked antigen expression that underlies the pathobiology of paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH), flow cytometry and the immunophenotypic detection of PNH clones has played an increasingly important role in the diagnosis, monitoring, and clinical management of patients with PNH (1–3). With the successful introduction of complement blockade therapies for PNH (4), the condition has changed from one with a poor outcome (5) to one where life expectancy matches that of the normal population (6). With complement blockade therapies well established for PNH, and more alternatives on the horizon, diagnosis of PNH and monitoring of treatment efficacy has never been more important, given the particularly high cost of therapy. Since the publication in 2010 of the International Clinical Cytometry Society (ICCS) Consensus Guidelines for detection of PNH by flow cytometry (7), a significant “climate change” in the provenance of clinical flow cytometry testing in general has occurred. Contemporary guidelines are now driven by the expectations that clinical flow cytometry laboratories will work to ISO15189 standards or National Regulatory requirements that require documented validation of all tests offered. Furthermore, regulatory bodies and other stakeholders now require validation of methods used for clinical trials where flow cytometry methods are used for diagnosis, to monitor responses to therapy, or define clinical endpoints. On this background of accreditation and validation, professional societies such as ICCS and ESCCA are now actively enlisting expertise to produce practical guidelines that address all aspects of clinical flow cytometry assays. In this edition of Clinical Cytometry, four articles are presented that provide an updated and significantly improved comprehensive practical guide to PNH testing. In the first of these, Dezern and Borowitz (8) present a detailed account of the role of PNH testing and how it contributes to the diagnosis, classification, and monitoring of patients. When interpreted correctly, the results from PNH flow cytometry testing, including presence and size of the clonal populations and the cell types involved, can allow the clinician to classify the disease appropriately, evaluate the risk of disease progression, and subsequently monitor response to therapy. The second section of these updated ICCS PNH Consensus Guidelines concentrates on specific instrument setup for PNH assays, together with the identification and testing of appropriate antibody conjugates (9). Assay design is also covered in great detail and underlines principles that can be transferred to other immunophenotyping procedures. In part 3, Illingworth et al. offer practical guidance on the analysis and reporting of PNH results using a fully optimized assay (10). They also address the most common analytical challenges for accurate reporting of results. Furthermore, the authors supply an extensive case library to assist in the interpretation of more difficult cases, drawn from their many years of experience. In the final section, Oldaker et al. not only provide a comprehensive guide on how to validate the flow cytometric procedures described in parts 2 and 3, but also detail the differences between cell-based and traditional soluble analyte assay validations (11). The procedures described are based on the recommendations of a number of stakeholders who provide external guidance and general recommendations together with the published experience of experts in the area of PNH testing. The overall goal is to provide practical assay-specific guidelines for the validation of high-sensitivity flow cytometric PNH assays. For clinical laboratories it is important recognize that the ultimate beneficiary of the complex process of assay development, optimization, and validation processes has to be the patient. For a rare disease such as PNH, diagnostic testing with the knowledge that an assay has been through a comprehensive validation process is critically important. When a new diagnosis of PNH is made this can have life changing and potentially lifelong implications for individual patients. These updated and comprehensive guidelines for PNH testing are the result of many hours of dedication from all contributors. Specific thanks have to go to Andrea Illingworth and Rob Sutherland who have

In 2015, the United Nations Development Program ranked Chad 185 out of 188 countries on the Human Development Index.1 Most of the approximately 14.5 million Chadians live in extreme poverty and deprivation; absolute poverty is expected to rise from 4.7 million people in 2012 to 6.3 million people in 2019.1 The life expectancy in Chad is just 51 years. Chad also suffers from so-called desertification from climate change, with large areas of dry land becoming increasingly arid, particularly in and around Lake Chad, which has shrunk 95% of its size in recent years with only modest recovery.1 2 In 2003, Chad became a petrol-producing country, and the current president is now in his fifth term of office.1 2 Long-term violence also affects Chad including intrastate conflicts. Four per cent of the population of Chad are refugees,1 many seeking asylum from recent wars in neighbouring countries, particularly in South Sudan and Central African Republic.

123;THE ANTHROPOCENE AND THE LONGEVITY REVOLUTION;"Abstract The Anthropocene, a term popularized in 2010 by Nobel Prize-winning chemist Paul Crutzen, refers to the current epoch during which human beings have begun to have a significant impact on the earth, e.g., the environment and climate change. Global population has grown approximately seven-fold over the past 200 years, while average life expectancy at birth has dramatically increased due to improvements in nutrition, medicine, and technology. The human Longevity Revolution thus provides important evidence of the Anthropocene. Yet, in the face of the Anthropocene, contemporary lifestyles rooted in capitalism–continually seeking more and bigger–are not sustainable; changes are needed for humanity to “live long on the damaged planet.” This presentation will discuss the Longevity Revolution in the context of the theory and previous research on the Anthropocene, then suggest an agenda for future research related to the intersection between the Anthropocene and the Longevity Revolution."

125;Constitutional Cohesion and Public Health Promotion - Part II;James G. Hodge, Jr. Public health across the United States is in trouble. Government de-funding and de-authorizations are gutting many traditional public health functions. The spread of multiple preventable diseases is on the rise. Rates of some chronic conditions and injuries are increasing. Life expectancy among select American subpopulations is actually going down.1 Coextensively, modern assessments reveal threats to social determinants of health. Prevailing federal and state health and tax policies fall hard on lower and middle classes.2 Deregulatory efforts in health care, housing, education, and climate change may negate decades of public health gains. Countering this bleak forecast for America’s health entails more than new law and policy approaches. It requires an innovative vision of the core role of law to further communal health. Part I of this commentary3 premised the promotion of the public’s health on the truism of “constitutional cohesion.” For many reasons constitutional structural principles (e.g., federalism, separation of powers) are often viewed distinctly from individual rights (e.g., due process, freedom of speech). The Bill of Rights to the federal Constitution was added only after structural foundations were laid out. For years, law schools have taught structural principles and rights in separate courses. Unsurprisingly, many lawyers, judges, and policymakers tend to see them discretely. In reality, structuraland rights-based constitutional norms are highly interdependent, working in tandem to limit governmental vices (e.g., oppression, overreaching, malfeasance, tyranny) (see Figure 1).4 Constitutional cohesion is a fine theory, but so what? In a 1969 lecture, Yale Law Professor Charles L. Black, Jr. forewarned: “One who reads at all in constitutional law will know, ruefully, that there is no new thing to be said, and that when you think you Constitutional Cohesion and Public Health Promotion Part II
126;Knowledge, democracy and action;"In the city where I live, Victoria, Canada, a wealthy city in a wealthy country, there are 1,500 women and men (in a population of 250,000) who do not have a place to sleep at night. In spite of the creation of a Coalition to End Homelessness, the numbers of people who suffer from poor health, violence, substance abuse as a result of poverty and homelessness continues at about the same level. In India, one of the fastest-growing economies in the world, 600 million people live without literacy, adequate water and sanitation, poor health facilities and insecure food security. Indigenous people in North and South America, Africa and Asia have dramatically lower life expectancy and higher levels of health difficulties than non-indigenous members of their communities. Their languages are disappearing daily and, with the languages, extraordinary parts of our human knowledge base and culture. Climate change is having a more dramatic impact on the poor and marginalized persons in all our communities; one has only to look at the earthquake in Haiti or the floods in Pakistan to see how natural disasters have an impact on the poor. Concerns with the protection of the wealthy from risk, the protection of access to non-renewable resources and water occupy the minds of vast numbers of the world’s inhabitants and a dramatically disproportionate level of government budgets. The neo-liberal global economic machine produces wealth in historically unheard of quantities but exacerbates the gap between the rich and the poor both within and among nations. These situations exist in spite of bodies of recent quality research on the impacts of inequality in our lives at both local and global levels. Richard Wilkinson and Kate Pickett’s exhaustive study of inequality and its impacts around the world is but one of the many technically competent and evidence-based studies which illustrate what many of us see in our work in communities on a day-to-day basis. According to Wilkinson and Pickett (2009), on almost every index of quality of life, or wellness, or deprivation, there is a strong correlation between a country’s level of economic inequality and its social outcomes. Almost always, Japan and the Scandinavian countries are at the favourable ‘low’ end, and almost always, the UK, the US and Portugal are at the unfavourable ‘high’ end, with Canada, Australia"
127;Insights from outside BJOG;"Life expectancy reflects the health of a country. As countries improve their health systems, longevity predictions rise mainly through the provision of basic public health facilities which decrease infant mortality rates and universal health coverage which reduces premature deaths in adults. However, the forecasting of life expectancy is far more complex than assessing levels of health care and has to contend with economic fortunes, political interventions, climate change, as well as behavioural and social trends such as smoking, obesity, exercise and drugs. Even religious, gender and belief issues can sway calculations, so data collection has to be from multiple sources and their interpretation pooled. The latest set of results uses ‘a Bayesian model ensemble’ to project life expectancy in 35 developed countries (Kontis et al. Lancet 2017; 389:1323–35). It is an actuarially dense piece with the highlights summarised as follows:"
128;Mapping and modeling Dirofilaria infections in Europe;"Climate change and increasing temperatures are a global phenomenon that can influence the dynamics of a number of hematophagous arthropods, vectors of pathogens with importance in human and veterinary medicine. In fact, climatic changes, together with an increase in the movement of dogs across Europe, have caused an increase in the geographical range of Dirofilaria immitis and D. repens infections. A Geographic Information System based on thermal regimen was constructed to identify areas potentially suitable for Dirofilaria transmission in Europe. These models are based on evidence that: i) there is a threshold of 14 °C below which Dirofilaria development will not proceed in mosquitoes; ii) there is a requirement of 130 growing degree-days for larvae to reach infectivity, and; iii) there is a maximum life expectancy of 30 days for a mosquito vector. The output of these models predicted that the summer temperatures (with peaks in July and August) are sufficient to facilitate extrinsic incubation of Dirofilaria even at high latitudes. Recently, an additional model was constructed to verify the influence of temperature in the course of three decades (1980-1989, 1990-1999 and 2000-2012) on the risk of infection by Dirofilaria in Italy. The results showed an expected increasing trend of temperatures, an increase of the Dirofilaria generation numbers into the mosquitoes and a significant extension of the infection risk from 5-6 months (1980-1989) to 6.5 months (1990-1999), up to more than 7 months (2000-20012). These findings show that geospatial tools are very useful for mapping, monitoring, forecasting and surveillance of both heartworm and subcutaneous dirofilariasis."
129;Cobenefits of Insulating Houses;People spend most of the time indoors, so indoor temperatures and air quality are important. There is growing evidence that retrofitting insulation in existing houses improves health, wellbeing, and life expectancy, as well as having many cobenefits, including reducing fuel poverty, increasing energy efficiency, and mitigating climate change. The cost-effectiveness of retrofitted insulation programs has been increased by their ability to provide employment during economic recessions. This chapter summarizes the broad outcomes of several large-scale retrofit insulation and heating programs before analyzing the different policy frameworks that have been used to justify retrofitted insulation policies.
130;Switch to diesel engines is significantly to blame for poor air quality in UK cities, experts say;Government policies to encourage motorists to switch to diesel engines may have backfired, experts have said, as diesel fumes are now being blamed for the poor air quality in UK cities that is damaging health and reducing life expectancy.  Successive governments have encouraged a switch to diesel powered transport in a bid to tackle climate change because diesel vehicles are more fuel efficient and emit less carbon dioxide than those powered by petrol. Drivers have been keen to make the switch because diesel vehicles are more economical to run, and more than half of new cars are now diesel.  However, diesel engines produce tiny particulate matter, which is an important contributor to poor air quality in UK cities. As well as exacerbating conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, particulate matter is estimated to be responsible for 29 000 deaths each year in the United Kingdom and …
131;Aerosol retrieval algorithm for the characterization of local aerosol using MODIS L1B data;Atmospheric aerosol plays an important role in radiation budget, climate change, hydrology and visibility. However, it has immense effect on the air quality, especially in densely populated areas where high concentration of aerosol is associated with premature death and the decrease of life expectancy. Therefore, an accurate estimation of aerosol with spatial distribution is essential, and satellite data has increasingly been used to estimate aerosol optical depth (AOD). Aerosol product (AOD) from Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data is available at global scale but problems arise due to low spatial resolution, time-lag availability of AOD product as well as the use of generalized aerosol models in retrieval algorithm instead of local aerosol models. This study focuses on the aerosol retrieval algorithm for the characterization of local aerosol in Hong Kong for a long period of time (2006-2011) using high spatial resolution MODIS level 1B data (500 m resolution) and taking into account the local aerosol models. Two methods (dark dense vegetation and MODIS land surface reflectance product) were used for the estimation of the surface reflectance over land and Santa Barbara DISORT Radiative Transfer (SBDART) code was used to construct LUTs for calculating the aerosol reflectance as a function of AOD. Results indicate that AOD can be estimated at the local scale from high resolution MODIS data, and the obtained accuracy (ca. 87%) is very much comparable with the accuracy obtained from other studies (80%-95%) for AOD estimation.
132;The First KACST-Oxford Petrochemical Forum, 2011;"All around us we see the remarkable advances that petrochemical technologies have brought to humankind and our society. Life expectancy, economic advancement and global mobility are all striking examples of the benefits of real ingenuity and innovation over many decades in the science and technological utilisation of fossil fuels. One also recognises that society’s current energy trajectory is not sustainable; this trajectory is running alongside the critical issues of human-induced climate change and potential ecological destruction. The petrochemical sector is now rising to the challenge of global energy sustainability. The sector also needs to be more energy efficient with mounting pressure on rising feedstock prices and ever-increasing regulatory and commercial requirements. The KACST-Oxford Forum—the first of its kind— attempted to address many of these issues facing the petrochemical technologies. It also recognised the special responsibilities that Saudi Arabia has as the world’s leading petroleum and petrochemical production centre. Our 1st KACST-Oxford Forum therefore targeted not only the challenge of building the future of petrochemical technologies in a sustainable way, but also to highlight the new and exciting opportunities that such an approach brings. Thus, whilst recognising the critical need for the development of alternative energy technologies, our vision is that the world is equally served in the short and medium terms by real advances and real innovation in developing cleaner, more efficient and more economic petrochemical production and conversion technologies. Five major thematic areas were covered:"
133;Are king penguin populations threatened by Southern Ocean warming?;"Recently, Le Bohec et al. (1) inferred that king penguins (Aptenodytes patagonicus) are at heavy extinction risk under current global warming predictions. Although their demographic modeling was elegant, they based further inferences on results showing that warm El Nino–Southern Oscillation events negatively affect both breeding success and adult survival. Although the results are interesting, we here warn against conclusions that are probably too strong. First, king penguin populations, including the one studied by Le Bohec et al., have increased exponentially since the 1960s (2, 3) despite coincident warming of the northern Southern Ocean (4); today, its world population totals ≈1.5 million breeding pairs. Second, evidence exists for density dependence in this species' population growth rate (3), which may affect its response to climate change. Third, described relationships are derived from short time series (breeding success, 6 years; adult survival, 8 years) relative to the species' 30-year life expectancy, analogous to the closely related emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri). Such time series are too short to evaluate temporal variation without sampling error, and extinction risk has not been evaluated with mechanistic population models. Finally, the temporary warming of El Nino may not be a surrogate for long-term climate effects, because the Southern Annular Mode has been locked in its positive state, duplicating La Nina conditions, since the mid-1970s, contributing greatly to climate effects observed thus far (5). Although Le Bohec et al. clearly demonstrate that ocean environment affects seabirds, a now well documented topic, longer time series and comprehensive population models are needed for more robust conclusions."
134;Growth in residential services in Australia and the United States: 1997–2002;"The most significant factors increasing demand for services and supports for people with intellectual disability are growth in national population and changes in the demographic structure of the population, particularly aging (Lakin & Stancliffe, 2005). In addition to the increasing proportion of elderly adults in the general population, specific examples of important demographic change include the effects of increased life expectancy of people with intellectual disability (Bittles et al., 2002; Yang, Rasmussen, & Friedman, 2002), and related survival rates of low and very low birth-weight infants; and the aging of family caregivers with whom many adults with intellectual disability currently live. This paper deals with growth in residential services in Australia and the United States (US) for people with intellectual disability, as it relates to one of these factors: national population growth. In a climate of substantial unmet need (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare [AIHW], 2002; Prouty, Smith, & Lakin, 2004), real growth in residential services is required if unmet need for these services is to be addressed. As national population increases, so too does the population of people with intellectual disability, resulting in an increased absolute level of demand for intellectual disability services even if the proportion of people receiving services remains unchanged. Real growth in residential services requires that the rate of growth in residential provision is faster than the growth rate for national population. To identify the extent of real growth in residential services (known as accommodation support services in Australia) we compared annual changes in service provision with growth of national population in Australia and the United States since 1997. These data are shown in Figs. 1 and 2 respectively. Australian data (Fig. 1) are shown only to 2002, because the method of data collection changed thereafter from the previous annual snapshot-data collections, so that 2003 data are not comparable to earlier data. Note that the slopes of all the lines in Figs. 1 and 2 are directly comparable to one another because all the y-axes have a data range of 20% of the minimum value for that axis. Population data show the national population on June 30 of each year. US residential service data (Fig. 2) are a snapshot (point census) from June 30 each year. Australian residential service data (Fig. 1) are also from a snapshot day during the year. Both national data sets exclude respite places."
135;ENERGY, LIMITS TO GROWTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH: WHAT IS THE ROLE OF ENVIRONMENTAL EPIDEMIOLOGY?;Background and Aims: The literature concerning impending energy insecurity, food prices and climate change is growing rapidly. These problems reflect manifestations of “limits to growth”, including climate change, though what is “limited” in this case is not carbon emissions, but the capacity of Earth to absorb waste gases without great harm to the climate, ecology and, ultimately, civilisation (hence health). Limits to growth interact. For example rising energy prices lift fertiliser costs and divert agricultural capacity from food to fuel. Climate change impairs crop yields and harms nutrition synergistically in other ways such as by reducing water quality. Collectively, the diverse phenomena of “limits to growth” will place increasing and eventually immense strain on the capacity of global public health services to maintain global life expectancy, especially given the background of rising population size. Methods: A limited literature search was conducted in health journals (using PubMed, Google Scholar and specific journals) searching for the following terms: “peak oil”, “energy scarcity”, “limits to growth”, “ecological footprint”, “global environmental change”, “peak health”, “peak phosphorus” and “civilisation collapse”. The term “climate change” was excluded because the research question studied here is broader. Results: Within the broader medical and public health literature there is a limited awareness of peak oil, however papers are mainly restricted to or in response to one research group. In the epidemiological literature, including environmental epidemiology, these topics are scarcely mentioned, apart from several articles in the mid 1990s. Conclusions: Rising energy prices and other manifestations of limits to growth are important environmental determinants of health. Environmental epidemiologists need to urgently consider these dimensions, and to embrace interdisciplinary approaches to consider how to prevent what Homer-Dixon calls “synchronous failure”.

136;Substituting ‘H2 for C’ and reducing global inequalities in health;Life expectancy and health differ greatly between emerging and developed countries and within countries. Global dependence on fossil fuels contributes to health inequalities through air pollution, the geopolitics of scarce resources and probable climate change arising from global warming. Substituting for fossil fuels (C), hydrogen (H2), as vector and store of energy produced from low-carbon and/or renewable sources could reduce health inequalities by improving the environment. It is unlikely that the global market would initiate such a change. Nation-states would not act alone and would need to cooperate in leading it. Global recession might be the incentive that is needed to restructure a C-economy into an H2-economy. Yet, the transition would carry high costs, which would have to be borne by the developed countries in order to achieve a new treaty that included emerging countries. H2 for C is thus not only a technical fix, but also a global-ethical choice.
137;Trees, Climate Change, and Health: An Urban Planning, Greening and Implementation Perspective;The In Conversation: Boundary, Spanners, Thinkers and Policy Actors Round Table Series provides a platform for researchers, policy actors, and implementation experts to elevate discussion on emerging issues, present new and upcoming research, and facilitate conversations around impacts and possible solutions. This brief report, on trees, climate change, and health, reflects a conversation between the authors of this paper, along with supporting literature. It explores the potential of green spaces and trees as a viable strategy to address climate change challenges and simultaneously improve population health, well-being, and health equity. In particular, it highlights the public health benefits of trees and green space, the challenges faced in urban areas, and opportunities for the protection, maintenance and regeneration of urban green space.
138;Climate Change and Health Preparedness in Africa: Analysing Trends in Six African Countries;Climate change is a global problem, which affects the various geographical regions at different levels. It is also associated with a wide range of human health problems, which pose a burden to health systems, especially in regions such as Africa. Indeed, across the African continent public health systems are under severe pressure, partly due to their fragile socioeconomic conditions. This paper reports on a cross-sectional study in six African countries (Ghana, Nigeria, South Africa, Namibia, Ethiopia, and Kenya) aimed at assessing their vulnerabilities to climate change, focusing on its impacts on human health. The study evaluated the levels of information, knowledge, and perceptions of public health professionals. It also examined the health systems’ preparedness to cope with these health hazards, the available resources, and those needed to build resilience to the country’s vulnerable population, as perceived by health professionals. The results revealed that 63.1% of the total respondents reported that climate change had been extensively experienced in the past years, while 32% claimed that the sampled countries had experienced them to some extent. Nigerian respondents recorded the highest levels (67.7%), followed by Kenya with 66.6%. South Africa had the lowest level of impact as perceived by the respondents (50.0%) when compared with the other sampled countries. All respondents from Ghana and Namibia reported that health problems caused by climate change are common in the two countries. As perceived by the health professionals, the inadequate resources reiterate the need for infrastructural resources, medical equipment, emergency response resources, and technical support. The study’s recommendations include the need to improve current policies at all levels (i.e., national, regional, and local) on climate change and public health and to strengthen health professionals’ skills. Improving the basic knowledge of health institutions to better respond to a changing climate is also recommended. The study provides valuable insights which may be helpful to other nations in Sub-Saharan Africa.
139;Public Perceptions of Climate Change and Health—A Cross-Sectional Survey Study;Climate change is inseparably linked to human health. Although there is growing awareness of the threats to human health caused by climate change, it remains unclear how the German population perceives the relevance of climate change and its health consequences. Between May and September 2022, German residents were invited to participate in a cross-sectional online survey that explored three content areas: (1) the relevance of climate change, (2) health risks in connection with climate change and (3) collective and individual options for action against climate change. A total of 697 full data sets were collected for analysis (72% female, 51% ≥55 years old). The majority of participants agreed that human-induced climate change exists (85%), and that it has an impact on human health (83%). They also perceived the global population to be more strongly impacted by climate change than themselves (89% versus 68%). Most participants (76%) claimed to personally contribute to climate protection and 23% felt that their city or council contributed to climate protection. Although the majority of participants saw climate change as a threat to human health, they perceived other population groups to be most strongly affected. Cognitive dissonance might explain this lack of individual concern and one approach to addressing such distorted perceptions might be the dissemination of appropriate risk communication with health professionals involved in the communication.
140;Climate Change and Health in Urban Areas with a Mediterranean Climate: A Conceptual Framework with a Social and Climate Justice Approach;"The consequences of climate change are becoming increasingly evident and highlight the important interdependence between the well-being of people and ecosystems. Although climate change is a global phenomenon, its causes and consequences vary dramatically across territories and population groups. Among settings particularly susceptible to health impacts from climate change are cities with a Mediterranean climate. Here, impacts will put additional pressure on already-stressed ecosystems and vulnerable economies and societies, increasing health inequalities. Therefore, this article presents and discusses a conceptual framework for understanding the complex relationship between climate change and health in the context of cities with Mediterranean climate from a social and climate justice approach. The different elements that integrate the conceptual framework are: (1) the determinants of climate change; (2) its environmental and social consequences; (3) its direct and indirect impacts on health; and (4) the role of mitigation and adaptation policies. The model places special emphasis on the associated social and health inequalities through (1) the recognition of the role of systems of privilege and oppression; (2) the distinction between structural and intermediate determinants of climate change at the root of health inequalities; (3) the role of individual and collective vulnerability in mediating the effects of climate change on health; and (4) the need to act from a climate justice perspective to reverse health inequities."
141;Building Resilient Cities: Climate Change and Health Interlinkages in the Planning of Public Spaces;Greenhouse gases emissions resulting from the combustion of fossil fuels are worsening air quality and affecting the climate system. While climate change impacts on meteorological variables affects air quality by altering the concentration and distribution of pollutants, air pollution significantly influences the climate, leading to negative impacts on human health. Due to the combination of high temperatures, air pollution, and high population density, cities are particularly vulnerable to climate change impacts. The planning and design of public spaces aimed at climate change mitigation and adaptation can result in multiple co-benefits for human health, while reducing social inequalities. To address the major research gaps in the communication between health and planning experts, and the lack of capacity among public sectors and policy makers, it is necessary to promote capacity building and knowledge sharing between the planning and health sectors. The purpose of this article is to develop preliminary recommendations for a process that allows a comprehensive assessment of the interlinkages between climate and health, social, environmental, and economic vulnerabilities, and the quality of the urban spaces, to support local governments, policymakers, and education institutions in making informed decisions for public spaces. The methods applied were a literature review and interviews with experts.
142;Climate Change and Health Threats;Potential health risks due to climate change are not entirely unanticipated and have been warned of by scientists and researchers for decades. As the effects of climate become more pronounced, there is growing evidence of its severe impact on human health. This paper will focus on the indicators, specific health issues, the people who are affected the most, and various companies’ initiatives towards alleviating this issue.
143;Addressing Mental Health in a Changing Climate: Incorporating Mental Health Indicators into Climate Change and Health Vulnerability and Adaptation Assessments;"A growing number of health authorities around the world are conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments; however, few explore impacts and adaptations related to mental health. We argue for an expanded conceptualization of health that includes both the physiological and psychological aspects of climate change and health. Through a review of the global literature on mental health and climate change, this analytical review explores how mental health can be integrated into climate change and health vulnerability assessments and concludes with recommendations for integrating mental health within climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments."
144;Climate change and health in urban informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries – a scoping review of health impacts and adaptation strategies;ABSTRACT Background: Climate change affects human health with those with the least resources being most vulnerable. However, little is known about the impact of climate change on human health and effective adaptation methods in informal settlements in low- and middle-income countries. Objective: The objective of this scoping review was to identify, characterize, and summarize research evidence on the impact of climate change on human health in informal settlements and the available adaptation methods and interventions. Method: A scoping review was conducted using the Arksey and O’Malley framework. The four bibliographic databases PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane library were searched. Eligibility criteria were all types of peer-reviewed publications reporting on climate change or related extreme weather events (as defined by the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change), informal settlements (as defined by UN-Habitat), low- and middle-income countries (as defined by the World Bank) and immediate human health impacts. Review selection and characterization were performed by two independent reviewers using a predefined form. Results: Out of 1197 studies initially identified, 15 articles were retained. We found nine original research articles, and six reviews, commentaries, and editorials. The articles were reporting on the exposures flooding, temperature changes and perceptions of climate change with health outcomes broadly categorized as mental health, communicable diseases, and non-communicable diseases. Six studies had a geographical focus on Asia, four on Africa, and one on South America, the remaining four articles had no geographical focus. One article investigated an adaptation method for heat exposure. Serval other adaptation methods were proposed, though they were not investigated by the articles in this review. Conclusion: There is a paucity of original research and solid study designs. Further studies are needed to improve the understanding of the impact, the most effective adaptation methods and to inform policy making.
145;Assessment of Knowledge regarding Climate Change and Health among Adolescents in Yogyakarta, Indonesia;This research was aimed at providing evidence on climate change and health knowledge among adolescents. A cross-sectional study was conducted in Yogyakarta city from June to September 2016. A structured questionnaire was used to collect data among 508 adolescents who were in the second grade of a senior high school. This study revealed that participants had a low and inconsistent understanding regarding climate change and its impact on health. They reported that they prefer to get climate change information via talking with family. In summary, adolescent knowledge regarding climate change and health needs to improve with proper content and appropriate media.
146;Scoping Review of Climate Change and Health Research in the Philippines: A Complementary Tool in Research Agenda-Setting;"The impacts of climate change on human health have been observed and projected in the Philippines as vector-borne and heat-related diseases have and continue to increase. As a response, the Philippine government has given priority to climate change and health as one of the main research funding topics. To guide in identifying more specific research topics, a scoping review was done to complement the agenda-setting process by mapping out the extent of climate change and health research done in the country. Research articles and grey literature published from 1980 to 2017 were searched from online databases and search engines, and a total of 34 quantitative studies were selected. Fifty-three percent of the health topics studied were about mosquito-borne diseases, particularly dengue fever. Seventy-nine percent of the studies reported evidence of positive associations between climate factors and health outcomes. Recommended broad research themes for funding were health vulnerability, health adaptation, and co-benefits. Other notable recommendations were the development of open data and reproducible modeling schemes. In conclusion, the scoping review was useful in providing a background for research agenda-setting; however, additional analyses or consultations should be complementary for added depth."
147;Commentary - The Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program: Indigenous Climate Leaders' Championing Adaptation Effort.;The Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program (CCHAP) is a program within the First Nations Inuit Health Branch of Indigenous Services Canada (which was previously under the responsibility of Health Canada). The CCHAP supports Inuit and First Nation communities in mitigating and adapting to the health impacts of climate change. The impacts of climate change on Indigenous health can be observed in multiple areas including, but not limited to, food security, cultural medicines, mental health and landbased practices. This program seeks to address the needs of climate change and health in First Nation and Inuit communities to support resiliency and adaptation to a changing climate both now and in the future through its emphasis on youth and capacity building. The commentary is based on the Program's eleven years of experience working with and for Indigenous communities and provides an overview of the CCHAP model and the work it has and continues to support. This paper demonstrates three examples of community-based projects to mitigate and adapt to the health impacts of climate change to demonstrate climate change resiliency within Indigenous communities.
148;A brief introduction to climate change and health;Our climate is changing at an unprecedented rate. This not only has impacts on the planet and the ecosystem, with extinction rates rising rapidly, but also on human health (Figure 1). The effects of climate change are and will continue to disrupt the basic requirements for health such as clean water, clean air, adequate food and will furthermore exacerbate underlying social, economic, and ecological.
149;Health impacts of climate change and health and social inequalities in the UK;This article examines how social and health inequalities shape the health impacts of climate change in the UK, and what the implications are for climate change adaptation and health care provision. The evidence generated by the other articles of the special issue were interpreted using social justice reasoning in light of additional literature, to draw out the key implications of health and social inequalities for health outcomes of climate change. Exposure to heat and cold, air pollution, pollen, food safety risks, disruptions to access to and functioning of health services and facilities, emerging infections and flooding are examined as the key impacts of climate change influencing health outcomes. Age, pre-existing medical conditions and social deprivation are found to be the key (but not only) factors that make people vulnerable and to experience more adverse health outcomes related to climate change impacts. In the future, climate change, aging population and decreasing public spending on health and social care may aggravate inequality of health outcomes related to climate change. Health education and public preparedness measures that take into account differential exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity of different groups help address health and social inequalities to do with climate change. Adaptation strategies based on individual preparedness, action and behaviour change may aggravate health and social inequalities due to their selective uptake, unless they are coupled with broad public information campaigns and financial support for undertaking adaptive measures.
150;An Assessment of Climate Change and Health Vulnerability and Adaptation in Dominica;A climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessment was conducted in Dominica, a Caribbean small island developing state located in the Lesser Antilles. The assessment revealed that the country’s population is already experiencing many impacts on health and health systems from climate variability and change. Infectious diseases as well as food and waterborne diseases pose continued threats as climate change may exacerbate the related health risks. Threats to food security were also identified, with particular concern for food production systems. The findings of the assessment included near-term and long-term adaptation options that can inform actions of health sector decision-makers in addressing health vulnerabilities and building resilience to climate change. Key challenges include the need for enhanced financial and human resources to build awareness of key health risks and increase adaptive capacity. Other small island developing states interested in pursuing a vulnerability and adaptation assessment may find this assessment approach, key findings, analysis, and lessons learned useful.
151;Climate Change and Health: A Position Paper of the American College of Physicians.;"Climate change could have a devastating effect on human and environmental health. Potential effects of climate change on human health include higher rates of respiratory and heat-related illness, increased prevalence of vector-borne and waterborne diseases, food and water insecurity, and malnutrition. Persons who are elderly, sick, or poor are especially vulnerable to these potential consequences. Addressing climate change could have substantial benefits to human health. In this position paper, the American College of Physicians (ACP) recommends that physicians and the broader health care community throughout the world engage in environmentally sustainable practices that reduce carbon emissions; support efforts to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change; and educate the public, their colleagues, their community, and lawmakers about the health risks posed by climate change. Tackling climate change is an opportunity to dramatically improve human health and avert dire environmental outcomes, and ACP believes that physicians can play a role in achieving this goal."
152;Editorial: Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) 2023 Guidelines for COPD, Including COVID-19, Climate Change, and Air Pollution;The 2023 Global Initiative for Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) report includes relevant topics from the clinician’s perspective and evidence published on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) since GOLD 2017. The World Health Organization (WHO) and GOLD 2023 have developed an updated definition of COPD as, “a heterogeneous lung condition characterized by chronic respiratory symptoms (dyspnea, cough, expectoration, exacerbations) due to abnormalities of the airway (bronchitis, bronchiolitis) and/or alveoli (emphysema) that cause persistent, often progressive, airflow obstruction.” GOLD 2023 includes recommendations for COPD patients diagnosed with COVID-19 and acknowledges the role of reduced air quality in the etiology and progression of COPD. In May 2023, the GOLD Scientific Committee on Air Pollution and COPD reported that air pollution increasingly contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. This Editorial aims to introduce the updated GOLD 2023 report in the context of climate change and the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic.
153;Climate Change and Health under the Shared Socioeconomic Pathway Framework;A growing body of literature addresses how climate change is likely to have substantial and generally adverse effects on population health and health systems around the world. These effects are likely to vary within and between countries and, importantly, will vary depending on different socioeconomic development patterns. Transitioning to a more resilient and sustainable world to prepare for and manage the effects of climate change is likely to result in better health outcomes. Sustained fossil fuel development will likely result in continued high burdens of preventable conditions, such as undernutrition, malaria, and diarrheal diseases. Using a new set of socioeconomic development trajectories, the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs), along with the World Health Organization’s Operational Framework for Building Climate Resilient Health Systems, we extend existing storylines to illustrate how various aspects of health systems are likely to be affected under each SSP. We also discuss the implications of our findings on how the burden of mortality and the achievement of health-related Sustainable Development Goal targets are likely to vary under different SSPs.
154;Climate change and health in Bangladesh: a baseline cross-sectional survey;Background Bangladesh is facing the unavoidable challenge of adaptation to climate change. However, very little is known in relation to climate change and health. This article provides information on potential climate change impact on health, magnitude of climate-sensitive diseases, and baseline scenarios of health systems to climate variability and change. Design A cross-sectional study using multistage cluster sampling framework was conducted in 2012 among 6,720 households of 224 rural villages in seven vulnerable districts of Bangladesh. Information was obtained from head of the households using a pretested, interviewer-administered, structured questionnaire. A total of 6,720 individuals participated in the study with written, informed consent. Results The majority of the respondents were from the low-income vulnerable group (60% farmers or day labourers) with an average of 30 years’ stay in their locality. Most of them (96%) had faced extreme weather events, 45% of people had become homeless and displaced for a mean duration of 38 days in the past 10 years. Almost all of the respondents (97.8%) believe that health care expenditure increased after the extreme weather events. Mean annual total health care expenditure was 6,555 Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) (1 USD=77 BDT in 2015) and exclusively out of pocket of the respondents. Incidence of dengue was 1.29 (95% CI 0.65–2.56) and malaria 13.86 (95% CI 6.00–32.01) per 1,000 adult population for 12 months preceding the data collection. Incidence of diarrhoea and pneumonia among under-five children of the households for the preceding month was 10.3% (95% CI 9.16–11.66) and 7.3% (95% CI 6.35–8.46), respectively. Conclusions The findings of this survey indicate that climate change has a potential adverse impact on human health in Bangladesh. The magnitude of malaria, dengue, childhood diarrhoea, and pneumonia was high among the vulnerable communities. Community-based adaptation strategy for health could be beneficial to minimise climate change attributed health burden of Bangladesh.
155;Anthropogenic climate change and health in the Global South.;This paper explores evidence relevant to the hypothesis that human-generated climate change (global warming) is already, and will increasingly, add to the existing burden of disadvantage experienced by populations in low-income countries, the 'Global South'. Well recognised health manifestations of global warming include from heatwaves and other extreme weather events, changes to infectious disease patterns, and undernutrition, arising from higher food prices, reduced food availability and reduced nutrient concentrations of many foods. These effects have been called 'primary' and 'secondary'. Although these manifestations will have effects globally, their biggest impact on health is and will be upon poor and vulnerable populations in low-income settings. Also well recognised, manual labourers are increasingly vulnerable from excessive heat and humidity. There is less recognition that climate change interacts with social and political determinants of health, contributing to 'tertiary' health consequences including conflict, forced migration and famine. In turn, these effects may deepen poverty traps in the Global South. Human-generated climate change is principally caused by the policies and lifestyles of populations in high-income countries (the Global North). The recent recognition by the British government that climate change is an emergency is encouraging, and may help motivate the widespread global behavioural changes that are needed to reduce the many risks from global warming, including to the people of the South.
156;Communicating climate change and health in the media;The translation of science from research to real-world change is a central goal of public health. Communication has an essential role to play in provoking a response to climate change. It must first raise awareness, make people feel involved and ultimately motivate them to take action. The goal of this research is to understand how the information related to this issue is being addressed and disseminated to different audiences—public citizens, politicians and key climate change stakeholders. Initial results show that the scientific voice struggles to globally highlight this issue to a general audience and that messages that address the topic do not meet the challenges, going from a dramatic framing to a basic adaptation framing. Communication experts can help inform scientists and policy makers on how to best share information about climate change in an engaging and motivating way. This study gives an insight about the key role of the media and communications in addressing themes relating to climate change and transmitting information to the public in order to take action.
157;Assessing climate change and health vulnerability at the local level: Travis County, Texas.;We created a measure to help comprehend population vulnerability to potential flooding and excessive heat events using health, built environment and social factors. Through principal component analysis (PCA), we created non-weighted sum index scores of literature-reviewed social and built environment characteristics. We created baseline poor health measures using 1999-2005 age-adjusted cardiovascular and combined diabetes and hypertension mortality rates to correspond with social-built environment indices. We mapped US Census block groups by linked age-adjusted mortality and a PCA-created social-built environment index. The goal was to measure flooding and excessive heat event vulnerability as proxies for population vulnerability to climate change for Travis County, Texas. This assessment identified communities where baseline poor health, social marginalisation and built environmental impediments intersected. Such assessments may assist targeted interventions and improve emergency preparedness in identified vulnerable communities, while fostering resilience through the focus of climate change adaptation policies at the local level.
158;American Thoracic Society member survey on climate change and health.;"The American Thoracic Society (ATS), in collaboration with George Mason University, surveyed a random sample of ATS members to assess their perceptions of, clinical experiences with, and preferred policy responses to climate change. An e-mail containing an invitation from the ATS President and a link to an online survey was sent to 5,500 randomly selected U.S. members; up to four reminder e-mails were sent to nonrespondents. Responses were received from members in 49 states and the District of Columbia (n = 915); the response rate was 17%. Geographic distribution of respondents mirrored that of the sample. Survey estimates' confidence intervals were ±3.5% or smaller. Results indicate that a large majority of ATS members have concluded that climate change is happening (89%), that it is driven by human activity (68%), and that it is relevant to patient care (""a great deal""/""a moderate amount"") (65%). A majority of respondents indicated they were already observing health impacts of climate change among their patients, most commonly as increases in chronic disease severity from air pollution (77%), allergic symptoms from exposure to plants or mold (58%), and severe weather injuries (57%). A larger majority anticipated seeing these climate-related health impacts in the next 2 decades. Respondents indicated that physicians and physician organizations should play an active role in educating patients, the public, and policy makers on the human health effects of climate change. Overall, ATS members are observing that human health is already adversely affected by climate change and support responses to address this situation."
159;Data Mashups: Potential Contribution to Decision Support on Climate Change and Health;Linking environmental, socioeconomic and health datasets provides new insights into the potential associations between climate change and human health and wellbeing, and underpins the development of decision support tools that will promote resilience to climate change, and thus enable more effective adaptation. This paper outlines the challenges and opportunities presented by advances in data collection, storage, analysis, and access, particularly focusing on “data mashups”. These data mashups are integrations of different types and sources of data, frequently using open application programming interfaces and data sources, to produce enriched results that were not necessarily the original reason for assembling the raw source data. As an illustration of this potential, this paper describes a recently funded initiative to create such a facility in the UK for use in decision support around climate change and health, and provides examples of suitable sources of data and the purposes to which they can be directed, particularly for policy makers and public health decision makers.
160;Climate change and health costs of air emissions from biofuels and gasoline;Environmental impacts of energy use can impose large costs on society. We quantify and monetize the life-cycle climate-change and health effects of greenhouse gas (GHG) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) emissions from gasoline, corn ethanol, and cellulosic ethanol. For each billion ethanol-equivalent gallons of fuel produced and combusted in the US, the combined climate-change and health costs are $469 million for gasoline, $472–952 million for corn ethanol depending on biorefinery heat source (natural gas, corn stover, or coal) and technology, but only $123–208 million for cellulosic ethanol depending on feedstock (prairie biomass, Miscanthus, corn stover, or switchgrass). Moreover, a geographically explicit life-cycle analysis that tracks PM2.5 emissions and exposure relative to U.S. population shows regional shifts in health costs dependent on fuel production systems. Because cellulosic ethanol can offer health benefits from PM2.5 reduction that are of comparable importance to its climate-change benefits from GHG reduction, a shift from gasoline to cellulosic ethanol has greater advantages than previously recognized. These advantages are critically dependent on the source of land used to produce biomass for biofuels, on the magnitude of any indirect land use that may result, and on other as yet unmeasured environmental impacts of biofuels.
161;Climate Change and Health on the U.S. Gulf Coast: Public Health Adaptation is Needed to Address Future Risks;The impacts of climate change on human health have been documented globally and in the United States. Numerous studies project greater morbidity and mortality as a result of extreme weather events and other climate-sensitive hazards. Public health impacts on the U.S. Gulf Coast may be severe as the region is expected to experience increases in extreme temperatures, sea level rise, and possibly fewer but more intense hurricanes. Through myriad pathways, climate change is likely to make the Gulf Coast less hospitable and more dangerous for its residents, and may prompt substantial migration from and into the region. Public health impacts may be further exacerbated by the concentration of people and infrastructure, as well as the region’s coastal geography. Vulnerable populations, including the very young, elderly, and socioeconomically disadvantaged may face particularly high threats to their health and well-being. This paper provides an overview of potential public health impacts of climate variability and change on the Gulf Coast, with a focus on the region’s unique vulnerabilities, and outlines recommendations for improving the region’s ability to minimize the impacts of climate-sensitive hazards. Public health adaptation aimed at improving individual, public health system, and infrastructure resilience is urgently needed to meet the challenges climate change may pose to the Gulf Coast in the coming decades.
162;Climate Change and Health;What emerging public health threat is complex, multifaceted, dynamic, has the potential to get much worse, and won’t be eliminated any time soon? If you answered “terrorism”, you’d be right. But you’d also be right to answer “climate change.” And in fact, climate change has killed more people than terrorism has—a lot more. It’s perhaps understandable that terrorism generates much more attention and concern, yet public health responses should be proportionate to actual, not perceived, threats.
163;Impacts of Climate Change on Health and Health Services in Northern New South Wales, Australia: A Rapid Review;Climate change is exposing populations to increasing temperatures and extreme weather events in many parts of Australia. To prepare for climate challenges, there is a growing need for Local Health Districts (LHDs) to identify potential health impacts in their region and strengthen the capacity of the health system to respond accordingly. This rapid review summarised existing evidence and research gaps on the impact of climate change on health and health services in Northern New South Wales (NSW)—a ‘hotspot’ for climate disaster declarations. We systematically searched online databases and selected 11 peer-reviewed studies published between 2012–2022 for the Northern NSW region. The most explored health outcome was mental health in the aftermath of floods and droughts, followed by increased healthcare utilisation due to respiratory, cardiovascular and mortality outcomes associated with bushfire smoke or heat waves. Future research directions were recommended to understand: the compounding impacts of extreme events on health and the health system, local data needs that can better inform models that predict future health risks and healthcare utilisation for the region, and the needs of vulnerable populations that require a whole-of-system response during the different phases of disasters. In conclusion, the review provided climate change and health research directions the LHD may undertake to inform future adaptation and mitigation policies and strategies relevant to their region.
164;Climate change and health – what’s the problem?;The scientific consensus is that global warming is occurring and is largely the result of greenhouse gas emissions from human activity. This paper examines the health implications of global warming, the current socio-political attitudes towards action on climate change and highlight the health co-benefits of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. In addition, policy development for climate change and health should embrace health systems strengthening, commencing by incorporating climate change targets into Millennium Development Goal 7.
165;Climate change and health;"IN RESPONSE: We respectfully disagree with Dr. Mondrow's claim that ACP's policy paper on climate change and health is an egregious overreach that is outside the College's mission. The ACP became involved in analyzing the health effects of climate change and developing our policy paper at the request of our Board of Governorsleaders of our state and international chapters elected by the membership. The Board of Governors' resolution asked the Board of Regents to support efforts to educate and respond to the medical consequences of climate change affecting or potentially affecting patients. The Board of Regents adopted the resolution in November 2014. As requested by the Board of Governors, our Health and Public Policy Committeemade up of practicing internistmembersreviewed the evidence on climate change's effect on human health and concluded that it poses an immediate and longer-term threat to individual and population health. The committee's draft position paper was reviewed and commented upon by our Board of Governors; ACP's councils of student members, young physicians, residents, and subspecialties; and independent experts in the science of climate change and its effect on health before being adopted as policy by ACP's Board of Regents. This process, involving review of the draft by hundreds of ACP members, ensured that the full and diverse range of views within our membership was considered. As atmospheric science does not fall within ACP's usual purview, it relied on the work of trusted, objective expertsincluding the National Academy of Sciences and the Royal College, the National Aeronautics and Space Administration, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Changeto reach its conclusion that the warming of climate is definite and that climate change is largely caused by human activity. These organizations do have the expertise to review the relevant data, and their consensus on anthropogenic climate change is clear. Dr. Mondrow's claim that the statement that ninety-seven percent of climate scientists agree that humans are largely causing global warming has been discredited is also unfounded. Although some proponents of doing nothing to address climate change have questioned the accuracy of Cook and colleagues' study, it was recently bolstered in the peer-reviewed scientific journal Environmental Research Letters in which the authors concluded that the consensus that humans are causing recent global warming is shared by 90%100% of publishing climate scientists according to six independent studies by co-authors of this paper and the finding of 97% consensus in published climate research is robust and consistent with other surveys of climate scientists and peer-reviewed studies (1). We believe that the paper on climate change and health objectively describes how climate change has affected, is affecting, and will continue to affect human health, from exacerbating respiratory disease to increasing the risk for heat-related illness. Climate change is an individual and public health issue. Because it affects the patients whom our members treat, ACP believes that it is imperative that our members work to become educated about climate change and health, reduce the greenhouse gas footprint of their own practices, and advocate for policies to adapt to and mitigate climate change. Dr. Berman expresses concern about Recommendation 3 of the position paper, which states, Physicians, both individually and collectively, are encouraged to advocate for climate change adaptation and mitigation policies and communicate about the health cobenefits of addressing climate change in objective, simple language to their community and policymakers. He proposes that physicians may lack the expertise to independently analyze climate change research, making it difficult to effectively discuss climate change adaptation and mitigation policies with their patients. We clarify that the intent of the recommendation is to call on physicians and other health care professionals, both individually and collectively, to advocate for action to address climate change to members of their community and policymakers. To assist our members in this charge, ACP has developed a Climate Change Action Plan, a toolkit including talking points and presentation slides that can be used for chapter presentations, grand rounds, and other educational opportunities. Because health careand particularly hospitalsis among the most energy-intensive commercial sectors, the toolkit includes a collection of Greening the Health Care Sector documents to help guide physicians and their colleagues to make their practices and facilities more environmentally sustainable by addressing energy management, transportation, waste and food, and the built environment. The toolkit includes a Patient FACTS education document developed by ACP's Center for Patient Partnership in Healthcare, part of the College's patient-tested educational series designed to help patients increase their understanding of health issues. We agree with Dr. Reines that agriculture and food production are major sources of greenhouse gas emissions and that reducing meat protein consumption could help mitigate climate change. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the agriculture, forestry, and other land use sector is responsible for approximately 25% of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions (2). Under the rationale for Position 1, which recommends the development and implementation of strategies to adapt to and mitigate climate change, ACP's policy paper states, The agricultural sector is a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions, such as methane from livestock. By reducing demand for greenhouse gasintensive meat in high-income countries and shifting to healthier diets rich in legumes, fruits, and vegetables, environmental and health cobenefits could be realized. The aforementioned ACP Climate Change Action Plan includes a document summarizing how the health care sector can reduce its greenhouse gas footprint by eliminating waste and encouraging consumption of healthy, local foods."
166;Extreme Weather and Climate Change: Population Health and Health System Implications.;Extreme weather and climate events, such as heat waves, cyclones, and floods, are an expression of climate variability. These events and events influenced by climate change, such as wildfires, continue to cause significant human morbidity and mortality and adversely affect mental health and well-being. Although adverse health impacts from extreme events declined over the past few decades, climate change and more people moving into harm's way could alter this trend. Long-term changes to Earth's energy balance are increasing the frequency and intensity of many extreme events and the probability of compound events, with trends projected to accelerate under certain greenhouse gas emissions scenarios. While most of these events cannot be completely avoided, many of the health risks could be prevented through building climate-resilient health systems with improved risk reduction, preparation, response, and recovery. Conducting vulnerability and adaptation assessments and developing health system adaptation plans can identify priority actions to effectively reduce risks, such as disaster risk management and more resilient infrastructure. The risks are urgent, so action is needed now. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 42 is April 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
167;Community-based Participatory Process – Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program for Northern First Nations and Inuit in Canada;"Objectives: Health Canada's Program for Climate Change and Health Adaptation in Northern First Nation and Inuit Communities is unique among Canadian federal programs in that it enables community-based participatory research by northern communities. Study design: The program was designed to build capacity by funding communities to conduct their own research in cooperation with Aboriginal associations, academics, and governments; that way, communities could develop health-related adaptation plans and communication materials that would help in adaptation decision-making at the community, regional, national and circumpolar levels with respect to human health and a changing environment. Methods: Community visits and workshops were held to familiarize northerners with the impacts of climate change on their health, as well as methods to develop research proposals and budgets to meet program requirements. Results: Since the launch of the Climate Change and Health Adaptation Program in 2008, Health Canada has funded 36 community projects across Canada's North that focus on relevant health issues caused by climate change. In addition, the program supported capacity-building workshops for northerners, as well as a Pan-Arctic Results Workshop to bring communities together to showcase the results of their research. Results include: numerous films and photo-voice products that engage youth and elders and are available on the web; community-based ice monitoring, surveillance and communication networks; and information products on land, water and ice safety, drinking water, food security and safety, and traditional medicine. Conclusions: Through these efforts, communities have increased their knowledge and understanding of the health effects related to climate change and have begun to develop local adaptation strategies."
168;Impediments to Comprehensive Research on Climate Change and Health;"During every climatic era Life on Earth is constrained by a limited range of climatic conditions, outside which thriving and then surviving becomes difficult. This applies at both planetary and organism (species) levels. Further, many causal influences of climate change on human health entail changes—often disruptive, sometimes irreversible—in complex system functioning. Understanding the diverse health risks from climate change, and their influence pathways, presents a challenge to environmental health researchers whose prior work has been in a more definable, specific and quantitative milieu. Extension of the research agenda and conceptual framework to assess present and future health risks from climate change may be constrained by three factors: (i) lack of historically-informed understanding of population-health sensitivity to climatic changes; (ii) an instinctual ‘epidemiologising’ tendency to choose research topics amenable to conventional epidemiological analysis and risk estimation; and (iii) under-confidence in relation to interdisciplinary collaborative scenario-based modeling of future health risks. These constraints must be recognized and remedied. And environmental researchers must argue for heightened public attention to today’s macro-environmental threats to present and future population health—emphasising the ecological dimension of these determinants of long-term health that apply to whole populations and communities, not just to individuals and social groupings."
169;Climate change and global health: A call to more research and more action;There is increasing understanding, globally, that climate change and increased pollution will have a profound and mostly harmful effect on human health. This review brings together international experts to describe both the direct (such as heat waves) and indirect (such as vector‐borne disease incidence) health impacts of climate change. These impacts vary depending on vulnerability (i.e., existing diseases) and the international, economic, political, and environmental context. This unique review also expands on these issues to address a third category of potential longer‐term impacts on global health: famine, population dislocation, and environmental justice and education. This scholarly resource explores these issues fully, linking them to global health in urban and rural settings in developed and developing countries. The review finishes with a practical discussion of action that health professionals around the world in our field can yet take.
170;The impact of climate change on food systems, diet quality, nutrition, and health outcomes: A narrative review;Many consequences of climate change undermine the stability of global food systems, decreasing food security and diet quality, and exposing vulnerable populations to multiple forms of malnutrition. The emergence of pandemics such as Covid-19 exacerbate the situation and make interactions even more complex. Climate change impacts food systems at different levels, including changes in soil fertility and crop yield, composition, and bioavailability of nutrients in foods, pest resistance, and risk of malnutrition. Sustainable and resilient food systems, coupled with climate-smart agriculture, are needed to ensure sustainable diets that are adequately diverse, nutritious, and better aligned with contextual ecosystem functions and environmental conservation. Robust tools and indicators are urgently needed to measure the reciprocal food systems-climate change interaction, that is further complicated by pandemics, and how it impacts human health.
171;Impacts of Climate Change and Heat Stress on Farmworkers' Health: A Scoping Review;Due to the continuous rise of global temperatures and heatwaves worldwide as a result of climate change, concerns for the health and safety of working populations have increased. Workers in the food production chain, particularly farmworkers, are especially vulnerable to heat stress due to the strenuous nature of their work, which is performed primarily outdoors under poor working conditions. At the cross-section of climate change and farmworkers' health, a scoping review was undertaken to summarize the existing knowledge regarding the health impacts associated with climate change and heat stress, guide future research toward better understanding current and future climate change risks, and inform policies to protect the health and safety of agricultural workers. A systematic search of 5 electronic databases and gray literature websites was conducted to identify relevant literature published up until December 2021. A total of 9045 records were retrieved from the searches, of which 92 articles were included in the final review. The majority of the reviewed articles focused on heat-related illnesses (n = 57) and kidney diseases (n = 28). The risk factors identified in the reviewed studies included gender, dehydration, heat strain, wearing inappropriate clothing, workload, piece-rate payment, job decision latitude, and hot environmental conditions. On the other hand, various protective and preventive factors were identified including drinking water, changing work hours and schedule of activities, wearing appropriate clothing, reducing soda consumption, taking breaks in shaded or air-conditioned areas, and increasing electrolyte consumption in addition to improving access to medical care. This review also identified various factors that are unique to vulnerable agricultural populations, including migrant and child farmworkers. Our findings call for an urgent need to expand future research on vulnerable agricultural communities including migrant workers so as to develop effective policies and interventions that can protect these communities from the effects of heat stress.
172;Reflections on Climate Change and Public Health in Africa in an Era of Global Pandemic;The study examined the impact of climate change on public health provisioning in Sub-Saharan Africa. In addition to recognising the multifarious influence of climate change on health, it argues that the quest for global health security can only be achieved against the backdrop of concerted mainstreaming of climate change response into public heath provisioning, especially in the developing world. Adapting to climate change and mitigating its impact would logically require integrating it into public health planning, programming and interventions. Therefore, if health security entails provisioning and catering to the full range of health needs of people, climate change given its undoubted implications for health should be in the forefront of health security globally. Despite the global discourse of climate change and health security, tangible actions and programmes at different levels are needed to achieve the goals of good health and effective health security. This is no less the case now that the pandemic has challenged and stretched health institutions and provisions. However, the complex and intertwining effects of climate change and its manifold nexus with public health and health security can easily be apprehended through the systems perspective. There is the need for both radicalization of the public health system in Sub-Saharan Africa and concerted efforts across disciplines and actors to achieve effective climate change mitigation and adaptation and thus further strengthen health security.
173;A Review of Frameworks for Developing Environmental Health Indicators for Climate Change and Health;The role climate change may play in altering human health, particularly in the emergence and spread of diseases, is an evolving area of research. It is important to understand this relationship because it will compound the already significant burden of diseases on national economies and public health. Authorities need to be able to assess, anticipate, and monitor human health vulnerability to climate change, in order to plan for, or implement action to avoid these eventualities. Environmental health indicators (EHIs) provide a tool to assess, monitor, and quantify human health vulnerability, to aid in the design and targeting of interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. Our aim was to identify the most suitable framework for developing EHIs to measure and monitor the impacts of climate change on human health and inform the development of interventions. Using published literature we reviewed the attributes of 11 frameworks. We identified the Driving force-Pressure-State-Exposure-Effect-Action (DPSEEA) framework as the most suitable one for developing EHIs for climate change and health. We propose the use of EHIs as a valuable tool to assess, quantify, and monitor human health vulnerability, design and target interventions, and measure the effectiveness of climate change adaptation and mitigation activities. In this paper, we lay the groundwork for the future development of EHIs as a multidisciplinary approach to link existing environmental and epidemiological data and networks. Analysis of such data will contribute to an enhanced understanding of the relationship between climate change and human health.
174;Climate Change and Health in the Urban Environment: Adaptation Opportunities in Australian Cities;Urban populations are growing rapidly throughout the Asia-Pacific region. Cities are vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change because of their concentration of people and infrastructure, the physical (geographical, material, and structural) attributes of the built environment, and the ecological interdependence with the urban ecosystem. Australia is one of the most highly urbanized countries in the region and its already variable climate is set to become hotter and drier with climate change. Climate change in Australia is expected to increase morbidity and mortality from thermal stress, bacterial gastroenteritis, vector-borne disease, air pollution, flooding, and bushfires. The cost and availability of fresh water, food, and energy will also likely be affected. The more vulnerable urban populations, including the elderly, socioeconomically disadvantaged groups, and those with underlying chronic disease, will be most affected. Adaptation strategies need to address this underlying burden of disease and inequity as well as implement broad structural changes to building codes and urban design, and infrastructure capacity. In doing so, cities provide opportunities to realize “co-benefits” for health (eg, from increased levels of physical activity and improved air quality). With evidence that climate change is underway, the need for cities to be a focus in the development of climate adaptation strategies is becoming more urgent.
175;Climate change and health research: has it served rural communities?;INTRODUCTION If climate change is the 21st Century's biggest public health threat, research faces the major challenge of providing adequate evidence for vulnerable communities to adapt to the health effects of climate change. Available information about best practice in climate adaptation suggests it is inclusive of socio-economic disadvantage and local community factors such as access to health services. Since 1995, at least 19 164 papers have been published on climate change in the health sciences and social sciences. This body of literature has not yet been systematically examined for how well it serves rural communities.   METHODS The ultimate aim of the study was to contribute to better understandings about what climate adaptation research has been done and is needed for rural communities. The two research questions were: 'What kinds of content define climate change research in disciplines that could potentially contribute to adaptation for health?' and 'How is content about rural and Aboriginal communities and best practice in adaptation related to this content?' A quantitative content analysis was performed using 'computational linguistics' Leximancer software. The analysis included 19 164 health and social sciences abstracts, batched by years, from 1 January 1995 to 31 July 2012. The relative frequency and co-occurrence of 52 concepts in these abstracts were mapped, as well as associations with positive or negative sentiment for selected concepts.   RESULTS Aboriginal' concepts tend to be relatively infrequent (3% and 5% overall likelihood of occurrence, respectively) and are more associated with socio-economic concepts in the social sciences than the health sciences. Multiple concepts in the health sciences literature are typically connected with 'disease' and ultimately 'science' storylines, with a 38% likelihood of paired co-occurrence of 'health' and 'disease' concepts alone. The social sciences appear more focused on the local and particular issues of community in climate change than the health sciences. 'Rural' and 'Aboriginal' concepts have increased by 1% across both discipline areas, since 2011 for the 'rural' concept and since 2004 for the 'Aboriginal' concept. 'Health' concepts in the health sciences and 'economic' concepts in the social sciences, as well as 'urban' concepts, are referred to more positively than either the 'rural' or 'Aboriginal' concepts.   CONCLUSIONS While care needs to be taken in interpreting the results of this study too negatively for rural and Aboriginal communities, they suggest that a disease focus dominates climate and health research typically unconnected to wider socio-economic and human system factors. This finding needs to be considered in light of the accumulating evidence of the importance of such contextual systemic factors in understanding climate and health effects and responses. The study adds some support to the view that a key priority is bringing the learnings of applied community-based researchers, from those in rural health to those in the social sciences, to climate research. There is a need to build confidence, including in the rural health sector which has arguably been slow to participate in programs of climate change research, that community-based research could make a difference to rural health in a climate-changing world.
176;Bibliometric analysis of peer-reviewed literature on climate change and human health with an emphasis on infectious diseases;"Background Assessing research activity is important for planning future protective and adaptive policies. The objective of the current study was to assess research activity on climate change and health with an emphasis on infectious diseases. Method A bibliometric method was applied using SciVerse Scopus. Documents on climate change and human health were called “health-related literature” while documents on climate change and infectious diseases were called “infection-related literature”. The study period was from 1980 to 2019. Results The search query found 4247 documents in the health-related literature and 1207 in the infection-related literature. The growth of publications showed a steep increase after 2007. There were four research themes in the health-related literature: (1) climate change and infectious diseases; (2) climate change, public health and food security; (3) heat waves, mortality, and non-communicable diseases; and (4) climate change, air pollution, allergy, and respiratory health. The most frequently encountered pathogens/infectious diseases in the infection-related literature were malaria and dengue. Documents in infection-related literature had a higher h -index than documents in the health-related literature. The top-cited documents in the health-related literature focused on food security, public health, and infectious diseases while those in infection-related literature focused on water-, vector-, and mosquito-borne diseases. The European region had the highest contribution in health-related literature ( n  = 1626; 38.3%) and infection-related literature ( n  = 497; 41.2%). The USA led with 1235 (29.1%) documents in health-related literature and 365 (30.2%) documents in infection-related literature. The Australian National University ranked first in the health-related literature while the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine ranked first in the infection-related literature. International research collaboration was inadequate. Documents published in the Environmental Health Perspectives journal received the highest citations per document. A total of 1416 (33.3%) documents in the health-related literature were funded while 419 (34.7%) documents in the infection-related literature were funded. Conclusion Research on climate change and human health is on the rise with research on infection-related issues making a good share. International research collaboration should be funded and supported. Future research needs to focus on the impact of climate change on psychosocial, mental, innovations, policies, and preparedness of health systems."
177;Climate change and health risks: assessing and responding to them through 'adaptive management'.;Climate change and associated changing weather patterns, including severe weather events, are expected to increase the prevalence of a wide range of health risks. Yet there is uncertainty about the timing, location, and severity of these changes. Adaptive management, a structured process of decision making in the face of imperfect information, is an approach that can help the public health field effectively anticipate, plan for, and respond to the health risks of climate change. In this article I describe adaptive management and how it could increase the effectiveness of local and national strategies, policies, and programs to manage climate-sensitive health outcomes.
178;Climate change and health: global to local influences on disease risk;"Abstract The World Health Organization has concluded that the climatic changes that have occurred since the mid 1970s could already be causing annually over 150,000 deaths and five million disability-adjusted life-years (DALY), mainly in developing countries. The less developed countries are, ironically, those least responsible for causing global warming. Many health outcomes and diseases are sensitive to climate, including: heat-related mortality or morbidity; air pollution-related illnesses; infectious diseases, particularly those transmitted, indirectly, via water or by insect or rodent vectors; and refugee health issues linked to forced population migration. Yet, changing landscapes can significantly affect local weather more acutely than long-term climate change. Land-cover change can influence micro-climatic conditions, including temperature, evapo-transpiration and surface run-off, that are key determinants in the emergence of many infectious diseases. To improve risk assessment and risk management of these synergistic processes (climate and land-use change), more collaborative efforts in research, training and policy-decision support, across the fields of health, environment, sociology and economics, are required."

180;Climate Change and Mental Health: A Scoping Review;"Climate change is negatively impacting the mental health of populations. This scoping review aims to assess the available literature related to climate change and mental health across the World Health Organisation’s (WHO) five global research priorities for protecting human health from climate change. We conducted a scoping review to identify original research studies related to mental health and climate change using online academic databases. We assessed the quality of studies where appropriate assessment tools were available. We identified 120 original studies published between 2001 and 2020. Most studies were quantitative (n = 67), cross-sectional (n = 42), conducted in high-income countries (n = 87), and concerned with the first of the WHO global research priorities—assessing the mental health risks associated with climate change (n = 101). Several climate-related exposures, including heat, humidity, rainfall, drought, wildfires, and floods were associated with psychological distress, worsened mental health, and higher mortality among people with pre-existing mental health conditions, increased psychiatric hospitalisations, and heightened suicide rates. Few studies (n = 19) addressed the other four global research priorities of protecting health from climate change (effective interventions (n = 8); mitigation and adaptation (n = 7); improving decision-support (n = 3); and cost estimations (n = 1)). While climate change and mental health represents a rapidly growing area of research, it needs to accelerate and broaden in scope to respond with evidence-based mitigation and adaptation strategies."
181;An expert assessment on climate change and health – with a European focus on lungs and allergies;"BackgroundFor almost 20 years, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has been assessing the potential health risks associated with climate change; with increasingly convincing evidence that climate change presents existing impacts on human health. In industrialized countries climate change may further affect public health and in particular respiratory health, through existing health stressors, including, anticipated increased number of deaths and acute morbidity due to heat waves; increased frequency of cardiopulmonary events due to higher concentrations of air pollutants; and altered spatial and temporal distribution of allergens and some infectious disease vectors. Additionally exposure to moulds and contaminants from water damaged buildings may increase.MethodsWe undertook an expert elicitation amongst European researchers engaged in environmental medicine or respiratory health. All experts were actively publishing researchers on lung disease and air pollution, climate and health or a closely related research. We conducted an online questionnaire on proposed causal diagrams and determined levels of confidence that climate change will have an impact on a series of stressors. In a workshop following the online questionnaire, half of the experts further discussed the results and reasons for differences in assessments of the state of knowledge on exposures and health effects.ResultsOut of 16 experts, 100% expressed high to very high confidence that climate change would increase the frequency of heat waves. At least half expressed high or very high confidence that climate change would increase levels of pollen (50%), particulate matter (PM2.5) (55%), and ozone (70%). While clarity is needed around the impacts of increased exposures to health impacts of some stressors, including ozone and particulate matter levels, it was noted that definitive knowledge is not a prerequisite for policy action. Information to the public, preventive measures, monitoring and warning systems were among the most commonly mentioned preventative actions.ConclusionsThis group of experts identifies clear health risks associated with climate change, and express opinions about these risks even while they do not necessarily regard themselves as covering all areas of expertise. Since some changes in exposure have already been observed, the consensus is that there is already a scientific basis for preventative action, and that the associated adaptation and mitigation policies should also be evidence based."
182;Climate change and health: impacts, vulnerability, adaptation and mitigation.;Global climate change is progressing and health impacts have been observed in a number of countries, including Australia. The main health impacts will be due to direct heat exposure, extreme weather, air pollution, reduced local food production, food- and vectorborne infectious diseases and mental stress. The issue is one of major public health importance. Adaptation to reduce the effects of climate change involves many different sectors to minimise negative health outcomes. Wide-scale mitigation is also required, in order to reduce the effects of climate change. In addition, future urban design must be modified to mitigate and adapt to the effects of climate change. Strategies for mitigation and adaptation can create co-benefits for both individual and community health, by reducing non-climate-related health hazard exposures and by encouraging health promoting behaviours and lifestyles.
183;Climate change and health effects in Northwest Alaska;This article provides examples of adverse health effects, including weather-related injury, food insecurity, mental health issues, and water infrastructure damage, and the responses to these effects that are currently being applied in two Northwest Alaska communities. Background In Northwest Alaska, warming is resulting in a broad range of unusual weather and environmental conditions, including delayed freeze-up, earlier breakup, storm surge, coastal erosion, and thawing permafrost. These are just some of the climate impacts that are driving concerns about weather-related injury, the spread of disease, mental health issues, infrastructure damage, and food and water security. Local leaders are challenged to identify appropriate adaptation strategies to address climate impacts and related health effects. Implementation process The tribal health system is combining local observations, traditional knowledge, and western science to perform community-specific climate change health impact assessments. Local leaders are applying this information to develop adaptation responses. Objective The Alaska Native Tribal Health Consortium will describe relationships between climate impacts and health effects and provide examples of community-scaled adaptation actions currently being applied in Northwest Alaska. Findings Climate change is increasing vulnerability to injury, disease, mental stress, food insecurity, and water insecurity. Northwest communities are applying adaptation approaches that are both specific and appropriate. Conclusion The health impact assessment process is effective in raising awareness, encouraging discussion, engaging partners, and implementing adaptation planning. With community-specific information, local leaders are applying health protective adaptation measures.
184;Air Pollution, Climate Change, and Human Health in Indian Cities: A Brief Review;Climate change and air pollution have been a matter of serious concern all over the world in the last few decades. The present review has been carried out in this concern over the Indian cities with significant impacts of both the climate change and air pollution on human health. The expanding urban areas with extreme climate events (high rainfall, extreme temperature, floods, and droughts) are posing human health risks. The intensified heat waves as a result of climate change have led to the elevation in temperature levels causing thermal discomfort and several health issues to urban residents. The study also covers the increasing air pollution levels above the prescribed standards for most of the Indian megacities. The aerosols and PM concentrations have been explored and hazardous health impacts of particles that are inhaled by humans and enter the respiratory system have also been discussed. The air quality during COVID-2019 lockdown in Indian cities with its health impacts has also been reviewed. Finally, the correlation between climate change, air pollution, and urbanizations has been presented as air pollutants (such as aerosols) affect the climate of Earth both directly (by absorption and scattering) and indirectly (by altering the cloud properties and radiation transfer processes). So, the present review will serve as a baseline data for policy makers in analyzing vulnerable regions and implementing mitigation plans for tackling air pollution. The adaptation and mitigation measures can be taken based on the review in Indian cities to reciprocate human health impacts by regular air pollution monitoring and addressing climate change as well.
185;Climate Change and Radiology: Impetus for Change and a Toolkit for Action.;This special report discusses the importance of climate change for health care and radiology. The impact of climate change on human health and health equity, the contribution of health care and medical imaging to the climate crisis, and the impetus for change within radiology to create a more sustainable future are covered. The authors focus on actions and opportunities to address climate change in our role as radiologists. A toolkit highlights actions we can take toward a more sustainable future, linking each action with the expected impact and outcome. This toolkit includes a hierarchy of actions from first steps to advocating for system-level change. This includes actions we can take in our daily lives, in radiology departments and professional organizations, and in our relationships with vendors and industry partners. As radiologists, we are adept at managing rapid technological change, which makes us ideally suited to lead these initiatives. Alignment of incentives and synergies with health systems are highlighted given that many of the proposed strategies also result in cost savings.
186;Climate change and mental health: risks, impacts and priority actions;"BackgroundThis article provides an overview of the current and projected climate change risks and impacts to mental health and provides recommendations for priority actions to address the mental health consequences of climate change.Discussion and conclusionThe authors argue the following three points: firstly, while attribution of mental health outcomes to specific climate change risks remains challenging, there are a number of opportunities available to advance the field of mental health and climate change with more empirical research in this domain; secondly, the risks and impacts of climate change on mental health are already rapidly accelerating, resulting in a number of direct, indirect, and overarching effects that disproportionally affect those who are most marginalized; and, thirdly, interventions to address climate change and mental health need to be coordinated and rooted in active hope in order to tackle the problem in a holistic manner. This discussion paper concludes with recommendations for priority actions to address the mental health consequences of climate change."
187;Climate change and health: Why should India be concerned?;Overwhelming evidence shows that climate change presents growing threats to public health security – from extreme weather-related disasters to wider spread of such vector-borne diseases as malaria and dengue. The impacts of climate on human health will not be evenly distributed around the world. The Third Assessment Report (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change-2001) concluded that vulnerability to climate change is a function of exposure, sensitivity, and adaptive capacity. Developing country populations, particularly in small island states, arid and high mountain zones, and in densely populated coastal areas are considered to be particularly vulnerable. India is a large developing country, with the Great Himalayas, the world's third largest ice mass in the north, 7500 km long, and densely populated coast line in the south. Nearly 700 million of her over one billion population living in rural areas directly depends on climate-sensitive sectors (agriculture, forests, and fisheries) and natural resources (such as water, biodiversity, mangroves, coastal zones, grasslands) for their subsistence and livelihoods. Heat wave, floods (land and coastal), and draughts occur commonly. Malaria, malnutrition, and diarrhea are major public health problems. Any further increase, as projected in weather-related disasters and related health effects, may cripple the already inadequate public health infrastructure in the country. Hence, there is an urgent need to respond to the situation. Response options to protect health from effects of climate change include mitigation as well as adaptation. Both can complement each other and together can significantly reduce the risks of climate change.
188;Climate Change and Cardiovascular Health;Climate change— which encompasses the longterm changes in temperature and weather patterns seen since the Industrial Revolution attributed in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases— is increasingly recognized for its farreaching consequences on human health.1 The consequences of fossil fuel combustion that range from air pollution to extreme heat and to severe weather patterns can translate both directly and indirectly to increases in cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.2 The exposure pathways that link climate change to health outcomes vary based on both geographic context (eg, people living in floodprone areas face different challenges from those living in droughtprone areas) and sociodemographic context (eg, people with limited economic resources may be particularly vulnerable to health impacts of a changing climate for which they lack the resources to overcome the effects). Accordingly, better understanding of the effects of climate change is of increasing importance for clinicians to empower them to develop strategies to reduce its burden on the health of their patients. This article will identify climatesensitive environmental stressors, discuss their effects on cardiovascular health, and review the unique risks faced by vulnerable communities cared for by cardiovascular disease specialists.
189;Climate change, 24-hour movement behaviors, and health: a mini umbrella review;"Background The worsening climate change and alarming prevalence of communicable and non-communicable diseases continue to threat human life and existence. Accumulating evidence suggests that favorable patterns of 24-h movement behaviors, high physical activity, low sedentary behavior, and adequate sleep, may positively contribute to achieving dual benefits of climate change mitigation and disease prevention. The purposes of this mini umbrella review were to summarize the most up-to-date, high-level evidence exploring the relationships between climate change, 24-h movement behaviors, and health and elaborate on the mechanisms linking the three variables of interest. Methods A systematic search of electronic databases was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar during March–October 2020. Inclusion criteria were: (1) systematic review; (2) reviewed relationships between climate change and movement behaviors and/or health in any directions; (3) written in English; (4) published in 2010–2020. Narrative synthesis was conducted to highlight the main relationships observed and address the current state of knowledge and priorities for future research. In order to illustrate the potential mechanisms between climate change, movement behaviors, and health, the main results from included systematic reviews were summarized and a conceptual framework was developed for future research. Results Based on the evidence from eight systematic reviews published in the past decade, multi-directional (i.e., uni-, bi-, or U-shaped) links were observed between climate change and varying human health outcomes. However, little is understood about the association between climate change and 24-h movement behaviors. Two reviews suggested the negative impact of climate change on sleep and bi-directional relationships between climate change and physical activity/sport. One review included two studies suggesting the unfavorable impact of climate change on sedentary behavior; however, the evidence was limited. Finally, no reviews examined the mechanisms by which climate change, movement behaviors, and health impact one another. Based on the findings of this mini umbrella review, a conceptual framework is proposed that could guide future work to unpack mechanisms between climate change, movement behaviors, and health. Conclusions This mini umbrella review highlights the importance of better understanding the mechanisms between climate change, movement behaviors, and health in developing effective mitigation and adaptation strategies to climate change, while paying close attention to vulnerable countries/communities/population groups."
190;Climate Change, Environmental Health, and Challenges for Nursing Discipline;Current data and scientific predictions about the consequences of climate change are accurate in suggesting disaster. Since 2019, climate change has become a threat to human health, and major consequences on health and health systems are already observed. Climate change is a central concern for the nursing discipline, even though nursing theorists’ understanding of the environment has led to problematic gaps that impact the current context. Today, nursing discipline is facing new challenges. Nurses are strategically placed to respond to the impacts of climate change through their practice, research, and training in developing, implementing, and sustaining innovation towards climate change mitigation and adaptation. It is urgent for them to adapt their practice to this reality to become agents of change.
191;Climate Change and Children’s Mental Health: A Developmental Perspective;"Climate change is a major global public-health challenge that will have wide-ranging impacts on human psychological health and well-being. Children and adolescents are at particular risk because of their rapidly developing brain, vulnerability to disease, and limited capacity to avoid or adapt to threats and impacts. They are also more likely to worry about climate change than any other age group. Drawing on a developmental life-course perspective, we show that climate-change-related threats can additively, interactively, and cumulatively increase psychopathology risk from conception onward; that these effects are already occurring; and that they constitute an important threat to healthy human development worldwide. We then argue that monitoring, measuring, and mitigating these risks is a matter of social justice and a crucial long-term investment in developmental and mental health sciences. We conclude with a discussion of conceptual and measurement challenges and outline research priorities going forward."
192;Energy, Poverty, and Health in Climate Change: A Comprehensive Review of an Emerging Literature;Household energy is increasingly vital for maintaining good health. Unaffordable and inadequate household energy presents adverse consequences that are amplified by poverty and a changing climate. To date, the connections between energy, socioeconomic disadvantage, and well-being are generally underappreciated, and household energy connection with climate change is under-researched. Building on the energy insecurity framework, this review explores literature related to household energy, poverty, and health in order to highlight the disproportionate burdens borne by vulnerable populations in adequately meeting household energy needs. This paper is based on a comprehensive review of books, peer-reviewed articles, and reports published between 1990 and 2019, identified via databases including JSTOR and PubMed. A total of 406 publications were selected as having potential for full review, 203 received full review, and 162 were included in this paper on the basis of set inclusion criteria. From the literature review, we created an original heuristic model that describes energy insecurity as either acute or chronic, and we further explore the mediators and pathways that link energy insecurity to health. In the discussion, we posit that the extant literature does not sufficiently consider that vulnerable communities often experience energy insecurity bundled with other hardships. We also discuss energy, poverty, and health through the lens of climate change, making the criticism that most research on household energy does not consider climate change. This evidence is important for enhancing research in this field and developing programmatic and policy interventions as they pertain to energy access, affordability, and health, with special emphasis on vulnerable populations, climate change, and social inequality.
193;Climate Change and Human Health ECHO: Global Telementoring for Health Professionals;OBJECTIVE To increase the knowledge and communication skills of health professionals related to climate change and human health (CCHH). METHODS From February to April 2021, Project ECHO (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes) created an 8-week, synchronous and virtual, CCHH ECHO telementoring series for health professionals. Didactics, simulated cases, and climate change tools were used to educate the interprofessional group of participants. RESULTS During this CCHH ECHO pilot series, 625 unique participants represented 45 US states and 25 countries. The participants reported that they increased their knowledge, skills, and communication techniques regarding climate change and health. CONCLUSIONS The human health effects of climate change is an emerging field, and increasing knowledge and communication skills among health practitioners is of critical importance. The CCHH ECHO is one potential platform that may reach a diverse community of health professionals globally due to the diffusion and demonopolization of knowledge.
194;The Implications of Climate Change on Health among Vulnerable Populations in South Africa: A Systematic Review;Climate change poses numerous threats to human life, including physical and mental health, the environment, housing, food security, and economic growth. People who already experience multidimensional poverty with the disparity in social, political, economic, historical, and environmental contexts are more vulnerable to these impacts. The study aims to identify the role of climate change in increasing multidimensional inequalities among vulnerable populations and analyze the strengths and limitations of South Africa’s National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy. A systematic review was applied, and literature from Google, Google Scholar, and PubMed, as well as relevant gray literature from 2014–2022 were reviewed. Out of 854 identified sources, 24 were included in the review. Climate change has exacerbated multidimensional inequalities among vulnerable populations in South Africa. Though the National Climate Change Adaptation Strategy has paid attention to health issues and the needs of vulnerable groups, the adaptation measures appear to focus less on mental and occupational health. Climate change may play a significant role in increasing multidimensional inequalities and exacerbating health consequences among vulnerable populations. For an inclusive and sustainable reduction in inequalities and vulnerabilities to the impact of climate change, community-based health and social services should be enhanced among vulnerable populations.
195;Climate Change and Health in British Columbia: Projected Impacts and a Proposed Agenda for Adaptation Research and Policy;This is a case study describing how climate change may affect the health of British Columbians and to suggest a way forward to promote health and policy research, and adaptation to these changes. After reviewing the limited evidence of the impacts of climate change on human health we have developed five principles to guide the development of research and policy to better predict future impacts of climate change on health and to enhance adaptation to these change in BC. We suggest that, with some modification, these principles will be useful to policy makers in other jurisdictions.
196;Addressing Climate Change and Its Effects on Human Health: A Call to Action for Medical Schools.;Human health is increasingly threatened by rapid and widespread changes in the environment and climate, including rising temperatures, air and water pollution, disease vector migration, floods, and droughts. In the United States, many medical schools, the American Medical Association, and the National Academy of Sciences have published calls for physicians and physicians-in-training to develop a basic knowledge of the science of climate change and an awareness of the associated health risks. The authors--all medical students and educators--argue for the expeditious redesign of medical school curricula to teach students to recognize, diagnose, and treat the many health conditions exacerbated by climate change as well as understanding public health issues. In this Invited Commentary, the authors briefly review the health impacts of climate change, examine current climate change course offerings and proposals, and describe the rationale for promptly and comprehensively including climate science education in medical school curricula. Efforts in training physicians now will benefit those physicians' communities, whose health will be impacted by a period of remarkable climate change. The bottom line is that the health effects of climate reality cannot be ignored, and people everywhere must adapt as quickly as possible.
197;Climate Change, Water Scarcity, and Health Adaptation in Southwestern Coastal Bangladesh;Climate change may affect human health through multiple and interactive pathways that include safe water scarcity. However, impacts of climate change-induced water scarcity on health and well-being are complex. About 80% of illnesses in developing countries are attributed to unsafe drinking water and waterborne diseases. In Southwestern Bangladesh, lack of safe drinking water is a severe crisis due to climate change. The study investigated the impacts of climate change on water resources and human health in a coastal area. A questionnaire survey was carried out in two villages of Shymnagar upazila on the southwestern coast to investigate the present status of safe water sources and health care facilities and their impacts on the local community. The results show that the local community believes that climate change is having substantial impacts on freshwater sources and health. More than 70% of the respondents identified diarrhea, dysentery, and skin diseases as the prime waterborne health risks that occur through climate-related safe water scarcity. By synthesizing the ground data, we suggest pathways to health adaptation to climate change effects and safe water scarcity through locally available adaptive practices such as the use of pond sand filters, rainwater harvesting, and importing potable water with the active participation of the government, nongovernmental organizations, and communities.
198;Climate Change and Child Health Inequality: A Review of Reviews;"There is growing evidence on the observed and expected consequences of climate change on population health worldwide. There is limited understanding of its consequences for child health inequalities, between and within countries. To examine these consequences and categorize the state of knowledge in this area, we conducted a review of reviews indexed in five databases (Medline, Embase, Web of Science, PsycInfo, Sociological Abstracts). Reviews that reported the effect of climate change on child health inequalities between low- and high-income children, within or between countries (high- vs low–middle-income countries; HICs and LMICs), were included. Twenty-three reviews, published between 2007 and January 2021, were included for full-text analyses. Using thematic synthesis, we identified strong descriptive, but limited quantitative, evidence that climate change exacerbates child health inequalities. Explanatory mechanisms relating climate change to child health inequalities were proposed in some reviews; for example, children in LMICs are more susceptible to the consequences of climate change than children in HICs due to limited structural and economic resources. Geographic and intergenerational inequalities emerged as additional themes from the review. Further research with an equity focus should address the effects of climate change on adolescents/youth, mental health and inequalities within countries."
199;Ethical considerations regarding the effects of climate change and planetary health on children;Climate change represents one of the most significant health challenges and global inequities of our generation. As a ‘wicked’ problem, climate change imposes an involuntary exposure on vulnerable individuals and societies that is regressive in its nature, with those least responsible for destroying planetary health at greatest risk of suffering the direct and indirect health consequences of unabated warming of the planet. The current and future generations of children are the most vulnerable population to suffer the effects of climate change. By 2030, there will be 131 000 additional child deaths each year if climate mitigation strategies are not enacted, driven by the synergy of an increasing burden of infectious diseases, food insecurity and political instability. Over half a billion of the world's children live in areas vulnerable to extreme weather events, and there is a pressing risk that our current lack of action to mitigate and adapt to climate change will result in today's children, and future generations, being the first to have poorer physical and mental health than previous generations – creating a significant intergenerational ethical dilemma. Child health‐care professionals need to advocate for policies to address climate change that consider the complex health, planetary and ethical considerations necessary to solve the most significant risk to our children's health today. Without immediate action, the health of the current and future generations of children is perilous.
200;Climate Change Risks to Global Forest Health: Emergence of Unexpected Events of Elevated Tree Mortality Worldwide.;Recent observations of elevated tree mortality following climate extremes, like heat and drought, raise concerns about climate change risks to global forest health. We currently lack both sufficient data and understanding to identify whether these observations represent a global trend toward increasing tree mortality. Here, we document events of sudden and unexpected elevated tree mortality following heat and drought events in ecosystems that previously were considered tolerant or not at risk of exposure. These events underscore the fact that climate change may affect forests with unexpected force in the future. We use the events as examples to highlight current difficulties and challenges for realistically predicting such tree mortality events and the uncertainties about future forest condition. Advances in remote sensing technology and greater availably of high-resolution data, from both field assessments and from satellites, are needed to improve both understanding and prediction of forest responses to future climate change. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Plant Biology, Volume 73 is May 2022. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
201;Climate Change and Human Health: A Review of Allergies, Autoimmunity and the Microbiome;The impact of climate change on human health is a topic of critical importance. While only recently beginning to gain attention, it is clear that immediate action is necessary to minimize this impact. In our review, we will outline a subset of these effects in detail. We will examine how climate change has worsened respiratory allergic disease. We will discuss how climate change has altered antigen exposure, possibly disrupting antigen-specific tolerance by the immune system, leading, in turn, to an increase in the prevalence of immunologic diseases. Finally, we will explore how the loss of biodiversity related to climate change may affect the microbiome, potentially leading to dysbiosis, inflammatory, autoimmune and neurologic diseases.
202;Health Implications of Climate Change: a Review of the Literature About the Perception of the Public and Health Professionals;Through a systematic search of English language peer-reviewed studies, we assess how health professionals and the public, worldwide, perceive the health implications of climate change. Among health professionals, perception that climate change is harming health appears to be high, although self-assessed knowledge is low, and perceived need to learn more is high. Among the public, few North Americans can list any health impacts of climate change, or who is at risk, but appear to view climate change as harmful to health. Among vulnerable publics in Asia and Africa, awareness of increasing health harms due to specific changing climatic conditions is high. Americans across the political and climate change opinion spectra appear receptive to information about the health aspects of climate change, although findings are mixed. Health professionals feel the need to learn more, and the public appears open to learning more, about the health consequences of climate change.
203;Climate change and Indigenous Health Promotion;Climate change poses a serious threat to the health and well-being of Indigenous peoples around the world. Despite living in diverse contexts, Indigenous peoples face a number of common challenges. Disproportionate threats from climate change exist due to a range of factors including unique relationships with the natural environment, socioeconomic deprivation, a greater existing burden of disease, poorer access to and quality of health care, and political marginalization. Responses to climate change at global, national, and local levels also threaten Indigenous people’s rights. While climate action presents many opportunities to improve health and reduce inequities, there is also significant potential for climate mitigation and adaptation policies to inflict harm on Indigenous peoples. An important aspect of this is the impact on traditional lands, which are acknowledged as a fundamental determinant of Indigenous health and well-being. This article seeks to elucidate the relationships between climate change and Indigenous health and to inform health promotion solutions to achieve climate justice for Indigenous peoples. The underpinning analysis is founded on a Kaupapa Māori positioning, which seeks transformative change and involves critiquing Western knowledges and structures that undermine Indigenous rights. A central theme is that anthropogenic climate change is intimately connected to the ideologies, systems and practices of colonialism, and that the impacts on Indigenous peoples can be conceptualized as an intensification of the process of colonization. It is not possible to understand and address climate-related health impacts for Indigenous peoples without examining this broader context of colonial oppression, marginalization and dispossession. The challenge for health promotion is to engage in a process of decolonization. This involves deconstructing its own systems and practices to avoid reinforcing colonialism and perpetuating inequities. It also requires health promotion practitioners to support Indigenous self-determination and recognize Indigenous knowledges as a critical foundation for climate change and health solutions.
204;How Antimicrobial Resistance Is Linked to Climate Change: An Overview of Two Intertwined Global Challenges;Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and climate change (CC) are two of the top health emergencies, and can be considered as two interlinked public health priorities. The complex commonalities between AMR and CC should be deeply investigated in a One Health perspective. Here, we provided an overview of the current knowledge about the relationship between AMR and CC. Overall, the studies included pointed out the need for applying a systemic approach to planetary health. Firstly, CC increasingly brings humans and animals into contact, leading to outbreaks of zoonotic and vector-borne diseases with pandemic potential. Although it is well-established that antimicrobial use in human, animal and environmental sectors is one of the main drivers of AMR, the COVID-19 pandemic is exacerbating the current scenario, by influencing the use of antibiotics, personal protective equipment, and biocides. This also results in higher concentrations of contaminants (e.g., microplastics) in natural water bodies, which cannot be completely removed from wastewater treatment plants, and which could sustain the AMR spread. Our overview underlined the lack of studies on the direct relationship between AMR and CC, and encouraged further research to investigate the multiple aspects involved, and its effect on human health.
205;Tracking the impacts of climate change on human health via indicators: lessons from the Lancet Countdown;Background In the past decades, climate change has been impacting human lives and health via extreme weather and climate events and alterations in labour capacity, food security, and the prevalence and geographical distribution of infectious diseases across the globe. Climate change and health indicators (CCHIs) are workable tools designed to capture the complex set of interdependent interactions through which climate change is affecting human health. Since 2015, a novel sub-set of CCHIs, focusing on climate change impacts, exposures, and vulnerability indicators (CCIEVIs) has been developed, refined, and integrated by Working Group 1 of the “ Lancet Countdown: Tracking Progress on Health and Climate Change”, an international collaboration across disciplines that include climate, geography, epidemiology, occupation health, and economics. Discussion This research in practice article is a reflective narrative documenting how we have developed CCIEVIs as a discrete set of quantifiable indicators that are updated annually to provide the most recent picture of climate change’s impacts on human health. In our experience, the main challenge was to define globally relevant indicators that also have local relevance and as such can support decision making across multiple spatial scales. We found a hazard, exposure, and vulnerability framework to be effective in this regard. We here describe how we used such a framework to define CCIEVIs based on both data availability and the indicators’ relevance to climate change and human health. We also report on how CCIEVIs have been improved and added to, detailing the underlying data and methods, and in doing so provide the defining quality criteria for Lancet Countdown CCIEVIs. Conclusions Our experience shows that CCIEVIs can effectively contribute to a world-wide monitoring system that aims to track, communicate, and harness evidence on climate-induced health impacts towards effective intervention strategies. An ongoing challenge is how to improve CCIEVIs so that the description of the linkages between climate change and human health can become more and more comprehensive.
206;The Holistic Effects of Climate Change on the Culture, Well-Being, and Health of the Saami, the Only Indigenous People in the European Union;"Purpose of Review(1) To develop a framework for understanding the holistic effects of climate change on the Saami people; (2) to summarize the scientific evidence about the primary, secondary, and tertiary effects of climate change on Saami culture and Sápmi region; and (3) to identify gaps in the knowledge of the effects of climate change on health and well-being of the Saami.Recent FindingsThe Saami health is on average similar, or slightly better compared to the health of other populations in the same area. Warming climate has already influenced Saami reindeer culture. Mental health and suicide risk partly linked to changing physical and social environments are major concerns.SummaryThe lifestyle, diet, and morbidity of the Saami are changing to resemble the majority populations posing threats for the health of the Saami and making them more vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. Climate change is a threat for the cultural way of life of Saami. Possibilities for Saami to adapt to climate change are limited."
207;Health effects of climate change: an overview of systematic reviews;"Objectives We aimed to develop a systematic synthesis of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change, by synthesising studies’ characteristics, climate impacts, health outcomes and key findings. Design We conducted an overview of systematic reviews of health impacts of climate change. We registered our review in PROSPERO (CRD42019145972). No ethical approval was required since we used secondary data. Additional data are not available. Data sources On 22 June 2019, we searched Medline, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Embase, Cochrane and Web of Science. Eligibility criteria We included systematic reviews that explored at least one health impact of climate change. Data extraction and synthesis We organised systematic reviews according to their key characteristics, including geographical regions, year of publication and authors’ affiliations. We mapped the climate effects and health outcomes being studied and synthesised major findings. We used a modified version of A MeaSurement Tool to Assess systematic Reviews-2 (AMSTAR-2) to assess the quality of studies. Results We included 94 systematic reviews. Most were published after 2015 and approximately one-fifth contained meta-analyses. Reviews synthesised evidence about five categories of climate impacts; the two most common were meteorological and extreme weather events. Reviews covered 10 health outcome categories; the 3 most common were (1) infectious diseases, (2) mortality and (3) respiratory, cardiovascular or neurological outcomes. Most reviews suggested a deleterious impact of climate change on multiple adverse health outcomes, although the majority also called for more research. Conclusions Most systematic reviews suggest that climate change is associated with worse human health. This study provides a comprehensive higher order summary of research on health impacts of climate change. Study limitations include possible missed relevant reviews, no meta-meta-analyses, and no assessment of overlap. Future research could explore the potential explanations between these associations to propose adaptation and mitigation strategies and could include broader sociopsychological health impacts of climate change."
208;The Impact of Climate Change on Mental Health: A Systematic Descriptive Review;Background Climate change is one of the great challenges of our time. The consequences of climate change on exposed biological subjects, as well as on vulnerable societies, are a concern for the entire scientific community. Rising temperatures, heat waves, floods, tornadoes, hurricanes, droughts, fires, loss of forest, and glaciers, along with disappearance of rivers and desertification, can directly and indirectly cause human pathologies that are physical and mental. However, there is a clear lack in psychiatric studies on mental disorders linked to climate change. Methods Literature available on PubMed, EMBASE, and Cochrane library until end of June 2019 were reviewed. The total number of articles and association reports was 445. From these, 163 were selected. We looked for the association between classical psychiatric disorders such as anxiety schizophrenia, mood disorder and depression, suicide, aggressive behaviors, despair for the loss of usual landscape, and phenomena related to climate change and extreme weather. Review of literature was then divided into specific areas: the course of change in mental health, temperature, water, air pollution, drought, as well as the exposure of certain groups and critical psychological adaptations. Results Climate change has an impact on a large part of the population, in different geographical areas and with different types of threats to public health. However, the delay in studies on climate change and mental health consequences is an important aspect. Lack of literature is perhaps due to the complexity and novelty of this issue. It has been shown that climate change acts on mental health with different timing. The phenomenology of the effects of climate change differs greatly—some mental disorders are common and others more specific in relation to atypical climatic conditions. Moreover, climate change also affects different population groups who are directly exposed and more vulnerable in their geographical conditions, as well as a lack of access to resources, information, and protection. Perhaps it is also worth underlining that in some papers the connection between climatic events and mental disorders was described through the introduction of new terms, coined only recently: ecoanxiety, ecoguilt, ecopsychology, ecological grief, solastalgia, biospheric concern, etc. Conclusions The effects of climate change can be direct or indirect, short-term or long-term. Acute events can act through mechanisms similar to that of traumatic stress, leading to well-understood psychopathological patterns. In addition, the consequences of exposure to extreme or prolonged weather-related events can also be delayed, encompassing disorders such as posttraumatic stress, or even transmitted to later generations.

210;Climate change anxiety and mental health: Environmental activism as buffer;A growing body of research has documented the phenomenon of climate change anxiety (CCA), defined broadly as negative cognitive, emotional, and behavioral responses associated with concerns about climate change. A recently validated scale of CCA indicated two subscales: cognitive emotional impairment and functional impairment (Clayton & Karazsia, 2020). However, there are few empirical studies on CCA to date and little evidence regarding whether CCA is associated with psychiatric symptoms, including symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD), and whether engaging in individual and collective action to address climate change could buffer such relationships. This mixed methods study draws on data collected from a sample of emerging adult students (ages 18–35) in the United States (N = 284) to address these gaps. Results indicated that both CCA subscales were significantly associated with GAD symptoms, while only the Functional Impairment subscale was associated with higher MDD symptoms. Moreover, engaging in collective action, but not individual action, significantly attenuated the association between CCA cognitive emotional impairment and MDD symptoms. Responses to open-ended questions asking about participants’ worries and actions related to climate change indicated the severity of their worries and, for some, a perception of the insignificance of their actions relative to the enormity of climate change. These results further the field’s understanding of CCA, both in general and specifically among emerging adults, and suggest the importance of creating opportunities for collective action to build sense of agency in addressing climate change.
211;Racial Disparities in Climate Change-Related Health Effects in the United States;Climate change is causing warming over most parts of the USA and more extreme weather events. The health impacts of these changes are not experienced equally. We synthesize the recent evidence that climatic changes linked to global warming are having a disparate impact on the health of people of color, including children. Multiple studies of heat, extreme cold, hurricanes, flooding, and wildfires find evidence that people of color, including Black, Latinx, Native American, Pacific Islander, and Asian communities are at higher risk of climate-related health impacts than Whites, although this is not always the case. Studies of adults have found evidence of racial disparities related to climatic changes with respect to mortality, respiratory and cardiovascular disease, mental health, and heat-related illness. Children are particularly vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change, and infants and children of color have experienced adverse perinatal outcomes, occupational heat stress, and increases in emergency department visits associated with extreme weather. The evidence strongly suggests climate change is an environmental injustice that is likely to exacerbate existing racial disparities across a broad range of health outcomes.
212;The Future of Careers at the Intersection of Climate Change and Public Health: What Can Job Postings and an Employer Survey Tell Us?;Climate change is acknowledged to be a major risk to public health. Skills and competencies related to climate change are becoming a part of the curriculum at schools of public health and are now a competency required by schools in Europe and Australia. However, it is unclear whether graduates of public health programs focusing on climate change are in demand in the current job market. The authors analyzed current job postings, 16 years worth of job postings on a public health job board, and survey responses from prospective employers. The current job market appears small but there is evidence from job postings that it may be growing, and 91.7% of survey respondents believe the need for public health professionals with training in climate change may grow in the next 5–10 years. Current employers value skills/competencies such as the knowledge of climate mitigation/adaptation, climate-health justice, direct/indirect and downstream effects of climate on health, health impact assessment, risk assessment, pollution-health consequences and causes, Geographic Information System (GIS) mapping, communication/writing, finance/economics, policy analysis, systems thinking, and interdisciplinary understanding. Ensuring that competencies align with current and future needs is a key aspect of curriculum development. At the same time, we recognize that while we attempt to predict future workforce needs with historical data or surveys, the disruptive reality created by climate change cannot be modeled from prior trends, and we must therefore adopt new paradigms of education for the emerging future.
213;Mental health and climate change in Africa;It is now widely acknowledged that low- and middle-income countries in Africa are among global hotspots for high vulnerability to climate change, despite making comparatively low contributions to this phenomenon. Climate change has been shown to affect mental health as a result of disruption of social and economic structures that populations depend on for good health, including mental health. After decades of neglect, recent efforts by governments such as in Kenya to address the twin issues of climate change and mental health demonstrate the growing importance of these issues. Here we briefly review the evidence of climate change impacts on mental health in Africa and demonstrate that there is need for more contextual awareness and research in this area in Africa to mitigate or forestall potential mental health crises in the near future. We recommend systematic efforts to support funding for research and interventions at the nexus between climate change and mental health in Africa, and urge institutions and governments in Africa to begin paying attention to this emerging threat to the health of African populations.
214;Climate change and One Health;Abstract The journal The Lancet recently published a countdown on health and climate change. Attention was focused solely on humans. However, animals, including wildlife, livestock and pets, may also be impacted by climate change. Complementary to the high relevance of awareness rising for protecting humans against climate change, here we present a One Health approach, which aims at the simultaneous protection of humans, animals and the environment from climate change impacts (climate change adaptation). We postulate that integrated approaches save human and animal lives and reduce costs when compared to public and animal health sectors working separately. A One Health approach to climate change adaptation may significantly contribute to food security with emphasis on animal source foods, extensive livestock systems, particularly ruminant livestock, environmental sanitation, and steps towards regional and global integrated syndromic surveillance and response systems. The cost of outbreaks of emerging vector‐borne zoonotic pathogens may be much lower if they are detected early in the vector or in livestock rather than later in humans. Therefore, integrated community‐based surveillance of zoonoses is a promising avenue to reduce health effects of climate change.
215;Climate Change, Hurricanes, and Health.;An editorial is presented which addresses the authors' views about public health and climate change in relation to various natural disasters such as Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria, and it mentions several other articles which appear in the same issue of the journal and deal with topics such as the causal contributions of severe and extreme weather events to climate change and various health consequences. Storm severity, vector-borne diseases, and water-borne infections are assessed.
216;The Interplay of Climate Change and Air Pollution on Health;"Purpose of ReviewAir pollution significantly affects health, causing up to 7 million premature deaths annually with an even larger number of hospitalizations and days of sick leave. Climate change could alter the dispersion of primary pollutants, particularly particulate matter, and intensify the formation of secondary pollutants, such as near-surface ozone. The purpose of the review is to evaluate the recent evidence on the impacts of climate change on air pollution and air pollution-related health impacts and identify knowledge gaps for future research.Recent FindingsSeveral studies modelled future ozone and particulate matter concentrations and calculated the resulting health impacts under different climate scenarios. Due to climate change, ozone- and fine particle-related mortalities are expected to increase in most studies; however, results differ by region, assumed climate change scenario and other factors such as population and background emissions.SummaryThis review explores the relationships between climate change, air pollution and air pollution-related health impacts. The results highly depend on the climate change scenario used and on projections of future air pollution emissions, with relatively high uncertainty. Studies primarily focused on mortality; projections on the effects on morbidity are needed."
217;The Impact of Climate Change on Mental Health and Emotional Wellbeing: A Narrative Review of Current Evidence, and its Implications;"Abstract Converging global evidence highlights the dire consequences of climate change for human mental health and wellbeing. This paper summarises literature across relevant disciplines to provide a comprehensive narrative review of the multiple pathways through which climate change interacts with mental health and wellbeing. Climate change acts as a risk amplifier by disrupting the conditions known to support good mental health, including socioeconomic, cultural and environmental conditions, and living and working conditions. The disruptive influence of rising global temperatures and extreme weather events, such as experiencing a heatwave or water insecurity, compounds existing stressors experienced by individuals and communities. This has deleterious effects on people’s mental health and is particularly acute for those groups already disadvantaged within and across countries. Awareness and experiences of escalating climate threats and climate inaction can generate understandable psychological distress; though strong emotional responses can also motivate climate action. We highlight opportunities to support individuals and communities to cope with and act on climate change. Consideration of the multiple and interconnected pathways of climate impacts and their influence on mental health determinants must inform evidence-based interventions. Appropriate action that centres climate justice can reduce the current and future mental health burden, while simultaneously improving the conditions that nurture wellbeing and equality. The presented evidence adds further weight to the need for decisive climate action by decision makers across all scales."
218;Climate Change and Global Child Health;Climate change threatens to reverse the gains in global child health and the reductions in global child mortality made over the past 25 years. There is broad recognition that greenhouse gases emitted by human activities are causing climate change.1,2 The problem of climate change transcends geopolitical boundaries and will have extensive impacts on child health and security (Fig 1).3 With implications for all of humanity, climate change will disproportionately affect children and the poor, magnifying existing disparities in social determinates of health.4,5    FIGURE 1  Climate-related environmental health threats to children.    Changes in temperature and weather patterns are already occurring. Global surface temperatures were the highest ever recorded in 2016, and 9 of the past 10 years were the warmest on record.6 Dramatic changes to the climate are expected to occur within the life span of current pediatric patients. The 2013 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change assessed that global temperatures will likely rise 2°C and may increase 4.8°C by 2100 if current trends in emissions continue (Fig 2).2,7 In the same scenario, the average global sea level rise will accelerate, and seas will likely rise 45 to 82 cm by 2100, relative to 1986–2005 levels.2 Economic damage in the United States is predicted to be 1.2% of gross domestic product for every 1°C increase in temperature.8 Natural disasters will increase in frequency and intensity.2 These climate-related threats are widely considered the most significant global health challenge of our lifetime.9    FIGURE 2  The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change projected range of temperature increases by 2100 under high-emission and low-emission scenarios.

219;Knowledge and perception about climate change and human health: findings from a baseline survey among vulnerable communities in Bangladesh;BackgroundBangladesh is one of the countries most vulnerable to climate change (CC). A basic understanding of public perception on vulnerability, attitude and the risk in relation to CC and health will provide strategic directions for government policy, adaptation strategies and development of community-based guidelines. The objective of this study was to collect community-based data on peoples’ knowledge and perception about CC and its impact on health.MethodsIn 2012, a cross-sectional survey was undertaken among 6720 households of 224 enumeration areas of rural villages geographically distributed in seven vulnerable districts of Bangladesh, with total population of 19,228,598. Thirty households were selected randomly from each enumeration area using the household listing provided by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS). Information was collected from all the 6720 research participants using a structured questionnaire. An observation checklist was used by the interviewers to collect household- and community-related information. In addition, we selected the head of each household as the eligible participant for an interview. Evidence of association between sociodemographic variables and knowledge of CC was explored by cross-tabulation and measured using chi-square tests. Logistic regression models were used to further explore the predictors of knowledge.ResultsThe study revealed that the residents of the rural communities selected for this study largely come from a low socioeconomic background: only 9.6 % had postsecondary education or higher, the majority worked as day labourer or farmer (60 %), and only 10 % earned a monthly income above BDT 12000 (equivalent to US $150 approx.). The majority of the participants (54.2 %) had some knowledge about CC but 45.8 % did not (p < 0.001). The majority of knowledgeable participants (n = 3645) felt excessive temperature as the change of climate (83.2 %). Among all the respondents (n = 6720), 94.5 % perceived change in climate and extreme weather events. Most of them (91.9 %) observed change in rainfall patterns in the last 10 years, and 97.8 % people think their health care expenditure increased after the extreme weather events. Age, educational qualification, monthly income, and occupation were significantly associated with the knowledge about climate change (p < 0.001). People with higher educational level or who live near a school were more knowledgeable about CC and its impact on health.ConclusionsThe knowledge level about CC in our study group was average but the perception and awareness of CC related events and its impact on health was high. The most influential factor leading to understanding of CC and its impact on health was education. School-based intervention could be explored to increase peoples’ knowledge about CC and necessary health adaptation at community level.
220;Climate change and the health impact of aflatoxins exposure in Portugal – an overview;ABSTRACT Climate change has been indicated as a driver for food safety issues worldwide, mainly due to the impact on the occurrence of food safety hazards at various stages of food chain. Mycotoxins, natural contaminants produced by fungi, are among the most important of such hazards. Aflatoxins, which have the highest acute and chronic toxicity of all mycotoxins, assume particular importance. A recent study predicted aflatoxin contamination in maize and wheat crops in Europe within the next 100 years and aflatoxin B1 is predicted to become a food safety issue in Europe, especially in the most probable scenario of climate change (+2°C). This review discusses the potential influence of climate change on the health risk associated to aflatoxins dietary exposure of Portuguese population. We estimated the burden of disease associated to the current aflatoxin exposure for Portuguese population in terms of Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs). It is expected that in the future the number of DALYs and the associated cases of hepatocellular carcinoma due to aflatoxins exposure will increase due to climate change. The topics highlighted through this review, including the potential impact on health of the Portuguese population through the dietary exposure to aflatoxins, should represent an alert for the potential consequences of an incompletely explored perspective of climate change. Politics and decision-makers should be involved and committed to implement effective measures to deal with climate change issues and to reduce its possible consequences. This review constitutes a contribution for the prioritisation of strategies to face the unequal burden of effects of weather-related hazards in Portugal and across Europe.
221;Advancing the framework for considering the effects of climate change on worker safety and health;"ABSTRACT In 2009, a preliminary framework for how climate change could affect worker safety and health was described. That framework was based on a literature search from 1988–2008 that supported seven categories of climate-related occupational hazards: (1) increased ambient temperature; (2) air pollution; (3) ultraviolet radiation exposure; (4) extreme weather; (5) vector-borne diseases and expanded habitats; (6) industrial transitions and emerging industries; and (7) changes in the built environment. This article reviews the published literature from 2008–2014 in each of the seven categories. Additionally, three new topics related to occupational safety and health are considered: mental health effects, economic burden, and potential worker safety and health impacts associated with the nascent field of climate intervention (geoengineering). Beyond updating the literature, this article also identifies key priorities for action to better characterize and understand how occupational safety and health may be associated with climate change events and ensure that worker health and safety issues are anticipated, recognized, evaluated, and mitigated. These key priorities include research, surveillance, risk assessment, risk management, and policy development. Strong evidence indicates that climate change will continue to present occupational safety and health hazards, and this framework may be a useful tool for preventing adverse effects to workers."
222;Assessing Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Health Co-Benefits: A Structured Review of Lifestyle-Related Climate Change Mitigation Strategies;This is the first structured review to identify and summarize research on lifestyle choices that improve health and have the greatest potential to mitigate climate change. Two literature searches were conducted on: (1) active transport health co-benefits, and (2) dietary health co-benefits. Articles needed to quantify both greenhouse gas emissions and health or nutrition outcomes resulting from active transport or diet changes. A data extraction tool (PRISMA) was created for article selection and evaluation. A rubric was devised to assess the biases, limitations and uncertainties of included articles. For active transport 790 articles were retrieved, nine meeting the inclusion criteria. For diet 2524 articles were retrieved, 23 meeting the inclusion criteria. A total of 31 articles were reviewed and assessed using the rubric, as one article met the inclusion criteria for both active transport and diet co-benefits. Methods used to estimate the effect of diet or active transport modification vary greatly precluding meta-analysis. The scale of impact on health and greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) outcomes depends predominately on the aggressiveness of the diet or active transport scenario modelled, versus the modelling technique. Effective mitigation policies, infrastructure that supports active transport and low GHGE food delivery, plus community engagement are integral in achieving optimal health and GHGE outcomes. Variation in culture, nutritional and health status, plus geographic density will determine which mitigation scenario(s) best suit individual communities.
223;Climate Change and Mental Health: Implications for Nurses.;Climate change has received public health attention over the past 3 decades. It is well established that climate change is associated with myriad health issues, but less has been mentioned in public health discourse about the impacts of climate change on population mental health. The purpose of the current article is to provide an overview of the impacts of climate change on mental health, and to discuss opportunities for mental health nurses to reduce health problems related to climate change. Acute events and chronic consequences of climate change can impact mental health outcomes and contribute to depressive disorders, anxiety, and trauma-related disorders. The nursing profession must be prepared to address climate change to promote best health outcomes for individuals around the globe. It is critical that mental health nurses act as leaders in understanding and addressing climate change to improve the mental health of populations.

224;Climate Change and Cascading Risks from Infectious Disease;"Climate change is adversely affecting the burden of infectious disease throughout the world, which is a health security threat. Climate-sensitive infectious disease includes vector-borne diseases such as malaria, whose transmission potential is expected to increase because of enhanced climatic suitability for the mosquito vector in Asia, sub-Saharan Africa, and South America. Climatic suitability for the mosquitoes that can carry dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is also likely to increase, facilitating further increases in the geographic range and longer transmission seasons, and raising concern for expansion of these diseases into temperate zones, particularly under higher greenhouse gas emission scenarios. Early spring temperatures in 2018 seem to have contributed to the early onset and extensive West Nile virus outbreak in Europe, a pathogen expected to expand further beyond its current distribution, due to a warming climate. As for tick-borne diseases, climate change is projected to continue to contribute to the spread of Lyme disease and tick-borne encephalitis, particularly in North America and Europe. Schistosomiasis is a water-borne disease and public health concern in Africa, Latin America, the Middle East, and Southeast Asia; climate change is anticipated to change its distribution, with both expansions and contractions expected. Other water-borne diseases that cause diarrheal diseases have declined significantly over the last decades owing to socioeconomic development and public health measures but changes in climate can reverse some of these positive developments. Weather and climate events, population movement, land use changes, urbanization, global trade, and other drivers can catalyze a succession of secondary events that can lead to a range of health impacts, including infectious disease outbreaks. These cascading risk pathways of causally connected events can result in large-scale outbreaks and affect society at large. We review climatic and other cascading drivers of infectious disease with projections under different climate change scenarios. 5E6fdnCC7GZ6vtJap2g1wp Supplementary file1 (MP4 328467 KB) Supplementary file1 (MP4 328467 KB)"
225;The Implications of Climate Change for Children in Lower-Income Countries;Abstract:This article provides a brief overview of the implications for children of climate change—both of extreme weather events and more gradual changes, along with the adaptations likely to be made at various levels. Because data on the impacts of climate change tend not to be disaggregated by sub-population or by age, there is insufficient knowledge to present a comprehensive picture of the impacts for this age group. Instead, this paper extrapolates from existing knowledge in a number of related areas to present a picture of the probable implications for children's health, safety, and long-term well being, especially in lower-income countries and communities that are at highest risk from climate change. The article stresses not only children's vulnerability, but also their resilience and their capacity as active agents to play a role in addressing the challenges they confront related to climate change.
226;Social and health dimensions of climate change in the Amazon;Abstract Context: The Amazon region has been part of climate change debates for decades, yet attention to its social and health dimensions has been limited. Objective: This paper assesses literature on the social and health dimensions of climate change in the Amazon. A conceptual framework underscores multiple stresses and exposures created by interactions between climate change and local social-environmental conditions. Methods: Using the Thomson-Reuter Web of Science, this study bibliometrically assessed the overall literature on climate change in the Amazon, including Physical Sciences, Social Sciences, Anthropology, Environmental Science/Ecology and Public, Environmental/Occupational Health. From this assessment, a relevant sub-sample was selected and complemented with literature from the Brazilian database SciELO. Results: This sample discusses three dimensions of climate change impacts in the region: livelihood changes, vector-borne diseases and microbial proliferation, and respiratory diseases. This analysis elucidates imbalance and disconnect between ecological, physical and social and health dimensions of climate change and between continental and regional climate analysis, and sub-regional and local levels. Conclusion: Work on the social and health implications of climate change in the Amazon falls significantly behind other research areas, limiting reliable information for analytical models and for Amazonian policy-makers and society at large. Collaborative research is called for.
227;Climate change and vector-borne diseases of public health significance;There has been much debate as to whether or not climate change will have, or has had, any significant effect on risk from vector-borne diseases. The debate on the former has focused on the degree to which occurrence and levels of risk of vector-borne diseases are determined by climate-dependent or independent factors, while the debate on the latter has focused on whether changes in disease incidence are due to climate at all, and/or are attributable to recent climate change. Here I review possible effects of climate change on vector-borne diseases, methods used to predict these effects and the evidence to date of changes in vector-borne disease risks that can be attributed to recent climate change. Predictions have both over- and underestimated the effects of climate change. Mostly under-estimations of effects are due to a focus only on direct effects of climate on disease ecology while more distal effects on society's capacity to control and prevent vector-borne disease are ignored. There is increasing evidence for possible impacts of recent climate change on some vector-borne diseases but for the most part, observed data series are too short (or non-existent), and impacts of climate-independent factors too great, to confidently attribute changing risk to climate change.
228;Prevalence and determinants of mental health related to climate change in Australia;"Aims: The climate emergency will likely prove this century’s greatest threat to public health within which mental health effects need consideration. While studies consistently show the majority of Australians are very concerned about the impacts of climate change, there is limited evidence from nation-wide research linking climate change with mental health burden in sub-populations. This study aimed to understand the impact of climate change on mental health in the Australian population and identify populations who are most at risk of climate-related mental health burden. Methods: A nation-wide Australian survey conducted between August and November 2020 of adults was approximately representative across sex, age, location, state and area disadvantage. Two-stage recruitment involved unrestricted self-selected community sample through mainstream and social media (N = 4428) and purposeful sampling using an online panel (N = 1055). Results: Most Australians report having a direct experience of a climate change–related event. Young people are experiencing significant rates of eco-anxiety. One in four people with direct experience of a climate change–related event met post-traumatic stress disorder screening criteria. People who have not had a direct experience are showing symptoms of pre-trauma, particularly in younger age groups and women. There were 9.37% (503/5370) of respondents with responses indicating significant eco-anxiety, 15.68% (370/2359) with pre-traumatic stress and 25.60% (727/2840) with post-traumatic stress disorder. Multivariable regressions confirmed that younger people are more affected by eco-anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder (pre- or post-trauma); women are more affected by post-traumatic stress disorder (pre- or post-trauma) and those from more disadvantaged regions are more affected by eco-anxiety. Conclusion: Australia is facing a potential mental health crisis. Individuals with and without direct experience of climate change are reporting significant mental health impacts, with younger age groups being disproportionately affected. There are key roles for clinicians and other health professionals in responding to and preventing climate-related mental health burden."
229;Climate Change and Mental Health.;": Climate change is an enormous challenge for our communities, our country, and our world. Recently much attention has been paid to the physical impacts of climate change, including extreme heat events, droughts, extreme storms, and rising sea levels. However, much less attention has been paid to the psychological impacts. This article examines the likely psychological impacts of climate change, including anxiety, stress, and depression; increases in violence and aggression; and loss of community identity. Nurses can play a vital role in local and regional climate strategies by preparing their patients, health care facilities, and communities to effectively address the anticipated mental health impacts of climate change."
230;Climate Change and Zoonoses: A Review of Concepts, Definitions, and Bibliometrics;"Climate change can have a complex impact that also influences human and animal health. For example, climate change alters the conditions for pathogens and vectors of zoonotic diseases. Signs of this are the increasing spread of the West Nile and Usutu viruses and the establishment of new vector species, such as specific mosquito and tick species, in Europe and other parts of the world. With these changes come new challenges for maintaining human and animal health. This paper reports on an analysis of the literature focused on a bibliometric analysis of the Scopus database and VOSviewer software for creating visualization maps which identifies the zoonotic health risks for humans and animals caused by climate change. The sources retained for the analysis totaled 428 and different thresholds (N) were established for each item varying from N 5 to 10. The main findings are as follows: First, published documents increased in 2009–2015 peaking in 2020. Second, the primary sources have changed since 2018, partly attributable to the increase in human health concerns due to human-to-human transmission. Third, the USA, the UK, Canada, Australia, Italy, and Germany perform most zoonosis research. For instance, sixty documents and only 17 countries analyzed for co-authorship analysis met the threshold led by the USA; the top four author keywords were “climate change”, “zoonosis”, “epidemiology”, and “one health;” the USA, the UK, Germany, and Spain led the link strength (inter-collaboration); the author keywords showed that 37 out of the 1023 keywords met the threshold, and the authors’ keyword’s largest node of the bibliometric map contains the following: infectious diseases, emerging diseases, disease ecology, one health, surveillance, transmission, and wildlife. Finally, zoonotic diseases, which were documented in the literature in the past, have evolved, especially during the years 2010–2015, as evidenced by the sharp augmentation of publications addressing ad-hoc events and peaking in 2020 with the COVID-19 outbreak."
231;Talking about Climate Change and Environmental Degradation with Patients in Primary Care: A Cross-Sectional Survey on Knowledge, Potential Domains of Action and Points of View of General Practitioners;Purpose: General practitioners (GPs) could play a role in mitigating climate change by raising awareness of its impact on human health and implementing changes to improve population health and decreasing environmental footprints. The aim of this study was to assess GPs’ knowledge and perspectives about the health impacts of climate change. Method: A questionnaire was sent to 1972 GPs in the French-speaking part of Switzerland. Knowledge of the impact of environmental degradations and climate change on health and willingness to address climate change with patients, to be exemplary and to act as role models were surveyed as well as demographic characteristics of GPs. Results: Respondents (N = 497) expressed a high level of self-reported knowledge regarding climate change, although it was lower for more specific topics, such as planetary health or health–environment co-benefits. Participants mostly agreed that it is necessary to adapt clinical practice to the health impacts of climate change and that they have a role in providing information on climate change and its links to human health. Conclusion: Most of the GPs were concerned about environmental and climate degradation. However, this study revealed a gap between the willingness of GPs to integrate the impact of climate change on health into their clinical activities and their lack of overall knowledge and scientific evidence on effective interventions. A promising way forward may be to develop co-benefit interventions adapted to the clinical setting on diet, active mobility and connecting with nature.
232;Climate Change and Public Health;It is clear that the public health community is concerned about the human health impacts of climate change, but are we inadvertently underestimating the scope of the problem and obfuscating potentially useful interventions by using a narrow intellectual frame in our discussions with policy makers? If we take a more holistic approach, we see that the public health impacts of climate change are only one subset of the enormous public health impacts of fossil fuel burning. This broader perspective can provide a more accurate and comprehensive assessment that is more useful for decision making in public policy settings.
233;An investigation into the relationship between climate change anxiety and mental health among Gen Z Filipinos;"Climate change and mental health concerns are both defining issues of the generation of today. It has been established that the worsening climate causes many environmental disasters and physical health problems. However, its psychological impacts are still not well understood. Climate change has brought about an emerging psychological phenomenon termed ‘climate anxiety’ or ‘eco-anxiety,’ which has been described as a ""chronic fear of environmental doom"" (Clayton et al., 2017 , p. 68) due to the impact of climate change. This predictive cross-sectional study investigated the link between climate change anxiety and mental health among 433 Filipinos. A total of 145 males and 288 females aged 18 to 26 completed the Climate Change Anxiety Scale and the Mental Health Inventory (MHI-38). Results show a significant relationship between climate change anxiety and mental health, with climate change anxiety predicting 13.5% of the overall Mental Health Index variance. Significantly, climate change anxiety was associated with the MHI-38’s global scale of Psychological Distress but not with the global scale of Psychological Well-being. The findings are discussed concerning the broader context of research on the mental health impacts of climate change."
234;Aboriginal Population and Climate Change in Australia: Implications for Health and Adaptation Planning;The health impacts of climate are widely recognised, and extensive modelling is available on predicted changes to climate globally. The impact of these changes may affect populations differently depending on a range of factors, including geography, socioeconomics and culture. This study reviewed current evidence on the health risks of climate change for Australian Aboriginal populations and linked Aboriginal demographic data to historical and projected climate data to describe the distribution of climate-related exposures in Aboriginal compared to non-Aboriginal populations in New South Wales (NSW), Australia. The study showed Aboriginal populations were disproportionately exposed to a range of climate extremes in heat, rainfall and drought, and this disproportionate exposure was predicted to increase with climate change over the coming decades. Aboriginal people currently experience higher rates of climate-sensitive health conditions and socioeconomic disadvantages, which will impact their capacity to adapt to climate change. Climate change may also adversely affect cultural practices. These factors will likely impact the health and well-being of Aboriginal people in NSW and inhibit measures to close the gap in health between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal populations. Climate change, health and equity need to be key considerations in all policies at all levels of government. Effective Aboriginal community engagement is urgently needed to develop and implement climate adaptation responses to improve health and social service preparedness and secure environmental health infrastructure such as drinking water supplies and suitably managed social housing. Further Aboriginal-led research is required to identify the cultural impacts of climate change on health, including adaptive responses based on Aboriginal knowledges.
235;Climate Change and Public Health Surveillance: Toward a Comprehensive Strategy;Context: Climate change poses a host of serious threats to human health that robust public health surveillance systems can help address. It is unknown, however, whether existing surveillance systems in the United States have adequate capacity to serve that role, nor what actions may be needed to develop adequate capacity. Objective: Our goals were to review efforts to assess and strengthen the capacity of public health surveillance systems to support health-related adaptation to climate change in the United States and to determine whether additional efforts are warranted. Methods: Building on frameworks issued by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, we specified 4 core components of public health surveillance capacity relevant to climate change health threats. Using standard methods, we next identified and analyzed multiple assessments of the existing, relevant capacity of public health surveillance systems as well as attempts to improve that capacity. We also received information from selected national public health associations. Findings: Multiple federal, state, and local public health agencies, professional associations, and researchers have made valuable, initial efforts to assess and strengthen surveillance capacity. These efforts, however, have been made by entities working independently and without the benefit of a shared conceptual framework or strategy. Their principal focus has been on identifying suitable indicators and data sources largely to the exclusion of other core components of surveillance capacity. Conclusions: A more comprehensive and strategic approach is needed to build the public health surveillance capacity required to protect the health of Americans in a world of rapidly evolving climate change. Public health practitioners and policy makers at all levels can use the findings and issues reviewed in this article as they lead design and execution of a coordinated, multisector strategic plan to create and sustain that capacity.
236;Challenges and Opportunities for Advancing Work on Climate Change and Public Health;"Climate change poses a major threat to public health. Strategies that address climate change have considerable potential to benefit health and decrease health inequities, yet public health engagement at the intersection of public health, equity, and climate change has been limited. This research seeks to understand the barriers to and opportunities for advancing work at this nexus. We conducted semi-structured in-depth interviews (N = 113) with public health and climate change professionals and thematic analysis. Barriers to public health engagement in addressing climate change include individual perceptions that climate change is not urgent or solvable and insufficient understanding of climate change’s health impacts and programmatic connections. Institutional barriers include a lack of public health capacity, authority, and leadership; a narrow framework for public health practice that limits work on the root causes of climate change and health; and compartmentalization within and across sectors. Opportunities include integrating climate change into current public health practice; providing inter-sectoral support for climate solutions with health co-benefits; and using a health frame to engage and mobilize communities. Efforts to increase public health sector engagement should focus on education and communications, building leadership and funding, and increasing work on the shared root causes of climate change and health inequities."
237;Nurses' Perspectives on Climate Change, Health, and Nursing Practice.;AIM The purpose of this study was to explore Canadian nurses' perspectives on climate change, health, nursing practice, and the relationships between these concepts.   BACKGROUND Climate change negatively impacts human health. With a mandate to promote health, nurses have a professional and ethical responsibility to address climate change. Little is known about Canadian nurses' perspectives on climate change or how they perceive of their professional responsibility towards addressing it.   METHODS A focused ethnography was conducted in three medicine units and the emergency room at a Canadian hospital. Nurses (n=22) participated in semi-structured interviews and observations were collected. Data were analysed via thematic analysis. Reporting is in accordance with the COREQ guideline.   RESULTS Three themes were identified: muddled terminology, climate change and health, and nursing's relationship to climate change.   CONCLUSION Participants had varying levels of knowledge about climate change and its relationship to health or practice. Climate change was a personal concern and nursing's role in addressing it was not understood.   RELEVANCE TO PRACTICE This study highlighted that practicing nurses did not readily recognize their role in addressing climate change. More work is needed to clarify this role and bring it into the consciousness of every-day nursing practice. Furthermore, more work is needed to examine how healthcare organizations can better support environmentally responsible nursing practice.
238;Climate change, health, and conflict in Africa’s arc of instability;"IntroductIon Climate change lies at the heart of many complex humanitarian emergencies and emerging global health challenges, with Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) identified as one of the most vulnerable regions to the impacts of climate change.1 An arc stretching from Somalia and eritrea in the east to Mauritania in the west forms a band of countries that are particularly vulnerable to the consequences of climate change (Figure 1).2 This arc experiences a devastating combination of state fragmentation, islamist insurgency, and climate change, undermining livelihood strategies across the region. A climate injustice exists; despite contributing relatively little to the anthropogenic causes of climate change, individuals living in these countries face the most severe impacts.3"
239;Antibiotic-Resistant Bacteria in Aquaculture and Climate Change: A Challenge for Health in the Mediterranean Area;Aquaculture is the productive activity that will play a crucial role in the challenges of the millennium, such as the need for proteins that support humans and the respect for the environment. Aquaculture is an important economic activity in the Mediterranean basin. A great impact is presented, however, by aquaculture practices as they involve the use of antibiotics for treatment and prophylaxis. As a consequence of the use of antibiotics in aquaculture, antibiotic resistance is induced in the surrounding bacteria in the column water, sediment, and fish-associated bacterial strains. Through horizontal gene transfer, bacteria can diffuse antibiotic-resistance genes and mobile resistance genes further spreading genetic determinants. Once triggered, antibiotic resistance easily spreads among aquatic microbial communities and, from there, can reach human pathogenic bacteria, making vain the use of antibiotics for human health. Climate change claims a significant role in this context, as rising temperatures can affect cell physiology in bacteria in the same way as antibiotics, causing antibiotic resistance to begin with. The Mediterranean Sea represents a ‘hot spot’ in terms of climate change and aspects of antibiotic resistance in aquaculture in this area can be significantly amplified, thus increasing threats to human health. Practices must be adopted to counteract negative impacts on human health, with a reduction in the use of antibiotics as a pivotal point. In the meantime, it is necessary to act against climate change by reducing anthropogenic impacts, for example by reducing CO2 emissions into the atmosphere. The One Health type approach, which involves the intervention of different skills, such as veterinary, ecology, and medicine in compliance with the principles of sustainability, is necessary and strongly recommended to face these important challenges for human and animal health, and for environmental safety in the Mediterranean area.
240;Maternal and newborn health risks of climate change: A call for awareness and global action;Climate change represents one of the largest global health threats of the 21st century with immediate and long‐term consequences for the most vulnerable populations, especially in the poorest countries with the least capacity to adapt to climate change. Pregnant women and newborns are increasingly being recognized as vulnerable populations in the context of climate change. The effects can be direct or indirect through heat stress, extreme weather events and air pollution, potentially impacting both the immediate and long‐term health of pregnant women and newborns through a broad range of mechanisms. In 2008, the World Health Organization passed a resolution during the 61st World Health Assembly, recognizing the need for research to identify strategies and health‐system strengthening to mitigate the effects of climate change on health. Climate adaptation plans need to consider vulnerable populations such as pregnant women and neonates and a broad multisectoral approach to improve overall resilience of societies.
241;Negative emotions about climate change are related to insomnia symptoms and mental health: Cross-sectional evidence from 25 countries;Climate change threatens mental health via increasing exposure to the social and economic disruptions created by extreme weather and large-scale climatic events, as well as through the anxiety associated with recognising the existential threat posed by the climate crisis. Considering the growing levels of climate change awareness across the world, negative emotions like anxiety and worry about climate-related risks are a potentially pervasive conduit for the adverse impacts of climate change on mental health. In this study, we examined how negative climate-related emotions relate to sleep and mental health among a diverse non-representative sample of individuals recruited from 25 countries, as well as a Norwegian nationally-representative sample. Overall, we found that negative climate-related emotions are positively associated with insomnia symptoms and negatively related to self-rated mental health in most countries. Our findings suggest that climate-related psychological stressors are significantly linked with mental health in many countries and draw attention to the need for cross-disciplinary research aimed at achieving rigorous empirical assessments of the unique challenge posed to mental health by negative emotional responses to climate change.
242;Role of Health Professionals Regarding the Impact of Climate Change on Health—An Exploratory Review;Health professionals are increasingly urged to act to protect individuals and populations against the negative effects of climate and environment change on health. However, the amount of evidence supporting initiatives to that end is unknown. We explored the literature examining the awareness, preparedness, and role of healthcare professionals to inform about the impact of climate change on health on the one hand, and literature about the effectiveness of interventions mediated by health professionals aiming at reducing the environmental impact of human activities on the other hand. We included 137 articles published between 2000 and 2020, mostly in general medical and nursing journals. The typical article was a perspective, commentary, or other special article aimed at alerting readers about the impact of climate and environment change on health. We identified 22 studies, of which only two reported interventions. Despite increasing efforts of health professionals to address climate and environment change and related health risks, health literature supporting such efforts remains scarce, and studies assessing the effectiveness of interventions are lacking. We need appropriate evidence to indicate which interventions should be prioritized, considering that the association of health issues with climate and environment change could constitute an effective lever for change.

244;Climate change and vector-borne diseases: what are the implications for public health research and policy?;"Vector-borne diseases continue to contribute significantly to the global burden of disease, and cause epidemics that disrupt health security and cause wider socioeconomic impacts around the world. All are sensitive in different ways to weather and climate conditions, so that the ongoing trends of increasing temperature and more variable weather threaten to undermine recent global progress against these diseases. Here, we review the current state of the global public health effort to address this challenge, and outline related initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) and its partners. Much of the debate to date has centred on attribution of past changes in disease rates to climate change, and the use of scenario-based models to project future changes in risk for specific diseases. While these can give useful indications, the unavoidable uncertainty in such analyses, and contingency on other socioeconomic and public health determinants in the past or future, limit their utility as decision-support tools. For operational health agencies, the most pressing need is the strengthening of current disease control efforts to bring down current disease rates and manage short-term climate risks, which will, in turn, increase resilience to long-term climate change. The WHO and partner agencies are working through a range of programmes to (i) ensure political support and financial investment in preventive and curative interventions to bring down current disease burdens; (ii) promote a comprehensive approach to climate risk management; (iii) support applied research, through definition of global and regional research agendas, and targeted research initiatives on priority diseases and population groups."
245;U.S. Air Quality and Health Benefits from Avoided Climate Change under Greenhouse Gas Mitigation.;We evaluate the impact of climate change on U.S. air quality and health in 2050 and 2100 using a global modeling framework and integrated economic, climate, and air pollution projections. Three internally consistent socioeconomic scenarios are used to value health benefits of greenhouse gas mitigation policies specifically derived from slowing climate change. Our projections suggest that climate change, exclusive of changes in air pollutant emissions, can significantly impact ozone (O3) and fine particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution across the U.S. and increase associated health effects. Climate policy can substantially reduce these impacts, and climate-related air pollution health benefits alone can offset a significant fraction of mitigation costs. We find that in contrast to cobenefits from reductions to coemitted pollutants, the climate-induced air quality benefits of policy increase with time and are largest between 2050 and 2100. Our projections also suggest that increasing climate policy stringency beyond a certain degree may lead to diminishing returns relative to its cost. However, our results indicate that the air quality impacts of climate change are substantial and should be considered by cost-benefit climate policy analyses.
246;Simultaneously Mitigating Near-Term Climate Change and Improving Human Health and Food Security;Why Wait? Tropospheric ozone can be dangerous to human health, can be harmful to vegetation, and is a major contributor to climate warming. Black carbon also has significant negative effects on health and air quality and causes warming of the atmosphere. Shindell et al. (p. 183) present results of an analysis of emissions, atmospheric processes, and impacts for each of these pollutants. Seven measures were identified that, if rapidly implemented, would significantly reduce global warming over the next 50 years, with the potential to prevent millions of deaths worldwide from outdoor air pollution. Furthermore, some crop yields could be improved by decreasing agricultural damage. Most of the measures thus appear to have economic benefits well above the cost of their implementation. Reducing anthropogenic emissions of methane and black carbon would have multiple climate and health benefits. Tropospheric ozone and black carbon (BC) contribute to both degraded air quality and global warming. We considered ~400 emission control measures to reduce these pollutants by using current technology and experience. We identified 14 measures targeting methane and BC emissions that reduce projected global mean warming ~0.5°C by 2050. This strategy avoids 0.7 to 4.7 million annual premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and increases annual crop yields by 30 to 135 million metric tons due to ozone reductions in 2030 and beyond. Benefits of methane emissions reductions are valued at $700 to $5000 per metric ton, which is well above typical marginal abatement costs (less than $250). The selected controls target different sources and influence climate on shorter time scales than those of carbon dioxide–reduction measures. Implementing both substantially reduces the risks of crossing the 2°C threshold.
247;Migration health crisis associated with climate change: A systematic review;BACKGROUND: The empirical assessment of the health outcomes associated with migration caused by climate change is still unclear. However, health outcomes in the early stages are expected to be similar to the health outcomes associated with refugees. The objective of the present study was a systematic review of the health effects of migration caused by climate change. METHODOLOGY: A systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Online databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google Scholar) were used to identify papers published that evaluated the health effects of migration caused by climate change. The search, article selection, and data extraction were carried out by two researchers independently. All English-language articles on the health effects of migration caused by climate change were included in this study. RESULTS: An analysis of the complex ways in which climate change influences populations can be facilitated using a three-class classification: compulsory displacement, resettlement planning, and migration. Subsequent to climate changes, other changes, and environmental deficiencies, compulsory displacement may occur in case of inadequacy of compatibility responses. A part of migration-related health outcomes caused by climate change is from displacement from rural to urban areas, especially in developing countries. There is significant documentation on health and livelihood inequalities between migrant groups and host populations in developed countries. CONCLUSION: If climate change continues in its current direction, it is likely that the number of refugees and crises will increase in the coming decades. Although the domain and the extent of health hazards caused by the displacement of the population associated with climate change cannot be clearly predicted, by reducing global greenhouse gas emissions, along with social and environmental adaptation strategies, migration caused by climate change, health risks and its relevant crises can be greatly reduced.
248;Climate change, women’s health, and the role of obstetricians and gynecologists in leadership;Climate change is one of the major global health threats to the world's population. It is brought on by global warming due in large part to increasing levels of greenhouse gases resulting from human activity, including burning fossil fuels (carbon dioxide), animal husbandry (methane from manure), industry emissions (ozone, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide), vehicle/factory exhaust, and chlorofluorocarbon aerosols that trap extra heat in the earth's atmosphere. Resulting extremes of weather give rise to wildfires, air pollution, changes in ecology, and floods. These in turn result in displacement of populations, family disruption, violence, and major impacts on water quality and availability, food security, public health and economic infrastructures, and limited abilities for civil society to maintain citizen safety. Climate change also has direct impacts on human health and well‐being. Particularly vulnerable populations are affected, including women, pregnant women, children, the disabled, and the elderly, who comprise the majority of the poor globally. Additionally, the effects of climate change disproportionally affect disadvantaged communities, including low income and communities of color, and lower‐income countries that are at highest risk of adverse impacts when disasters occur due to inequitable distribution of resources and their socioeconomic status. The climate crisis is tilting the risk balance unfavorably for women's sexual and reproductive health and rights as well as newborn and child health. Obstetrician/gynecologists have the unique opportunity to raise awareness, educate, and advocate for mitigation strategies to reverse climate change affecting our patients and their families. This article puts climate change in the context of women's reproductive health as a public health issue, a social justice issue, a human rights issue, an economic issue, a political issue, and a gender issue that needs our attention now for the health and well‐being of this and future generations. FIGO joins a broad coalition of international researchers and the medical community in stating that the current climate crisis presents an imminent health risk to pregnant people, developing fetuses, and reproductive health, and recognizing that we need society‐wide solutions, government policies, and global cooperation to address and reduce contributors, including fossil fuel production, to climate change.
249;The effects on public health of climate change adaptation responses: a systematic review of evidence from low- and middle-income countries;Climate change adaptation responses are being developed and delivered in many parts of the world in the absence of detailed knowledge of their effects on public health. Here we present the results of a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature reporting the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). The review used the ‘Global Adaptation Mapping Initiative’ database (comprising 1682 publications related to climate change adaptation responses) that was constructed through systematic literature searches in Scopus, Web of Science and Google Scholar (2013–2020). For this study, further screening was performed to identify studies from LMICs reporting the effects on human health of climate change adaptation responses. Studies were categorised by study design and data were extracted on geographic region, population under investigation, type of adaptation response and reported health effects. The review identified 99 studies (1117 reported outcomes), reporting evidence from 66 LMICs. Only two studies were ex ante formal evaluations of climate change adaptation responses. Papers reported adaptation responses related to flooding, rainfall, drought and extreme heat, predominantly through behaviour change, and infrastructural and technological improvements. Reported (direct and intermediate) health outcomes included reduction in infectious disease incidence, improved access to water/sanitation and improved food security. All-cause mortality was rarely reported, and no papers were identified reporting on maternal and child health. Reported maladaptations were predominantly related to widening of inequalities and unforeseen co-harms. Reporting and publication-bias seems likely with only 3.5% of all 1117 health outcomes reported to be negative. Our review identified some evidence that climate change adaptation responses may have benefits for human health but the overall paucity of evidence is concerning and represents a major missed opportunity for learning. There is an urgent need for greater focus on the funding, design, evaluation and standardised reporting of the effects on health of climate change adaptation responses to enable evidence-based policy action.
250;Climate change‐triggered land degradation and planetary health: A review;Land is a vital natural resource for human socio‐ecological wellbeing. Around the world, land is being degraded due to various natural and anthropogenic factors such as flooding, wind erosion, agriculture and human settlement, and anthropogenic climate change. While significant research has been conducted on the separate dyads of: (1) anthropogenic climate change and land degradation and (2) land degradation and health, limited consideration has been given to the cause‐and‐effect relationships between anthropogenic climate change‐triggered land degradation and planetary health consequences. Using a systematic literature review and the driving force, pressure, state, exposure, effect (DPSEE) framework, this study synthesizes the complex causal relationships of anthropogenic climate change‐triggered land degradation and its planetary health consequences. Our findings demonstrate that anthropogenic climate change has induced and accelerated natural and anthropogenic land degradation through an array of pathways, resulting in planetary health consequences that can be grouped into six categories: (1) food and nutritional insecurity, (2) communicable and noncommunicable diseases, (3) livelihood insecurity, (4) physical and mental health, (5) health hazards related to extreme weather events, and (6) migration and conflict. Interlinkages exist between these six planetary health impact categories, adding to the complexity of the causal pathways. These collective impacts are hampering the realization of the UN Sustainable Development Goals around the world. The findings of this study and our DPSEE framework can help policymakers identify and integrate actions to better manage the planetary health impacts of climate change‐induced land degradation.
251;A review of mental health and wellbeing under climate change in small island developing states (SIDS);Small island developing states (SIDS) are often at the forefront of climate change impacts, including those related to health, but information on mental health and wellbeing is typically underreported. To help address this research lacuna, this paper reviews research about mental health and wellbeing under climate change in SIDS. Due to major differences in the literature’s methodologies, results, and analyses, the method is an overview and qualitative evidence synthesis of peer-reviewed publications. The findings show that mental health and wellbeing in the context of climate change have yet to feature prominently and systematically in research covering SIDS. It seems likely that major adverse mental health and wellbeing impacts linked to climate change impacts will affect SIDS peoples. Similar outcomes might also emerge when discussing climate change related situations, scenarios, and responses, irrespective of what has actually happened thus far due to climate change. In the context of inadequate health systems and stigmatisation of mental health diagnoses and treatments, as tends to occur globally, climate change narratives might present an opening for conversations about addressing mental health and wellbeing issues for SIDS.
252;Report of the intergovernmental panel on climate change: implications for the mental health policy of children and adolescents in Europe—a scoping review;"Climate change is a worldwide challenge. Its consequences do encompass severe threats not only for the existence and somatic health, but also for the mental health of children and adolescents. Mental health can be impaired by three types of consequences. Direct consequences of climate change, such as natural disasters and indirect consequences, such as loss of land, flight and migration, exposure to violence, change of social, ecological, economic or cultural environment. Moreover, the increasing awareness of the existential dimension of climate change in children and adolescents can influence their well-being or challenge their mental health. Consequences of climate change for somatic health may interact with mental health or have psychological sequelae in children and adolescents. Based on the estimates by the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, we have summarized current data on these differential pathways as to how climate change affects the mental health of children worldwide through selective literature research on Pubmed. Mental health sequelae of direct and indirect consequences of climate change, increased awareness and physical health problems caused by climate change are presented. We give insights into special vulnerabilities of children and adolescents and identify high-risk groups. As the “Fridays for Future” movement has been initiated in northern Europe, we will discuss these results with a focus on children and adolescents in Europe. The results indicate that climate change is a serious threat to children and adolescent mental health. Children´s rights, mental health and climate change should not continue to be seen as separate points; instead, they need to be brought together to address this major challenge determining the future of our children and their descendants."
253;Positive Externalities of Climate Change Mitigation and Adaptation for Human Health: A Review and Conceptual Framework for Public Health Research;Anthropogenic climate change is adversely impacting people and contributing to suffering and increased costs from climate-related diseases and injuries. In responding to this urgent and growing public health crisis, mitigation strategies are in place to reduce future greenhouse gas emissions (GHGE) while adaptation strategies exist to reduce and/or alleviate the adverse effects of climate change by increasing systems’ resilience to future impacts. While these strategies have numerous positive benefits on climate change itself, they also often have other positive externalities or health co-benefits. This knowledge can be harnessed to promote and improve global public health, particularly for the most vulnerable populations. Previous conceptual models in mitigation and adaptation studies such as the shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs) considered health in the thinking, but health outcomes were not their primary intention. Additionally, existing guidance documents such as the World Health Organization (WHO) Guidance for Climate Resilient and Environmentally Sustainable Health Care Facilities is designed primarily for public health professionals or healthcare managers in hospital settings with a primary focus on resilience. However, a detailed cross sectoral and multidisciplinary conceptual framework, which links mitigation and adaptation strategies with health outcomes as a primary end point, has not yet been developed to guide research in this area. In this paper, we briefly summarize the burden of climate change on global public health, describe important mitigation and adaptation strategies, and present key health benefits by giving context specific examples from high, middle, and low-income settings. We then provide a conceptual framework to inform future global public health research and preparedness across sectors and disciplines and outline key stakeholders recommendations in promoting climate resilient systems and advancing health equity.
254;Plant-Based Meats, Human Health, and Climate Change;There is wide scale concern about the effects of red meat on human health and climate change. Plant-based meat alternatives, designed to mimic the sensory experience and nutritional value of red meat, have recently been introduced into consumer markets. Plant-based meats are marketed under the premise of environmental and human health benefits and are aimed appeal to a broad consumer base. Meat production is critiqued for its overuse of water supplies, landscape degradation, and greenhouse gas emission, and depending on production practices, environmental footprints may be lower with plant-based meat alternatives. Life-cycle analyses suggest that the novel plant-based meat alternatives have an environmental footprint that may be lower than beef finished in feedlots, but higher than beef raised on well-managed pastures. In this review, we discuss the nutritional and ecological impacts of eating plant-based meat alternatives vs. animal meats. Most humans fall on a spectrum of omnivory: they satisfy some nutrient requirements better from plant foods, while needs for other nutrients are met more readily from animal foods. Animal foods also facilitate the uptake of several plant-derived nutrients (zinc and iron), while plant nutrients can offer protection against potentially harmful compounds in cooked meat. Thus, plant and animal foods operate in symbiotic ways to improve human health. The mimicking of animal foods using isolated plant proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals likely underestimates the true nutritional complexity of whole foods in their natural state, which contain hundreds to thousands of nutrients that impact human health. Novel plant-based meat alternatives should arguably be treated as meat alternatives in terms of sensory experience, but not as true meat replacements in terms of nutrition. If consumers wish to replace some of their meat with plant-based alternatives in the diet (a “flexitarian approach”) this is unlikely to negatively impact their overall nutrient status, but this also depends on what other foods are in their diet and the life stage of the individual.
255;Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions;The rapid anthropogenic climate change that is being experienced in the early twenty-first century is intimately entwined with the health and functioning of the biosphere. Climate change is impacting ecosystems through changes in mean conditions and in climate variability, coupled with other associated changes such as increased ocean acidification and atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations. It also interacts with other pressures on ecosystems, including degradation, defaunation and fragmentation. There is a need to understand the ecological dynamics of these climate impacts, to identify hotspots of vulnerability and resilience and to identify management interventions that may assist biosphere resilience to climate change. At the same time, ecosystems can also assist in the mitigation of, and adaptation to, climate change. The mechanisms, potential and limits of such nature-based solutions to climate change need to be explored and quantified. This paper introduces a thematic issue dedicated to the interaction between climate change and the biosphere. It explores novel perspectives on how ecosystems respond to climate change, how ecosystem resilience can be enhanced and how ecosystems can assist in addressing the challenge of a changing climate. It draws on a Royal Society-National Academy of Sciences Forum held in Washington DC in November 2018, where these themes and issues were discussed. We conclude by identifying some priorities for academic research and practical implementation, in order to maximize the potential for maintaining a diverse, resilient and well-functioning biosphere under the challenging conditions of the twenty-first century. This article is part of the theme issue ‘Climate change and ecosystems: threats, opportunities and solutions’.
256;Health Risks Due To Climate Change: Inequity In Causes And Consequences.;Climate change has altered global to local weather patterns and increased sea levels, and it will continue to do so. Average temperatures, precipitation amounts, and other variables such as humidity levels are all rising. In addition, weather variability is increasing, causing, for example, a greater number of heat waves, many of which are more intense and last longer, and more floods and droughts. These changes are collectively increasing the number of injuries, illnesses, and deaths from a wide range of climate-sensitive health outcomes. Future health risks will be determined not just by the hazards created by a changing climate but also by the sensitivity of individuals and communities exposed to these hazards and the capacity of health systems to prepare for and effectively manage the attendant risks. These risks include deaths and injuries from extreme events (for example, heat waves, storms, and floods), infectious diseases (including food-, water-, and vectorborne illnesses), and food and water insecurity. These risks are unevenly distributed and both create new inequities and exacerbate those that already exist. Most of these risks are projected to increase with each additional unit of warming. Using an equity lens to move beyond incremental to transformational resilience would reduce vulnerability and improve sustainability for all, but substantial additional funding is required for proactive and effective actions by the health system.
257;Environmental and Health Impacts of Air Pollution: A Review;"One of our era's greatest scourges is air pollution, on account not only of its impact on climate change but also its impact on public and individual health due to increasing morbidity and mortality. There are many pollutants that are major factors in disease in humans. Among them, Particulate Matter (PM), particles of variable but very small diameter, penetrate the respiratory system via inhalation, causing respiratory and cardiovascular diseases, reproductive and central nervous system dysfunctions, and cancer. Despite the fact that ozone in the stratosphere plays a protective role against ultraviolet irradiation, it is harmful when in high concentration at ground level, also affecting the respiratory and cardiovascular system. Furthermore, nitrogen oxide, sulfur dioxide, Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs), dioxins, and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are all considered air pollutants that are harmful to humans. Carbon monoxide can even provoke direct poisoning when breathed in at high levels. Heavy metals such as lead, when absorbed into the human body, can lead to direct poisoning or chronic intoxication, depending on exposure. Diseases occurring from the aforementioned substances include principally respiratory problems such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), asthma, bronchiolitis, and also lung cancer, cardiovascular events, central nervous system dysfunctions, and cutaneous diseases. Last but not least, climate change resulting from environmental pollution affects the geographical distribution of many infectious diseases, as do natural disasters. The only way to tackle this problem is through public awareness coupled with a multidisciplinary approach by scientific experts; national and international organizations must address the emergence of this threat and propose sustainable solutions."
258;Understanding the Spectrum of Anxiety Responses to Climate Change: A Systematic Review of the Qualitative Literature;Background: Knowledge about climate change may produce anxiety, but the concept of climate change anxiety is poorly understood. The primary aim of this study was to systematically review the qualitative literature regarding the scope of anxiety responses to climate change. The secondary aim was to investigate the sociodemographic and geographical factors which influence experiences of climate change anxiety. Methods: A systematic review of empirical qualitative studies was undertaken, examining the scope of climate change anxiety by searching five databases. Studies were critically appraised for quality. Content analysis was used to identify themes. Results: Fifteen studies met the inclusion criteria. The content analysis was organised into two overarching themes. The scope of anxiety included worry about threats to livelihood, worry for future generations, worry about apocalyptic futures, anxiety at the lack of response to climate change, and competing worries. Themes pertaining to responses to climate change anxiety included symptoms of anxiety, feeling helpless and disempowered, and ways of managing climate change anxiety. Relatively few studies were identified, with limited geographical diversity amongst the populations studied. Conclusions: The review furthers understanding of the concept of climate change anxiety and responses to it, highlighting the need for high-quality psychiatric research exploring its clinical significance and potential interventions.
259;Global Climate Change and Children’s Health;Rising global temperature is causing major physical, chemical, and ecological changes across the planet. There is wide consensus among scientific organizations and climatologists that these broad effects, known as climate change, are the result of contemporary human activity. Climate change poses threats to human health, safety, and security. Children are uniquely vulnerable to these threats. The effects of climate change on child health include physical and psychological sequelae of weather disasters, increased heat stress, decreased air quality, altered disease patterns of some climate-sensitive infections, and food, water, and nutrient insecurity in vulnerable regions. Prompt implementation of mitigation and adaptation strategies will protect children against worsening of the problem and its associated health effects. This technical report reviews the nature of climate change and its associated child health effects and supports the recommendations in the accompanying policy statement on climate change and children’s health.
260;Climate Change Impacts on Health in Remote Indigenous Communities in Australia;"ABSTRACT Human-induced climate change in Australia is affecting the frequency and intensity of extreme events, including bushfires, cyclones and drought. Human health is affected by these climate impacts through direct impacts which include injuries and death from extreme events; indirect impacts through natural system changes such as impacts on water, food and air; and indirect impacts on human systems including mental health, productivity, and damage to housing and health-care facilities. Remote settlements are vulnerable to these climate impacts and associated health impacts due to isolated location, quality of the infrastructure, economic resources, limited transport, and existing health vulnerabilities that enable resilience or vulnerability. Remote Indigenous communities are particularly vulnerable. This research sought to identify vulnerabilities of human health of residents in remote Indigenous communities to human-induced climate change to contribute to adequate responses of prevention and preparation."
261;Climate change, conflict and health;"Summary Future climate change is predicted to diminish essential natural resource availability in many regions and perhaps globally. The resulting scarcity of water, food and livelihoods could lead to increasingly desperate populations that challenge governments, enhancing the risk of intra- and interstate conflict. Defence establishments and some political scientists view climate change as a potential threat to peace. While the medical literature increasingly recognises climate change as a fundamental health risk, the dimension of climate change-associated conflict has so far received little attention, despite its profound health implications. Many analysts link climate change with a heightened risk of conflict via causal pathways which involve diminishing or changing resource availability. Plausible consequences include: increased frequency of civil conflict in developing countries; terrorism, asymmetric warfare, state failure; and major regional conflicts. The medical understanding of these threats is inadequate, given the scale of health implications. The medical and public health communities have often been reluctant to interpret conflict as a health issue. However, at times, medical workers have proven powerful and effective peace advocates, most notably with regard to nuclear disarmament. The public is more motivated to mitigate climate change when it is framed as a health issue. Improved medical understanding of the association between climate change and conflict could strengthen mitigation efforts and increase cooperation to cope with the climate change that is now inevitable."
262;European Union policies and their role in combating climate change over the years;The worrying environmental situation and increased public awareness in recent years have led many countries to take measures to reduce negative impacts on the environment. The European Union (EU) has been one of the most active in environmental protection with the formulation of policies aimed at preserving the health and well-being of citizens and protecting natural resources. One of the objectives of environmental policies is to make the economy of its member states more environmentally friendly, although this requires finding solutions to major challenges such as climate change, the scarcity of natural resources, the emission of polluting gases, and unsustainable consumption and production. This article reviews the main policies that have been implemented in the EU to reduce environmental problems and the scope of climate change conferences. It offers solutions to promote sustainability that could be adopted by companies, individuals, and governmental institutions to jointly contribute to achieving a more sustainable world, where problems such as climate change or the emission of polluting gases are minimized. The aim is to follow the principles of the Circular Economy and the European Green Deal.

264;Global climate change and greenhouse effect;The climate has changed significantly under the influence of human behavior. And first of all, this is due to the change in the proportionality and concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere (water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, ozone, PFC (perfluorocarbons). This paper analyzes the dynamics of greenhouse gas emissions. Climate change has many consequences on human health throughout the world, especially in African countries. The growth of greenhouse gas emissions is viewed as a cause of infectious and non-infectious diseases, negative effects on nutrition, water security and other social disruptions. The global average temperature gradually increases, and the atmospheric CO2 concentration has exceeded 400 ppm due to the intensification of greenhouse effect. The method of energy balance was featured to simulate the trends in Greenhouse Gas Emission Forecast in different sectors until 2030. Through sensitivity analysis, we found that the reduction of anthropogenic CO2 emissions from people (cars and households) would deescalate the consequences of the above trends. Emissions are mostly associated with industries, which can be reduced if local Government will want to achieve the Paris Agreement goal.
265;The Synergistic Relationship Between Climate Change and the HIV/AIDS Epidemic: A Conceptual Framework;Climate change and HIV/AIDS represent two of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. However, limitations in understanding the complex relationship between these syndemics continue to constrain advancements in the prevention and management of HIV/AIDS in the context of a rapidly changing climate. Here, we present a conceptual framework that identifies four pathways linking climate change with HIV/AIDS transmission and health outcomes: increased food insecurity, increased prevalence of other infectious diseases, increased human migration, and erosion of public health infrastructure. This framework is based on an in-depth literature review in PubMed and Google Scholar from June 6 to June 27, 2019. The pathways linking climate change with HIV transmission and health outcomes are complex with multiple interacting factors. Food insecurity emerged as a particularly important mediator by driving sexual risk-taking behaviours and migration, as well as by increasing susceptibility to infections that are common among people living with HIV (PLWHIV). Future interventions should focus on decreasing carbon dioxide emissions globally and increasing education and investment in adaptation strategies, particularly in those areas of sub-Saharan Africa and southeast Asia heavily impacted by both HIV and climate change. Environmentally sustainable interventions such as urban gardening and investing in sustainable agriculture technologies also have significant health co-benefits that may help PLWHIV adapt to the environmental consequences of climate change.
266;Charting the evidence for climate change impacts on the global spread of malaria and dengue and adaptive responses: a scoping review of reviews;Background Climate change is expected to alter the global footprint of many infectious diseases, particularly vector-borne diseases such as malaria and dengue. Knowledge of the range and geographical context of expected climate change impacts on disease transmission and spread, combined with knowledge of effective adaptation strategies and responses, can help to identify gaps and best practices to mitigate future health impacts. To investigate the types of evidence for impacts of climate change on two major mosquito-borne diseases of global health importance, malaria and dengue, and to identify the range of relevant policy responses and adaptation strategies that have been devised, we performed a scoping review of published review literature. Three electronic databases (PubMed, Scopus and Epistemonikos) were systematically searched for relevant published reviews. Inclusion criteria were: reviews with a systematic search, from 2007 to 2020, in English or French, that addressed climate change impacts and/or adaptation strategies related to malaria and/or dengue. Data extracted included: characteristics of the article, type of review, disease(s) of focus, geographic focus, and nature of the evidence. The evidence was summarized to identify and compare regional evidence for climate change impacts and adaptation measures. Results A total of 32 reviews met the inclusion criteria. Evidence for the impacts of climate change (including climate variability) on dengue was greatest in the Southeast Asian region, while evidence for the impacts of climate change on malaria was greatest in the African region, particularly in highland areas. Few reviews explicitly addressed the implementation of adaptation strategies to address climate change-driven disease transmission, however suggested strategies included enhanced surveillance, early warning systems, predictive models and enhanced vector control. Conclusions There is strong evidence for the impacts of climate change, including climate variability, on the transmission and future spread of malaria and dengue, two of the most globally important vector-borne diseases. Further efforts are needed to develop multi-sectoral climate change adaptation strategies to enhance the capacity and resilience of health systems and communities, especially in regions with predicted climatic suitability for future emergence and re-emergence of malaria and dengue. This scoping review may serve as a useful precursor to inform future systematic reviews of the primary literature.
267;A Systematic Literature Review of Factors Affecting the Timing of Menarche: The Potential for Climate Change to Impact Women’s Health;Menarche is the first occurrence of a woman’s menstruation, an event that symbolizes reproductive capacity and the transition from childhood into womanhood. The global average age for menarche is 12 years and this has been declining in recent years. Many factors that affect the timing menarche in girls could be affected by climate change. A systematic literature review was performed regarding the timing of menarche and four publication databases were interrogated: EMBASE, SCOPUS, PubMed, and Cochrane Reviews. Themes were identified from 112 articles and related to environmental causes of perturbations in menarche (either early or late), disease causes and consequences of perturbations, and social causes and consequences. Research from climatology was incorporated to describe how climate change events, including increased hurricanes, avalanches/mudslides/landslides, and extreme weather events could alter the age of menarche by disrupting food availability or via increased toxin/pollutant release. Overall, our review revealed that these perturbations in the timing of menarche are likely to increase the disease burden for women in four key areas: mental health, fertility-related conditions, cardiovascular disease, and bone health. In summary, the climate does have the potential to impact women’s health through perturbation in the timing of menarche and this, in turn, will affect women’s risk of disease in future.
268;Climate change and antibiotic resistance: a deadly combination;Climate change is driven primarily by humanity’s use of fossil fuels and the resultant greenhouse gases from their combustion. The effects of climate change on human health are myriad and becomingly increasingly severe as the pace of climate change accelerates. One relatively underreported intersection between health and climate change is that of infections, particularly antibiotic-resistant infections. In this perspective review, the aspects of climate change that have already, will, and could possibly impact the proliferation and dissemination of antibiotic resistance are discussed.
269;Using Detection And Attribution To Quantify How Climate Change Is Affecting Health.;The question of whether, how, and to what extent climate change is affecting health is central to many climate and health studies. We describe a set of formal methods, termed detection and attribution, used by climatologists to determine whether a climate trend or extreme event has changed and to estimate the extent to which climate change influenced that change. We discuss events where changing weather patterns were attributed to climate change and extend these analyses to include health impacts from heat waves in 2018 and 2019 in Europe and Japan, and we show how such impact attribution could be applied to melting ice roads in the Arctic. Documenting the causal chain from emissions of greenhouse gases to observed human health outcomes is important input into risk assessments that prioritize health system preparedness and response interventions and into financial investments and communication about potential risk to policy makers and to the public.
270;Climate Change as a Social Determinant of Health;* Abbreviations:  AAP — : American Academy of Pediatrics  SDOH — : social determinant of health  Social determinants of health (SDOHs), defined as the social circumstances in which people are born, grow, live, work, and play, profoundly affect children’s health and drive health disparities.1 SDOHs are shaped by the distribution of money, power, and resources at global, national, and local levels. The list of potential SDOHs is expansive and includes food insecurity, housing instability, violence exposure, structural racism, poverty, and immigration-related stressors. Addressing SDOHs within the pediatric medical home has garnered considerable interest lately as a potential solution to both improving health across the life course and mitigating health care costs.1 However, one critical determinant is missing from the pediatric community’s definition of SDOHs: climate change.  Climate change (also called global warming) is arguably one of the greatest public health threats of our time. Climate change is caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions from human activity, resulting in higher global average temperatures and changes to environmental and human systems. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) issued a policy statement in 2007 (revised in 2015) encouraging pediatricians to reduce carbon emissions and support families experiencing the effects of climate change.2 We agree with this call to action. However, given the current national focus of policymakers, funders, and health care systems on addressing SDOHs, along with the ubiquitous impact of the changing climate on the social and environmental circumstances in which children live, we recommend climate …   Address correspondence to Maya I.

271;Analysis and valuation of the health and climate change cobenefits of dietary change;Significance The food system is responsible for more than a quarter of all greenhouse gas emissions while unhealthy diets and high body weight are among the greatest contributors to premature mortality. Our study provides a comparative analysis of the health and climate change benefits of global dietary changes for all major world regions. We project that health and climate change benefits will both be greater the lower the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Three quarters of all benefits occur in developing countries although the per capita impacts of dietary change would be greatest in developed countries. The monetized value of health improvements could be comparable with, and possibly larger than, the environmental benefits of the avoided damages from climate change. What we eat greatly influences our personal health and the environment we all share. Recent analyses have highlighted the likely dual health and environmental benefits of reducing the fraction of animal-sourced foods in our diets. Here, we couple for the first time, to our knowledge, a region-specific global health model based on dietary and weight-related risk factors with emissions accounting and economic valuation modules to quantify the linked health and environmental consequences of dietary changes. We find that the impacts of dietary changes toward less meat and more plant-based diets vary greatly among regions. The largest absolute environmental and health benefits result from diet shifts in developing countries whereas Western high-income and middle-income countries gain most in per capita terms. Transitioning toward more plant-based diets that are in line with standard dietary guidelines could reduce global mortality by 6–10% and food-related greenhouse gas emissions by 29–70% compared with a reference scenario in 2050. We find that the monetized value of the improvements in health would be comparable with, or exceed, the value of the environmental benefits although the exact valuation method used considerably affects the estimated amounts. Overall, we estimate the economic benefits of improving diets to be 1–31 trillion US dollars, which is equivalent to 0.4–13% of global gross domestic product (GDP) in 2050. However, significant changes in the global food system would be necessary for regional diets to match the dietary patterns studied here.
272;Climate Change and Global Health;Two of the most pressing issues of our time, climate change and health, are addressed with exceptional scholarship and clarity in this new volume edited by Prof Colin D Butler of the Faculty of Health at the University of Canberra, Australia. Unusual for a multi-author book where disciplinary diversity is required is its coherence and evidential thoroughness. This is no small tribute to the broad grasp of the complex science tackled and marshalled by the editor and his advisors. The legacy that the late Prof AJ (Tony) McMichael, pioneer of climate change and health epidemiology, provides the book in one of its chapters and through the contributions of his successors is plainly evident. He progressed the notion that the present geological epoch as Anthropocene, one where human enterprise began to match the forces of nature (Crutzen in 2004 and Steffen in 2007), is of major health relevance. Indeed, as Steffen asserts in the present volume, it is now possible that, on this account, the earth may enter an irreversible warmer era, with all if its dire consequences. In the meantime, the authors adduce the primary, secondary and tertiary health effects already underway in various regions. The biomedical, psychosocial and environmental health threats we face are cogently elaborated. What of food and health? Throughout the publication we are caused to think how closely food and health security move together. The ecological basis of health is undergoing a momentous natural experiment which must be recognised and acted upon through population , resource ad conflict management in order to survive long enough for sufficient planetary recovery to occur. This is a book with content for all food, nutritional and health professionals to assimilate.
273;Climate Change and the Practice of Medicine: Essentials for Resident Education.;Despite calls for including content on climate change and its effect on health in curricula across the spectrum of medical education, no widely used resource exists to guide residency training programs in this effort. This lack of resources poses challenges for training program leaders seeking to incorporate evidence-based climate and health content into their curricula. Climate change increases risks of heat-related illness, infections, asthma, mental health disorders, poor perinatal outcomes, adverse experiences from trauma and displacement, and other harms. More numerous and increasingly dangerous natural disasters caused by climate change impair delivery of care by disrupting supply chains and compromising power supplies. Graduating trainees face a knowledge gap in understanding, managing, and mitigating these many-faceted consequences of climate change, which-expected to intensify in coming decades-will influence both the health of their patients and the health care they deliver. In this article, the authors propose a framework of climate change and health educational content for residents, including how climate change (1) harms health, (2) necessitates adaptation in clinical practice, and (3) undermines health care delivery. The authors propose not only learning objectives linked to the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies for resident education, but also learning formats and assessment strategies in each content area. They also present opportunities for implementation of climate and health education in residency training programs. Including this content in residency education will better prepare doctors to deliver anticipatory guidance to at-risk patients, manage those experiencing climate-related health effects, and reduce care disruptions during climate-driven extreme weather events.
274;Assessing Health Vulnerabilities and Adaptation to Climate Change: A Review of International Progress;Climate change is increasing risks to human health and to the health systems that seek to protect the safety and well-being of populations. Health authorities require information about current associations between health outcomes and weather or climate, vulnerable populations, projections of future risks and adaptation opportunities in order to reduce exposures, empower individuals to take needed protective actions and build climate-resilient health systems. An increasing number of health authorities from local to national levels seek this information by conducting climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments. While assessments can provide valuable information to plan for climate change impacts, the results of many studies are not helping to build the global evidence-base of knowledge in this area. They are also often not integrated into adaptation decision making, sometimes because the health sector is not involved in climate change policy making processes at the national level. Significant barriers related to data accessibility, a limited number of climate and health models, uncertainty in climate projections, and a lack of funding and expertise, particularly in developing countries, challenge health authority efforts to conduct rigorous assessments and apply the findings. This paper examines the evolution of climate change and health vulnerability and adaptation assessments, including guidance developed for such projects, the number of assessments that have been conducted globally and implementation of the findings to support health adaptation action. Greater capacity building that facilitates assessments from local to national scales will support collaborative efforts to protect health from current climate hazards and future climate change. Health sector officials will benefit from additional resources and partnership opportunities to ensure that evidence about climate change impacts on health is effectively translated into needed actions to build health resilience.
275;Estimating The Costs Of Inaction And The Economic Benefits Of Addressing The Health Harms Of Climate Change.;National and international assessments have drawn attention to the substantial economic risks of climate change. The costs of climate-sensitive health outcomes responsive to meteorological or seasonal patterns are among the least studied of those risks. In this article we describe how cost valuation analyses that relate climate-sensitive health outcomes to damages in economic terms can illuminate the costs of inaction on the climate crisis and the economic savings of addressing this problem. We identify major challenges to expanding the application of climate-health valuation research and suggest solutions to overcome these obstacles to better characterize the burden of climate-sensitive health outcomes and health disparities. The projected health and economic harms of climate-sensitive risks could be enormous if climate change continues to accelerate and communities are not prepared to reduce or prevent their impact. Expanded valuation of climate-sensitive health outcomes can inform policies that slow climate change and promote stronger investments in health-protective climate change adaptation efforts.
276;Climate change glossary for public health practice: from vulnerability to climate justice;Climate change is an emerging and growing field of practice for the international public health community. As practitioners, researchers and policy-makers grapple with the local health impacts of climate change, there is an increasing need to clarify key terminology to support public health actors engage and respond in ways that promote intersectoral collaboration. This contribution introduces the public health discourse on climate change, with a particular focus on its implications for health equity. After defining key terms and existing adaptation practices, climate justice and assets-oriented inquiry into the intersectional determinants of health are discussed as future opportunities for addressing health equity in climate and health-related research and practice.
277;Impacts of climate change on future air quality and human health in China;Significance More intense extreme events are projected under future climate change. However, the impacts of climate extremes on future air quality and associated health implications are not well recognized and are rarely quantified in China, with an enormous health burden from air pollution. Here, we estimate the climate-driven air pollution mortality in China and find that future climate change is likely to exacerbate air pollution mortality, largely influenced by the more intense extreme events such as stagnation events and heat waves. Our analysis provides quantitative assessments and insights regarding the links between climate extremes, future air quality, and public health, suggesting that extreme weather events may be an important mechanism by which climate change will affect air quality, and especially fine particulate matter. In recent years, air pollution has caused more than 1 million deaths per year in China, making it a major focus of public health efforts. However, future climate change may exacerbate such human health impacts by increasing the frequency and duration of weather conditions that enhance air pollution exposure. Here, we use a combination of climate, air quality, and epidemiological models to assess future air pollution deaths in a changing climate under Representative Concentration Pathway 4.5 (RCP4.5). We find that, assuming pollution emissions and population are held constant at current levels, climate change would adversely affect future air quality for >85% of China’s population (∼55% of land area) by the middle of the century, and would increase by 3% and 4% the population-weighted average concentrations of fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and ozone, respectively. As a result, we estimate an additional 12,100 and 8,900 Chinese (95% confidence interval: 10,300 to 13,800 and 2,300 to 14,700, respectively) will die per year from PM2.5 and ozone exposure, respectively. The important underlying climate mechanisms are changes in extreme conditions such as atmospheric stagnation and heat waves (contributing 39% and 6%, respectively, to the increase in mortality). Additionally, greater vulnerability of China’s aging population will further increase the estimated deaths from PM2.5 and ozone in 2050 by factors of 1 and 3, respectively. Our results indicate that climate change and more intense extremes are likely to increase the risk of severe pollution events in China. Managing air quality in China in a changing climate will thus become more challenging.
278;Climate change adaptation in South Africa: a case study on the role of the health sector;BackgroundGlobally, the response to climate change is gradually gaining momentum as the impacts of climate change unfold. In South Africa, it is increasingly apparent that delays in responding to climate change over the past decades have jeopardized human life and livelihoods. While slow progress with mitigation, especially in the energy sector, has garnered much attention, focus is now shifting to developing plans and systems to adapt to the impacts of climate change.MethodsWe applied systematic review methods to assess progress with climate change adaptation in the health sector in South Africa. This case study provides useful lessons which could be applied in other countries in the African region, or globally. We reviewed the literature indexed in PubMed and Web of Science, together with relevant grey literature. We included articles describing adaptation interventions to reduce the impact of climate change on health in South Africa. All study designs were eligible. Data from included articles and grey literature were summed thematically.ResultsOf the 820 publications screened, 21 were included, together with an additional xx papers. Very few studies presented findings of an intervention or used high-quality research designs. Several policy frameworks for climate change have been developed at national and local government levels. These, however, pay little attention to health concerns and the specific needs of vulnerable groups. Systems for forecasting extreme weather, and tracking malaria and other infections appear well established. Yet, there is little evidence about the country’s preparedness for extreme weather events, or the ability of the already strained health system to respond to these events. Seemingly, few adaptation measures have taken place in occupational and other settings. To date, little attention has been given to climate change in training curricula for health workers.ConclusionsOverall, the volume and quality of research is disappointing, and disproportionate to the threat posed by climate change in South Africa. This is surprising given that the requisite expertise for policy advocacy, identifying effective interventions and implementing systems-based approaches rests within the health sector. More effective use of data, a traditional strength of health professionals, could support adaptation and promote accountability of the state. With increased health-sector leadership, climate change could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent, adequately-resourced response. Such a shift in South Africa, but also beyond the country, may play a key role in accelerating climate change adaptation and mitigation.
279;Integrating Public Health into Climate Change Policy and Planning: State of Practice Update;"Policy action in the coming decade will be crucial to achieving globally agreed upon goals to decarbonize the economy and build resilience to a warmer, more extreme climate. Public health has an essential role in climate planning and action: “Co-benefits” to health help underpin greenhouse gas reduction strategies, while safeguarding health—particularly of the most vulnerable—is a frontline local adaptation goal. Using the structure of the core functions and essential services (CFES), we reviewed the literature documenting the evolution of public health’s role in climate change action since the 2009 launch of the US CDC Climate and Health Program. We found that the public health response to climate change has been promising in the area of assessment (monitoring climate hazards, diagnosing health status, assessing vulnerability); mixed in the area of policy development (mobilizing partnerships, mitigation and adaptation activities); and relatively weak in assurance (communication, workforce development and evaluation). We suggest that the CFES model remains important, but is not aligned with three concepts—governance, implementation and adjustment—that have taken on increasing importance. Adding these concepts to the model can help ensure that public health fulfills its potential as a proactive partner fully integrated into climate policy planning and action in the coming decade."
280;Perceptions of climate change and its impact on human health: an integrated quantitative and qualitative approach;"Background The World Health Organization emphasized that climate change is a significant and emerging threat to public health, especially in lower income populations and tropical/subtropical countries. However, people in Asia and Africa were the least likely to perceive global warming as a threat. In Vietnam, little research has been conducted concerning the perceptions of effects of climate change on human health. Objective The aim of this study was to explore the perceptions on climate change and its impact on human health among people in Hanoi. Design We applied a combined quantitative and qualitative approach to study perceptions on climate change among people in Hanoi. A total of 1,444 people were recruited, including 754 people living in non-slum areas and 690 people living in slum areas of Hanoi. A structured questionnaire was used to collect quantitative data on their perceptions. In a parallel qualitative study, two focus group discussions and 12 in-depth interviews (IDs) were carried out involving 24 people from both slum and non-slum areas. Results The majority of the respondents in the study had heard about climate change and its impact on human health (79.3 and 70.1% in non-slum and slum areas, respectively). About one third of the respondents reported that members of their family had experienced illness in the recent summer and winter compared to the same seasons 5 years ago. The most common symptoms reported during hot weather were headaches, fatigue, and dizziness; hypertension and other cardiovascular diseases were also reported. During cold weather, people reported experiencing cough, fever, and influenza, as well as pneumonia and emerging infectious diseases such as dengue and Japanese encephalitis. Conclusions The observed high level of awareness on the links between climate change and human health may help to increase the success of the National Prevention Program on Climate Change. Moreover, understanding the concerns of the people may help policy makers to develop and implement effective and sustainable adaptation measures for Hanoi City as well as for Vietnam as a whole."
281;Environmental effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, UV radiation, and interactions with climate change: UNEP Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, Update 2021;The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel of the Montreal Protocol under the United Nations Environment Programme evaluates effects on the environment and human health that arise from changes in the stratospheric ozone layer and concomitant variations in ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the Earth’s surface. The current update is based on scientific advances that have accumulated since our last assessment (Photochem and Photobiol Sci 20(1):1–67, 2021). We also discuss how climate change affects stratospheric ozone depletion and ultraviolet radiation, and how stratospheric ozone depletion affects climate change. The resulting interlinking effects of stratospheric ozone depletion, UV radiation, and climate change are assessed in terms of air quality, carbon sinks, ecosystems, human health, and natural and synthetic materials. We further highlight potential impacts on the biosphere from extreme climate events that are occurring with increasing frequency as a consequence of climate change. These and other interactive effects are examined with respect to the benefits that the Montreal Protocol and its Amendments are providing to life on Earth by controlling the production of various substances that contribute to both stratospheric ozone depletion and climate change.
282;Synergistic Effects of Climate Change and Marine Pollution: An Overlooked Interaction in Coastal and Estuarine Areas;Coastal areas have been increasingly affected by human activities, marine pollution and climate change are among the most important pressures affecting these environments. Human-induced pressures occur in a cumulative way and generate additive, antagonistic or synergistic effects. Knowledge on synergistic effects is crucial to coastal zone management, since they may imply a change in human uses of these systems, as well as dedicated action plans in order to reduce hazards and environmental risks. In this work, we provide an overview of the available literature on synergistic effects between climate change and chemical pollution, and discuss current knowledge, methodological approaches, and research gaps and needs. Interactions between these two pressures may be climate change dominant (climate change leads to an increase in contaminant exposure or toxicity) or contaminant-dominant (chemical exposure leads to an increase in climate change susceptibility), but the mechanistic drivers of such processes are not well known. Results from a few meta-analyses studies and reviews showed that synergistic interactions tend to be more frequent compared to additive and antagonistic ones. However, most of the studies are individual-based and assess the cumulative effects of a few contaminants individually in laboratory settings together with few climate variables, particularly temperature and pH. Nevertheless, a wide diversity of contaminants have already been individually tested, spanning from metals, persistent organic pollutants and, more recently, emergent pollutants. Population and community based approaches are less frequent but have generated very interesting and more holistic perspectives. Methodological approaches are quite diverse, from laboratory studies to mesocosm and field studies, or based on statistical or modelling tools, each with their own potential and limitations. More holistic comparisons integrating several pressures and their combinations and a multitude of habitats, taxa, life-stages, among others, are needed, as well as insights from meta-analyses and systematic reviews.
283;Earth as humans' habitat: global climate change and the health of populations.;Human-induced climate change, with such rapid and continuing global-scale warming, is historically unprecedented and signifies that human pressures on Earth's life-supporting natural systems now exceed the planet's bio-geo-capacity. The risks from climate change to health and survival in populations are diverse, as are the social and political ramifications. Although attributing observed health changes in a population to the recent climatic change is difficult, a coherent pattern of climate- and weather-associated changes is now evident in many regions of the world. The risks impinge unevenly, especially on poorer and vulnerable regions, and are amplified by pre-existing high rates of climate-sensitive diseases and conditions. If, as now appears likely, the world warms by 3-5oC by 2100, the health consequences, directly and via massive social and economic disruption, will be severe. The health sector has an important message to convey, comparing the health risks and benefits of enlightened action to avert climate change and to achieve sustainable ways of living versus the self-interested or complacent inaction.
284;Climate Change, Human Health, and Social Stability: Addressing Interlinkages;Background: Abundant historical evidence demonstrates how environmental changes can affect social stability and, in turn, human health. A rapidly growing body of literature, largely from political science and economics, is examining the potential for and consequences associated with social instability related to current climate change. However, comparatively little of this research incorporates the effects on human health or the role of health systems in influencing the magnitude and types of instability that could occur. Objective: The objective of this commentary is to articulate a conceptual framework incorporating health outcomes and health systems into theorized and observed linkages between climate change and social instability, illustrating in particular the health effects of natural resource shortages, infectious disease outbreaks, and migration. Discussion: Although increasing evidence exists that climate change, health, and social instability are related, key questions remain about the pathways linking these factors, as well as the magnitude, causality, and directionality of relationships across spatial and temporal scales. Models seeking to explain and predict climate-related social unrest should incorporate the many linkages between climate change, human health, and social instability. Members of the environmental health research community should work closely with those in the political science and economics communities to help deepen understandings of climate-related stressors and shocks that affect instability and worsen health outcomes. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP4534
285;Climate Change - A Health Emergency.;Climate Change — A Health Emergency The effects of climate disruption are fundamentally health issues. As physicians, we have a special responsibility to safeguard health and alleviate suffering, and individual actions are far from enough to address the challenge we collectively face.
286;The 2019 report of the MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change: a turbulent year with mixed progress;"The MJA–Lancet Countdown on health and climate change was established in 2017 and produced its first Australian national assessment in 2018. It examined 41 indicators across five broad domains: climate change impacts, exposures and vulnerability; adaptation, planning and resilience for health; mitigation actions and health co‐benefits; economics and finance; and public and political engagement. It found that, overall, Australia is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change on health, and that policy inaction in this regard threatens Australian lives. In this report we present the 2019 update. We track progress on health and climate change in Australia across the same five broad domains and many of the same indicators as in 2018. A number of new indicators are introduced this year, including one focused on wildfire exposure, and another on engagement in health and climate change in the corporate sector. Several of the previously reported indicators are not included this year, either due to their discontinuation by the parent project, the Lancet Countdown, or because insufficient new data were available for us to meaningfully provide an update to the indicator. In a year marked by an Australian federal election in which climate change featured prominently, we find mixed progress on health and climate change in this country. There has been progress in renewable energy generation, including substantial employment increases in this sector. There has also been some progress at state and local government level. However, there continues to be no engagement on health and climate change in the Australian federal Parliament, and Australia performs poorly across many of the indicators in comparison to other developed countries; for example, it is one of the world's largest net exporters of coal and its electricity generation from low carbon sources is low. We also find significantly increasing exposure of Australians to heatwaves and, in most states and territories, continuing elevated suicide rates at higher temperatures. We conclude that Australia remains at significant risk of declines in health due to climate change, and that substantial and sustained national action is urgently required in order to prevent this."
287;Commentary - Climate change, health and green space co-benefits.;We examined two of humanity's present-day challenges, climate change and chronic diseases, in relation to the co-benefits that green spaces provide to human health and the environment. The reduction of several chronic diseases and associated symptoms, including anxiety, obesity and cardiovascular disease, has been associated with the presence of and access to green space. Green spaces also contribute to a number of environmental health benefits and have been shown to reduce the likelihood of flooding, improve air quality and provide cooling and shade. These co-benefits address both the symptoms of several chronic diseases and associated risk factors along with the environmental and health impacts of climate change. This article explores how to maximize the co-benefits of green spaces through two examples of multi-sectoral collaborations. With these two examples, we have provided a model of collective collaboration that aims to address complex issues, such as climate change and chronic diseases, through the common intervention of green spaces.
288;Climate change: an urgent priority for health policy and systems research;"Climate change is the defining global public health threat of the twenty-first century (Whitmee et al., 2015; WHO, 2018; Watts et al., 2019) and has profound implications for nearly every aspect of health. The ongoing COVID-19 crisis is causing unprecedented disruptions to health systems, but climate change will have even greater—much greater—consequences. Yet health policy and systems researchers largely continue to ignore and overlook climate change. This is a critical oversight. Countries with the greatest vulnerability to climate change have the least developed health systems (Salas and Jha, 2019), and climate change will further compound and exacerbate existing inequalities (Costello et al., 2009). Health policy and systems research (HPSR) is well positioned to accelerate the needed response and transformation (Peters, 2018). HPSR could make countless contributions to address the climate challenge. We highlight three interlinked reasons, which should motivate the HPSR community to prioritize a focus on climate change. First, HPSR is crucial to understanding the impact and implications of climate change. HPSR seeks to analyse how different actors interact in policy and implementation processes to improve health outcomes. It draws on a blend of public health, economics, sociology, anthropology, political science and epidemiology and can serve as a multidisciplinary bridge to these various fields. HPSR seeks to analyse how health systems respond and adapt to health policies, and how health policies can shape and be shaped by health systems and broader determinants of health like climate change (AHPSR, 2007). The interdisciplinary nature of HPSR makes it well positioned to tackle the complexity of climate change and can improve the analysis of linkages between health and climate. Until now, the climate change and health literature have focused on infectious diseases (Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum, 2012), along with deaths and injuries from extreme weather events, the adverse health effects of extreme heat (Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum, 2012), and risks of under-nutrition due to declines in food yields (Friel et al., 2011; Hosking and Campbell-Lendrum, 2012; Xie et al., 2018). These studies show how climate change affects health outcomes; HPSR could augment ongoing efforts and widen this understanding by applying a systems approach. There is an urgent need to take a broader health systems and health policies perspective; this is the role of the HPSR community. Researchers can help policymakers appreciate, anticipate and work to prevent the effects of climate change on human health and well-being. For example, most efforts to achieve primary health care (PHC) do not sufficiently consider the implications of the climate crisis (Kadandale et al., 2020). There is a need to revise the discourse, policy and practice on efforts to achieve PHC, but also universal health coverage to include explicit consideration of climate change and its health effects. Second, HPSR is essential to developing and designing both climate change mitigation and adaptation policies within the health sector. It can also help policymakers appreciate how to implement these policies. The emergent literature on health systems and climate change considers adaptation (Mayhew and Hanefeld, 2014), but there is comparatively limited work on mitigation, though these will vary by context, with mitigation policies needed urgently in highincome, high-emitting countries and adaptation policies needed in countries with relatively fewer emissions, both approaches are crucial. A 2019 World Health Organization (WHO) survey found that knowledge of the health implications of climate change is shaping policymaking, however, additional financial or human resources are not being allocated to meet the challenge (WHO, 2019). Adequate financial resources, including from climate change funding sources, have not shifted to health budgets. For example, the same survey identified financing as one the main barriers with only 9% of National Adaptation Plans for Health (H-NAP) being fully resourced (WHO, 2019). Addressing this requires strengthening health policymakers’, health workers’ and health institutions’ capacities to adapt to and"
289;Are we ready for it? Health systems preparedness and capacity towards climate change-induced health risks: perspectives of health professionals in Ghana;ABSTRACT Health systems and infrastructure have been suggested to be overwhelmed by the large-scale public health risks from climate change. With weak health systems, the impact is estimated to be far greater in developing countries, which are already over-burdened with poor health outcomes. Yet, there is limited knowledge about the preparedness and capacities of health institutions and professionals in developing countries to respond to climate change health risks. Drawing from the World Health Organization’s framework on health system capacities, effective response and emergency preparedness, and using mixed methods research design, we examined capacities and preparedness of public health professionals in Ghana to manage climate change-health risks and emergencies. Qualitative interviews (n = 20) and quantitative surveys (n = 99) were conducted with health professionals in Savelugu-Nanton and Ada East Districts in Ghana. The study found that, capacity and preparedness of health professionals and institutions to respond to climate change related health emergencies were weak in the study districts. Based on our findings, we recommend the development and implementation of a comprehensive policy on climate change and health to build capacities of health institutions and professionals, improve climate change health research, and increase funding to climate change programmes and activities in local communities.
290;Hands-on Tutorial on a Modeling Framework for Projections of Climate Change Impacts on Health;"Reliable estimates of future health impacts due to climate change are needed to inform and contribute to the design of efficient adaptation and mitigation strategies. However, projecting health burdens associated to specific environmental stressors is a challenging task because of the complex risk patterns and inherent uncertainty of future climate scenarios. These assessments involve multidisciplinary knowledge, requiring expertise in epidemiology, statistics, and climate science, among other subjects. Here, we present a methodologic framework to estimate future health impacts under climate change scenarios based on a defined set of assumptions and advanced statistical techniques developed in time-series analysis in environmental epidemiology. The proposed methodology is illustrated through a step-by-step hands-on tutorial structured in well-defined sections that cover the main methodological steps and essential elements. Each section provides a thorough description of each step, along with a discussion on available analytical options and the rationale on the choices made in the proposed framework. The illustration is complemented with a practical example of study using real-world data and a series of R scripts included as Supplementary Digital Content; http://links.lww.com/EDE/B504, which facilitates its replication and extension on other environmental stressors, outcomes, study settings, and projection scenarios. Users should critically assess the potential modeling alternatives and modify the framework and R code to adapt them to their research on health impact projections."
291;Climate Change, Health and Mosquito-Borne Diseases: Trends and Implications to the Pacific Region;Climate change is known to affect Pacific Island nations in a variety of ways. One of them is by increasing the vulnerability of human health induced by various climate change impacts, which pose an additional burden to the already distressed health systems in the region. This paper explores the associations between climate change and human health on the one hand, and outlines some of the health care challenges posed by a changing climate on the other. In particular, it describes the links between climate variations and the emergence of climate-sensitive infectious diseases, such as the mosquito-borne diseases dengue, chikungunya, and Zika. The paper also presents a summary of the key findings of the research initiatives Climate Change and Prevalence Study of ZIKA Virus Diseases in Fiji and the findings from the World Mosquito Program as two examples of public health action in the Pacific region.
292;Psychometric Properties of the Climate Change Worry Scale;Climate change worry involves primarily verbal-linguistic thoughts about the changes that may occur in the climate system and the possible effects of these changes. Such worry is one of several possible psychological responses (e.g., fear, anxiety, depression, and trauma) to climate change. Within this article, the psychometric development of the ten-item Climate Change Worry Scale (CCWS) is detailed in three studies. The scale was developed to assess proximal worry about climate change rather than social or global impacts. Study 1 provided evidence that the CCWS items were internally consistent, constituted a single factor, and that the facture structure of the items was invariant for men and women. The results from Study 1 also indicated a good fit with a Rasch model of the items. Study 2 affirmed the internal consistency of the CCWS items and indicated that peoples’ responses to the measure were temporally stable over a two-week test–retest interval (r = 0.91). Study 3 provided support for the convergent and divergent validity of the CCWS through its pattern of correlations with several established clinical and weather-related measures. The limitations of the studies and the possible uses of the CCWS were discussed. The current work represents a starting point.
293;Associations between Knowledge of the Causes and Perceived Impacts of Climate Change: A Cross-Sectional Survey of Medical, Public Health and Nursing Students in Universities in China;This study aimed to measure the knowledge and perceptions of medical, public health, and nursing students about climate change and its impacts, and to identify associations between the knowledge and perceptions. Data were from a nationwide cross-sectional survey of 1387 students sampled in five different regional universities in China (April–May 2017). The knowledge and perceptions of the participants were collected by self-administered questionnaires. We found that most respondents believed that climate change is generally “bad” (83%) and bad for human health (88%), while 67% believed that climate change is controllable. The vast majority of respondents acknowledged illness conditions resulting from poor air quality (95%), heat stress (93%), and extreme weather events (91%) as potential impacts of climate change. Nevertheless, only 39% recognized malnutrition as a consequence of food deprivation resulting from climate change. Around 58% of respondents could correctly identify the causes of climate change. The knowledge of the causes of climate change was not associated with the ability to recognize the health consequences of climate change. However, the knowledge of causes of climate change was a significant predictor of increased awareness of the negative impacts of climate change between the medical and nursing students, although this was not the case among their public health counterparts. Poor knowledge about the causes of climate change is evident among students in China. They are able to recognize the direct links between weather events and health, but less likely to understand the consequences involving complicated pathways. Research and training into the underlying mechanisms of health impacts of climate change needs to be strengthened.
294;Monitoring and Evaluation Indicators for Climate Change-Related Health Impacts, Risks, Adaptation, and Resilience;"Climate change poses a range of current and future health risks that health professionals need to understand, track, and manage. However, conventional monitoring and evaluation (M&E) as practiced in the health sector, including the use of indicators, does not adequately serve this purpose. Improved indicators are needed in three broad categories: (1) vulnerability and exposure to climate-related hazards; (2) current impacts and projected risks; and (3) adaptation processes and health system resilience. These indicators are needed at the population level and at the health systems level (including clinical care and public health). Selected indicators must be sensitive, valid, and useful. And they must account for uncertainties about the magnitude and pattern of climate change; the broad range of upstream drivers of climate-sensitive health outcomes; and the complexities of adaptation itself, including institutional learning and knowledge management to inform iterative risk management. Barriers and constraints to implementing such indicators must be addressed, and lessons learned need to be added to the evidence base. This paper describes an approach to climate and health indicators, including characteristics of the indicators, implementation, and research needs."
295;Impact of climate change on animal health and welfare;"Climate is one of many factors with the potential to alter disease states and is expected to exert an overwhelming negative effect on the health of humans and animals (Rabinowitz and Conti, 2013). In addition, several studies suggested that the increase of temperature might reduce mortality and/or improve health and welfare related aspects in humans and livestock living in geographic areas with cold winters (Ballester et al., 2011; Rose et al., 2015).    The effect of climate change on animal health may be either direct or indirect (Figure 1) and may be due primarily to changes in environmental conditions, which include air temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and frequency and magnitude of extreme events (i.e., heat waves, severe droughts, extreme precipitation events, and coastal floods). Although this article focuses on the effects of environmental factors, it should be noted that factors leading to the effects of climate change on health are extremely complex, involving not only environmental forces, but also ecological and social aspects, economical interests, and individual and community behaviors (Forastiere, 2010).              Open in a separate window      Figure 1.      Schematic representation of the impact of climate change on animal health."
296;Factors Influencing the Mental Health Consequences of Climate Change in Canada;"Climate change is increasing risks to the mental health of Canadians. Impacts from a changing climate may outstrip the ability of Canadians and their health-sustaining institutions to adapt effectively and could increase poor mental health outcomes, particularly amongst those most marginalized in society. A scoping review of literature published during 2000–2017 explored risks, impacts, and vulnerabilities related to climate change and mental health. In this commentary, the authors present a new assessment of evidence from this scoping review and highlight factors that influence the capacity to adapt to the mental health consequences of a changing climate. Findings from this assessment reveal eleven key factors that influence the capacity to adapt: social capital; sense of community; government assistance; access to resources; community preparedness; intersectoral/transdisciplinary collaboration; vulnerability and adaptation assessments; communication and outreach; mental health literacy; and culturally relevant resources. Attention to these factors by Canadian decision makers can support proactive and effective management of the mental health consequences of climate change."
297;Lessons learned on teaching a global audience with massive open online courses (MOOCs) on health impacts of climate change: a commentary;BackgroundThe adverse health impacts of climate change are increasing on a global level. However, knowledge about climate change and health is still unavailable to many global citizens, in particular on adaptation measures and co-benefits of health mitigation. Educational technologies, such as massive open online courses (MOOCs), may have a high potential for providing access to information about climate change links to health for a global audience.Main bodyWe developed three MOOCs addressing the link between climate change and health to take advantage of the methodology’s broad reach and accelerate knowledge dissemination on the nexus of climate change and health. The primary objective was to translate an existing face-to-face short course that only reached a few participants on climate change and health into globally accessible learning opportunities. In the following, we share and comment on our lessons learned with the three MOOCs, with a focus on global teaching in the realm of climate change and health.ConclusionsOverall, the three MOOCs attracted a global audience with diverse educational backgrounds, and a large number of participants from low-income countries. Our experience highlights that MOOCs may play a part in global capacity building, potentially for other health-related topics as well, as we have found that our MOOCs have attracted participants within low-resource contexts. MOOCs may be an effective method for teaching and training global students on health topics, in this case on the complex links and dynamics between climate change and health and may further act as an enabler for equitable access to quality education.
298;Tropospheric ozone assessment report: Global ozone metrics for climate change, human health, and crop/ecosystem research;Assessment of spatial and temporal variation in the impacts of ozone on human health, vegetation, and climate requires appropriate metrics. A key component of the Tropospheric Ozone Assessment Report (TOAR) is the consistent calculation of these metrics at thousands of monitoring sites globally. Investigating temporal trends in these metrics required that the same statistical methods be applied across these ozone monitoring sites. The nonparametric Mann-Kendall test (for significant trends) and the Theil-Sen estimator (for estimating the magnitude of trend) were selected to provide robust methods across all sites. This paper provides the scientific underpinnings necessary to better understand the implications of and rationale for selecting a specific TOAR metric for assessing spatial and temporal variation in ozone for a particular impact. The rationale and underlying research evidence that influence the derivation of specific metrics are given. The form of 25 metrics (4 for model-measurement comparison, 5 for characterization of ozone in the free troposphere, 11 for human health impacts, and 5 for vegetation impacts) are described. Finally, this study categorizes health and vegetation exposure metrics based on the extent to which they are determined only by the highest hourly ozone levels, or by a wider range of values. The magnitude of the metrics is influenced by both the distribution of hourly average ozone concentrations at a site location, and the extent to which a particular metric is determined by relatively low, moderate, and high hourly ozone levels. Hence, for the same ozone time series, changes in the distribution of ozone concentrations can result in different changes in the magnitude and direction of trends for different metrics. Thus, dissimilar conclusions about the effect of changes in the drivers of ozone variability (e.g., precursor emissions) on health and vegetation exposure can result from the selection of different metrics.
299;Climate Change, Health and Existential Risks to Civilization: A Comprehensive Review (1989–2013);Background: Anthropogenic global warming, interacting with social and other environmental determinants, constitutes a profound health risk. This paper reports a comprehensive literature review for 1989–2013 (inclusive), the first 25 years in which this topic appeared in scientific journals. It explores the extent to which articles have identified potentially catastrophic, civilization-endangering health risks associated with climate change. Methods: PubMed and Google Scholar were primarily used to identify articles which were then ranked on a three-point scale. Each score reflected the extent to which papers discussed global systemic risk. Citations were also analyzed. Results: Of 2143 analyzed papers 1546 (72%) were scored as one. Their citations (165,133) were 82% of the total. The proportion of annual papers scored as three was initially high, as were their citations but declined to almost zero by 1996, before rising slightly from 2006. Conclusions: The enormous expansion of the literature appropriately reflects increased understanding of the importance of climate change to global health. However, recognition of the most severe, existential, health risks from climate change was generally low. Most papers instead focused on infectious diseases, direct heat effects and other disciplinary-bounded phenomena and consequences, even though scientific advances have long called for more inter-disciplinary collaboration.
300;Farmer’s response to climate change and variability in Ethiopia: A review;"Abstract Ethiopia is one of the most vulnerable countries experiencing drought and floods as a result of climate variability and change. Climate change in the form of higher temperature, reduced rainfall, and increased rainfall variability reduces crop yield and threatens food security in low income and agriculture-based economies. This study reviews impact of climate change and variability, and climate change adaptation strategies employed at farm level in response to perceived changes in temperature and precipitation. Climate change negatively affects agriculture, nutrition, ground water availability, soil organic matter and soil quality, health conditions, growth and poverty. The survey reveals that Ethiopian farmers adopt many strategies in response to climate change. These strategies include “use of improved crop varieties,” “agroforestry practices,” “crop diversification,” “soil conservation practices,” “tree planting,” “off-farm activities,” “irrigation practices,” “adjusting planting dates,” “selling of assets,” “food aid,” and “permanent and temporary migration in search of employment” are the most important adaptation strategies by smallholder farmers. However, “level of education,” “gender,” “age,” “wealth of the head of household,” “access to extension and credit,” “information and climate social capital,” “agroecological settings,” and “temperature” all influence farmer’s choices; “lack of information on adaptation methods,” “financial constraints,” and “lack of access to land” as main barriers to adapt climate change and variability. Another investigator also revealed that farmers living in the dry lowland area perceived more change in climate than farmers in the wet lowland area."
301;The Climate Change, Food Security and Human Health Nexus in Canada: A Framework to Protect Population Health;Climate change impacts on the Canadian food system pose risks to human health. Little attention has been paid to the climate change, food security, and human health nexus, resulting in a number of knowledge gaps regarding food system components that are most vulnerable to climate change. The lack of understanding of key dynamics and possible future impacts challenges the ability of public health officials and partners in other sectors to prepare Canadians for future health risks. A series of literature reviews were conducted to establish the relationship between climate change, food security, and human health, and to identify vulnerabilities within the Canadian food system. Evidence suggests that key activities within the food system are vulnerable to climate change. The pathways in which climate change impacts travel through the food system and affect the critical dimensions of food security to influence human health outcomes are complex. Climate-related disruptions in the food system can indirectly impact human health by diminishing food security, which is a key determinant of health. Human health may also be directly affected by the physical effects of climate change on the food system, primarily related to the impacts on nutrition and foodborne illnesses. In this study, we propose a novel analytical framework to study and respond to the climate change, food security, and human health nexus. This work is intended to help public health officials, researchers, and relevant stakeholders investigate and understand current and future risks, and inform adaptation efforts to protect the health of Canadians.
302;Towards Improved Linkage of Disaster Risk Reduction and Climate Change Adaptation in Health: A Review;"Climate change and climate-sensitive disasters significantly impact health. Linking Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and Climate Change Adaptation (CCA) is essential for addressing these ever present, complex and increasing risks. Recent calls have been made to build these links in health. However, there is a need to clearly articulate why linking DRR and CCA is important in health. Furthermore, little is known about how DRR and CCA should be linked in health. By extensively examining relevant literature, this review presents the current state of knowledge of linking DRR and CCA in health. This includes the potential for maximising conceptual synergies such as building resilience, and reducing vulnerability and risk. Additionally, technical and operational synergies are identified to link DRR and CCA in health, including: policy, Early Warning Systems, vulnerability and risk assessment, health systems strengthening, infrastructure resilience, disaster preparedness and response, and health impact pathways. Public health actors have a central role in building these links due to their expertise, work functions, and experience in addressing complex health risks. The review concludes with recommendations for future research, including how to better link DRR and CCA in health; and the opportunities, challenges and enablers to build and sustain these links."
303;#Climate Change on TikTok: A Content Analysis of Videos;Current day youth have an important role in climate activism, as the decisions and policies made now will have long lasting impacts on the climate and sustainability. Climate change is becoming an increasing concern for younger generations. As such, the purpose of this study was to describe content related to climate change on TikTok. This study included 100 English-language videos related to climate change featured on TikTok. The hashtag #climatechange was chosen because it had the most views of any related hashtag at the time of the study. The number of views, comments, and likes were recorded for each video. Each video was also observed for the presence of predetermined content characteristics. The 100 videos sampled collectively received 205,551,200 views, 40, 203,400 likes, and 666,089 comments. Only eight of the 100 videos included information from a reputable source. Only three of the characteristics were featured in a majority (> 50) of the videos. These were, presents climate change as real (93), affected populations (76), and climate anxiety/frustration (57). Videos mentioning natural disasters garnered 63,453,100 (30.87%) views, 14,245,200 (35.43%) likes, and 236,493 (35.50%) comments. In all, 73 of the 100 videos mentioned at least one environmental impact. Videos including this theme earned 156,677,200 (76.22%) views, 32,000,700 (79.60%) likes, and 563,195 (84.55%) comments. Social media platforms such as TikTok are important tools for understanding popular opinion regarding public health issues such as global climate change. However, the presence of credible professionals is essential on platforms such as TikTok to increase the chances that messaging is as comprehensive as time allows, while also being scientifically sound.
304;Strategies for mitigation of climate change: a review;"Climate change is defined as the shift in climate patterns mainly caused by greenhouse gas emissions from natural systems and human activities. So far, anthropogenic activities have caused about 1.0 °C of global warming above the pre-industrial level and this is likely to reach 1.5 °C between 2030 and 2052 if the current emission rates persist. In 2018, the world encountered 315 cases of natural disasters which are mainly related to the climate. Approximately 68.5 million people were affected, and economic losses amounted to $131.7 billion, of which storms, floods, wildfires and droughts accounted for approximately 93%. Economic losses attributed to wildfires in 2018 alone are almost equal to the collective losses from wildfires incurred over the past decade, which is quite alarming. Furthermore, food, water, health, ecosystem, human habitat and infrastructure have been identified as the most vulnerable sectors under climate attack. In 2015, the Paris agreement was introduced with the main objective of limiting global temperature increase to 2 °C by 2100 and pursuing efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 °C. This article reviews the main strategies for climate change abatement, namely conventional mitigation, negative emissions and radiative forcing geoengineering. Conventional mitigation technologies focus on reducing fossil-based CO2 emissions. Negative emissions technologies are aiming to capture and sequester atmospheric carbon to reduce carbon dioxide levels. Finally, geoengineering techniques of radiative forcing alter the earth’s radiative energy budget to stabilize or reduce global temperatures. It is evident that conventional mitigation efforts alone are not sufficient to meet the targets stipulated by the Paris agreement; therefore, the utilization of alternative routes appears inevitable. While various technologies presented may still be at an early stage of development, biogenic-based sequestration techniques are to a certain extent mature and can be deployed immediately."
305;Climate Change and Human Health;Climate change impacts on human health span the trajectory of time—past, present, and future. The key finding from the Working Group II, Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) states that health impacts due to climate change have already occurred in the past, are currently occurring and will continue to occur, at least for the foreseeable future, even with immediate reductions in greenhouse gas emissions [1]. According to the IPCC, there has been increased heat-related mortality and decreased cold-related mortality in some regions as a result of warming (Box 1). Moreover, local changes in temperature and rainfall have altered the distribution of some water-borne illnesses and disease vectors. Impacts of climate-related extremes include alteration of ecosystems, disruption of food production and water supply, damage to infrastructure and settlements, morbidity and mortality, and consequences for mental health and human well-being [1].

306;Climate Change and Respiratory Health;Objective: To discuss the nature of climate change and both its immediate and long-term effects on human respiratory health. Methods: This review is based on information from a presentation of the American College of Chest Physicians course on Occupational and Environmental Lung Disease held in Toronto, Canada, June 2013. It is supplemented by a PubMed search for climate change, global warming, respiratory tract diseases, and respiratory health. It is also supplemented by a search of Web sites including the Environmental Protection Agency, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, World Meteorological Association, National Snow and Ice Data Center, Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change, and the World Health Organization. Results: Health effects of climate change include an increase in the prevalence of certain respiratory diseases, exacerbations of chronic lung disease, premature mortality, allergic responses, and declines in lung function. Conclusions: Climate change, mediated by greenhouse gases, causes adverse health effects to the most vulnerable patient populations—the elderly, children, and those in distressed socioeconomic strata.
307;Impacts of Climate Change on Health and Wellbeing in South Africa;"Given its associated burden of disease, climate change in South Africa could be reframed as predominately a health issue, one necessitating an urgent health-sector response. The growing impact of climate change has major implications for South Africa, especially for the numerous vulnerable groups in the country. We systematically reviewed the literature by searching PubMed and Web of Science. Of the 820 papers screened, 34 were identified that assessed the impacts of climate change on health in the country. Most papers covered effects of heat on health or on infectious diseases (20/34; 59%). We found that extreme weather events are the most noticeable effects to date, especially droughts in the Western Cape, but rises in vector-borne diseases are gaining prominence. Climate aberration is also linked in myriad ways with outbreaks of food and waterborne diseases, and possibly with the recent Listeria epidemic. The potential impacts of climate change on mental health may compound the multiple social stressors that already beset the populace. Climate change heightens the pre-existing vulnerabilities of women, fishing communities, rural subsistence farmers and those living in informal settlements. Further gender disparities, eco-migration and social disruptions may undermine the prevention—but also treatment—of HIV. Our findings suggest that focused research and effective use of surveillance data are required to monitor climate change’s impacts; traditional strengths of the country’s health sector. The health sector, hitherto a fringe player, should assume a greater leadership role in promoting policies that protect the public’s health, address inequities and advance the country’s commitments to climate change accords."
308;Stress Testing the Capacity of Health Systems to Manage Climate Change-Related Shocks and Stresses;"Vulnerability and adaptation assessments can provide valuable input to foster climate-resilient health systems. However, these assessments often do not explore the potential health risks of climate change far outside the range of recent experience with extreme weather events and other climate-related hazards. Climate and health stress tests are designed to increase the capacity of health systems and related sectors to manage potentially disruptive climate-related shocks and stresses. Stress tests focus on hypothetical scenarios, during which it would be difficult for the health system to maintain its essential function of providing services to protect population health. The stress test explores approaches to effectively manage acute and chronic climate-related events and conditions that could directly impact health systems, and climate-related events in non-health sectors that can indirectly impact health outcomes and/or health system function. We provide detailed methods and guidance for conducting climate and health stress tests, centering on three primary activities: (1) preparing and scoping the stress test; (2) successfully conducting the stress test; and (3) communicating the results to key stakeholders to facilitate policy and programmatic reforms."
309;Gender dimension of vulnerability to climate change and variability;PurposeThis paper aims to investigate farmers’ vulnerability to climate change and variability in the northern region of Ghana.Design/methodology/approachThe study assessed the vulnerability of male-headed and female-headed farming households to climate change and variability by using the livelihood vulnerability index (LVI) and tested for significant difference in their vulnerability levels by applying independent two-sample-student’st-test based on gender by using a sample of 210 smallholder farming households.FindingsThe results revealed a significant difference in the vulnerability levels of female-headed and male-headed farming households. Female–headed households were more vulnerable to livelihood strategies, socio-demographic profile, social networks, water and food major components of the LVI, whereas male-headed households were more vulnerable to health. The vulnerability indices revealed that female–headed households were more sensitive to the impact of climate change and variability. However, female-headed households have the least adaptive capacities. In all, female-headed farming households are more vulnerable to climate change and variability than male-headed farming households.Research limitations/implicationsThe study recommends that female-headed households should be given priority in both on-going and new intervention projects in climate change and agriculture by empowering them through financial resource support to venture into other income-generating activities. This would enable them to diversify their sources of livelihoods to boost their resilience to climate change and variability.Originality/valueThis is the first study that examined the gender dimension of vulnerability of smallholder farmers in Ghana by using the livelihood vulnerability framework. Female subordination in northern region of Ghana has been profound to warrant a study on gender dimension in relation to climate change and variability, especially as it is a semi-arid region with unpredictable climatic conditions. This research revealed the comparative vulnerability of male- and female-headed households to climate change and variability.
310;Health consequences of climate change in Bangladesh: An overview of the evidence, knowledge gaps and challenges;Climate change affects almost all aspects of human life, including health. This is particularly true in densely populated and low lying deltas such as Bangladesh. However, the climate‐health nexus is a relatively poorly explored domain of research, which is a cause for concern given the country's intrinsic vulnerability to climatic impacts. The impact of climate change on human health and well‐being can be manifested through different pathways and can be categorized as being direct or indirect, mediated through complex biophysical and social dynamics. The direct effects of climate change that have been observed in Bangladesh include morbidity and mortality due to heat stress, cyclones, floods, droughts and other weather extremes at different spatio‐temporal scales. The indirect effects adopt more complex routes which includes, threatening food and water security due to salinity intrusion, and spread of infectious diseases due to changes in vector and pathogen ecology. Social dynamics in Bangladesh, such as those related to gender roles, poverty and power relations, also influence how the effects of climate change are experienced by different segments of the society. The Government of Bangladesh has a number of measures already in place, efforts that have been complemented by local interventions. Evidence to take robust health policy decisions related to climate change is limited and scattered, while there is a lack of multidisciplinary research efforts. Considering these limitations, generating and summarizing scientific evidence is vital for informing a resilient health system against future public health concerns in climate vulnerable countries such as Bangladesh and in other low‐income regions.
311;Commonalities between Disaster and Climate Change Risks for Health: A Theoretical Framework;Disasters and climate change have significant implications for human health worldwide. Both climate change and the climate-sensitive hazards that result in disasters, are discussed in terms of direct and indirect impacts on health. A growing body of literature has argued for the need to link disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation. However, there is limited articulation of the commonalities between these health impacts. Understanding the shared risk pathways is an important starting point for developing joint strategies for adapting to, and reducing, health risks. Therefore, this article discusses the common aspects of direct and indirect health risks of climate change and climate-sensitive disasters. Based on this discussion a theoretical framework is presented for understanding these commonalities. As such, this article hopes to extend the current health impact frameworks and provide a platform for further research exploring opportunities for linked adaptation and risk reduction strategies.
312;Climate Change, Disinformation, and How to Combat It.;Climate change presents a challenge at multiple levels: It challenges our cognitive abilities because the effect of the accumulation of emissions is difficult to understand. Climate change also challenges many people's worldview because any climate mitigation regime will have economic and political implications that are incompatible with libertarian ideals of unregulated free markets. These political implications have created an environment of rhetorical adversity in which disinformation abounds, thus compounding the challenges for climate communicators. The existing literature on how to communicate climate change and dispel misinformation converges on several conclusions: First, providing information about climate change, in particular explanations of why it occurs, can enhance people's acceptance of science. Second, highlighting the scientific consensus can be an effective means to counter misinformation and raise public acceptance. Third, culturally aligned messages and messengers are more likely to be successful. Finally, climate misinformation is best defanged, through a process known as inoculation, before it is encountered, although debunking techniques can also be successful. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 42 is April 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.
313;Impact of extreme weather events and climate change for health and social care systems;This review, commissioned by the Research Councils UK Living With Environmental Change (LWEC) programme, concerns research on the impacts on health and social care systems in the United Kingdom of extreme weather events, under conditions of climate change. Extreme weather events considered include heatwaves, coldwaves and flooding. Using a structured review method, we consider evidence regarding the currently observed and anticipated future impacts of extreme weather on health and social care systems and the potential of preparedness and adaptation measures that may enhance resilience. We highlight a number of general conclusions which are likely to be of international relevance, although the review focussed on the situation in the UK. Extreme weather events impact the operation of health services through the effects on built, social and institutional infrastructures which support health and health care, and also because of changes in service demand as extreme weather impacts on human health. Strategic planning for extreme weather and impacts on the care system should be sensitive to within country variations. Adaptation will require changes to built infrastructure systems (including transport and utilities as well as individual care facilities) and also to institutional and social infrastructure supporting the health care system. Care sector organisations, communities and individuals need to adapt their practices to improve resilience of health and health care to extreme weather. Preparedness and emergency response strategies call for action extending beyond the emergency response services, to include health and social care providers more generally.
314;The impact of climate change and natural disasters on vulnerable populations: A systematic review of literature;ABSTRACT Climate change is acknowledged as being a crucial determinant of public health. The United States is experiencing an increase in the frequency and intensity of natural disasters as a result of climate change activity, influencing the ways federal, state, and local governments are addressing the growing issue. Individuals who are vulnerable to the effects of extreme weather, namely the poor, the elderly/disabled, children, prisoners, and substance abusers have experienced heightened levels of mental, emotional, and bodily stress due to natural disaster exposure. Researchers from a variety of disciplines, public health, social science, and environmental studies, in particular, are examining how natural disasters are impacting mental and physical health functioning while noting the demographic factors leaving certain groups more susceptible to harm. A systematic literature review was conducted on the past 12 years of research that examined natural disaster-related experiences and psychological and physiological health outcomes on populations who are more vulnerable to adverse weather impacts. It was found that the mental and physical health of marginalized populations during and after a natural disaster were elevated and/or exacerbated by circumstances pertaining to the weather event and the lack of disaster-response actions. It was also found that fostering social capital is a way to combat stressors in disadvantaged communities. It is imperative that clinicians and policy makers confront the issue of climate change and natural disasters, developing relief efforts and preventative measures to secure the well-being of underserved groups who may not have many resources at their disposal.
315;Biodiversity, Physical Health and Climate Change: A Synthesis of Recent Evidence;We are at a point in history marked by unprecedented changes in the environmental foundations of human health and well-being. At the same time, the demands from human populations have never been greater, with profound differences in how we engage with the natural environment. By the middle of this century, when climate change impacts are further increasing, the United Nations expects the global population to be approaching 10 billion. In this chapter, we provide a synthesis of published evidence of the complex and important relationships between elements of biodiversity, health and climate change. We draw primarily on reviews conducted in the past five years supplemented with evidence on additional themes. We also develop a detailed case study example focused on urban climate, climate change and biodiversity, taken from the perspective of a large and representative conurbation. The case study uses a body of existing published evidence together with new data and insights to demonstrate important pathways, impacts and outcomes. We end by identifying a set of research questions and stress the need for even more extensive multi-disciplinary and multi-sector approaches. Nevertheless, despite the need for more knowledge, it is already clear that more effective action could, and should, be taken.
316;Projecting heat-related excess mortality under climate change scenarios in China;Recent studies have reported a variety of health consequences of climate change. However, the vulnerability of individuals and cities to climate change remains to be evaluated. We project the excess cause-, age-, region-, and education-specific mortality attributable to future high temperatures in 161 Chinese districts/counties using 28 global climate models (GCMs) under two representative concentration pathways (RCPs). To assess the influence of population ageing on the projection of future heat-related mortality, we further project the age-specific effect estimates under five shared socioeconomic pathways (SSPs). Heat-related excess mortality is projected to increase from 1.9% (95% eCI: 0.2–3.3%) in the 2010s to 2.4% (0.4–4.1%) in the 2030 s and 5.5% (0.5–9.9%) in the 2090 s under RCP8.5, with corresponding relative changes of 0.5% (0.0–1.2%) and 3.6% (−0.5–7.5%). The projected slopes are steeper in southern, eastern, central and northern China. People with cardiorespiratory diseases, females, the elderly and those with low educational attainment could be more affected. Population ageing amplifies future heat-related excess deaths 2.3- to 5.8-fold under different SSPs, particularly for the northeast region. Our findings can help guide public health responses to ameliorate the risk of climate change. Global warming is expected to increase mortality due to heat stress in many regions. Here, the authors asses how mortality due to high temperatures changes in China changes for different demographic groups and show that heat-related excess mortality is increasing under climate change, a process that is strongly amplified by population ageing.
317;Anthropogenic climate change is worsening North American pollen seasons;Significance Human-caused climate change could impact respiratory health, including asthma and allergies, through temperature-driven increases in airborne pollen, but the long-term continental pollen trends and role of climate change in pollen patterns are not well-understood. We measure pollen trends across North America from 1990 to 2018 and find increases in pollen concentrations and longer pollen seasons. We use an ensemble of climate models to test the role of climate change and find that it is the dominant driver of changes in pollen season length and a significant contributor to increasing pollen concentrations. Our results indicate that human-caused climate change has already worsened North American pollen seasons, and climate-driven pollen trends are likely to further exacerbate respiratory health impacts in coming decades. Airborne pollen has major respiratory health impacts and anthropogenic climate change may increase pollen concentrations and extend pollen seasons. While greenhouse and field studies indicate that pollen concentrations are correlated with temperature, a formal detection and attribution of the role of anthropogenic climate change in continental pollen seasons is urgently needed. Here, we use long-term pollen data from 60 North American stations from 1990 to 2018, spanning 821 site-years of data, and Earth system model simulations to quantify the role of human-caused climate change in continental patterns in pollen concentrations. We find widespread advances and lengthening of pollen seasons (+20 d) and increases in pollen concentrations (+21%) across North America, which are strongly coupled to observed warming. Human forcing of the climate system contributed ∼50% (interquartile range: 19–84%) of the trend in pollen seasons and ∼8% (4–14%) of the trend in pollen concentrations. Our results reveal that anthropogenic climate change has already exacerbated pollen seasons in the past three decades with attendant deleterious effects on respiratory health.
318;At-a-glance - Climate change impacts on health and wellbeing in rural and remote regions across Canada: a synthesis of the literature.;This article provides a synthesis of the forthcoming first order draft of the Canadian Government's National Assessment on Climate Change 'Rural and Remote' chapter, highlighting key health concerns from the literature associated with climate change in rural and remote regions, as well as existing and future adaptation strategies. To support the health and wellbeing of those experiencing the negative effects of climate change, and utilizing systematic search processes, this synthesis article highlights the importance of considering the specific socio-cultural, economic, and geographic elements and existing expertise of individuals and communities in rural and remote regions.
319;Impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security: a global perspective—a review article;Climate change is happening due to natural factors and human activities. It expressively alters biodiversity, agricultural production, and food security. Mainly, narrowly adapted and endemic species are under extinction. Accordingly, concerns over species extinction are warranted as it provides food for all life forms and primary health care for more than 60–80% of humans globally. Nevertheless, the impact of climate change on biodiversity and food security has been recognized, little is explored compared to the magnitude of the problem globally. Therefore, the objectives of this review are to identify, appraise, and synthesize the link between climate change, biodiversity, and food security. Data, climatic models, emission, migration, and extinction scenarios, and outputs from previous publications were used. Due to climate change, distributions of species have shifted to higher elevations at a median rate of 11.0 m and 16.9 km per decade to higher latitudes. Accordingly, extinction rates of 1103 species under migration scenarios, provide 21–23% with unlimited migration and 38–52% with no migration. When an environmental variation occurs on a timescale shorter than the life of the plant any response could be in terms of a plastic phenotype. However, phenotypic plasticity could buffer species against the long-term effects of climate change. Furthermore, climate change affects food security particularly in communities and locations that depend on rain-fed agriculture. Crops and plants have thresholds beyond which growth and yield are compromised. Accordingly, agricultural yields in Africa alone could be decline by more than 30% in 2050. Therefore, solving food shortages through bringing extra land into agriculture and exploiting new fish stocks is a costly solution, when protecting biodiversity is given priority. Therefore, mitigating food waste, compensating food-insecure people conserving biodiversity, effective use of genetic resources, and traditional ecological knowledge could decrease further biodiversity loss, and meet food security under climate change scenarios. However, achieving food security under such scenario requires strong policies, releasing high-yielding stress resistant varieties, developing climate resilient irrigation structures, and agriculture. Therefore, degraded land restoration, land use changes, use of bio-energy, sustainable forest management, and community based biodiversity conservation are recommended to mitigate climate change impacts.
320;The Political Economy of Health Co-Benefits: Embedding Health in the Climate Change Agenda;A complex, whole-of-economy issue such as climate change demands an interdisciplinary, multi-sectoral response. However, evidence suggests that human health has remained elusive in its influence on the development of ambitious climate change mitigation policies for many national governments, despite a recognition that the combustion of fossil fuels results in pervasive short- and long-term health consequences. We use insights from literature on the political economy of health and climate change, the science–policy interface and power in policy-making, to identify additional barriers to the meaningful incorporation of health co-benefits into climate change mitigation policy development. Specifically, we identify four key interrelated areas where barriers may exist in relation to health co-benefits: discourse, efficiency, vested interests and structural challenges. With these insights in mind, we argue that the current politico-economic paradigm in which climate change is situated and the processes used to develop climate change mitigation policies do not adequately support accounting for health co-benefits. We present approaches for enhancing the role of health co-benefits in the development of climate change mitigation policies to ensure that health is embedded in the broader climate change agenda.
321;Heat, Human Performance, and Occupational Health: A Key Issue for the Assessment of Global Climate Change Impacts.;Ambient heat exposure is a well-known health hazard, which reduces human performance and work capacity at heat levels already common in tropical and subtropical areas. Various health problems have been reported. Increasing heat exposure during the hottest seasons of each year is a key feature of global climate change. Heat exhaustion and reduced human performance are often overlooked in climate change health impact analysis. Later this century, many among the four billion people who live in hot areas worldwide will experience significantly reduced work capacity owing to climate change. In some areas, 30-40% of annual daylight hours will become too hot for work to be carried out. The social and economic impacts will be considerable, with global gross domestic product (GDP) losses greater than 20% by 2100. The analysis to date is piecemeal. More analysis of climate change-related occupational health impact assessments is greatly needed.
322;Globalization, climate change, and human health.;Climate change affects the range of pathogens and temperatures to which populations are exposed. This article reviews the nature of these changes and explores how efforts to mitigate climate change could be of value to the global community.
323;Core Competencies for Health Workers to Deal with Climate and Environmental Change;Rapid, detrimental climate change and environmental degradation pose real threats to the health, environment, social, economic and technological wellbeing of society (HESET). It has become even more imperative that the health workforce (public health and medical healthcare as well as auxiliary and support workers) be ‘climate-environment’ competent to fulfil their role in managing the environmental public health risks and impacts as climate and environment inevitably continue to change. We developed a broad six-domain competency framework consisting of (1) climate and environment sciences, (2) drivers of climate change (3) evidence, projections and assessments (4) iterative risk management (5) mitigation, adaptation and health co-benefits and (6) collective strategies—harnessing international/regional/local agreements and frameworks. The framework can be used by health/medical trainers to design cross-sectoral sub-competencies and learning content for training health workers to function at local, regional and global levels. Reaching, maintaining and improving the different levels of competency, the health workforce will be increasingly invaluable partners in intra- as well as inter-sectoral responses to climate and environmental risks and impacts.
324;Climate Change, Climate Justice, and Environmental Health: Implications for the Nursing Profession.;PURPOSE Climate change is an emerging challenge linked to negative outcomes for the environment and human health. Since the 1960s, there has been a growing recognition of the need to address climate change and the impact of greenhouse gas emissions implicated in the warming of our planet. There are also deleterious health outcomes linked to complex climate changes that are emerging in the 21st century. This article addresses the social justice issues associated with climate change and human health and discussion of climate justice.   ORGANIZING CONSTRUCT Discussion paper.   METHODS A literature search of electronic databases was conducted for articles, texts, and documents related to climate change, climate justice, and human health.   FINDINGS The literature suggests that those who contribute least to global warming are those who will disproportionately be affected by the negative health outcomes of climate change. The concept of climate justice and the role of the Mary Robinson Foundation-Climate Justice are discussed within a framework of nursing's professional responsibility and the importance of social justice for the world's people. The nursing profession must take a leadership role in engaging in policy and advocacy discussions in addressing the looming problems associated with climate change.   CONCLUSIONS Nursing organizations have adopted resolutions and engaged in leadership roles to address climate change at the local, regional, national, and global level. It is essential that nurses embrace concepts related to social justice and engage in the policy debate regarding the deleterious effects on human health related to global warming and climate change. Nursing's commitment to social justice offers an opportunity to offer significant global leadership in addressing the health implications related to climate change.   CLINICAL RELEVANCE Recognizing the negative impacts of climate change on well-being and the underlying socioeconomic reasons for their disproportionate and inequitable distribution can expand and optimize the profession's role in education, practice, research, and policy-making efforts to address climate change.
325;A review of renewable energy sources, sustainability issues and climate change mitigation;Abstract The world is fast becoming a global village due to the increasing daily requirement of energy by all population across the world while the earth in its form cannot change. The need for energy and its related services to satisfy human social and economic development, welfare and health is increasing. Returning to renewables to help mitigate climate change is an excellent approach which needs to be sustainable in order to meet energy demand of future generations. The study reviewed the opportunities associated with renewable energy sources which includes: Energy Security, Energy Access, Social and Economic development, Climate Change Mitigation, and reduction of environmental and health impacts. Despite these opportunities, there are challenges that hinder the sustainability of renewable energy sources towards climate change mitigation. These challenges include Market failures, lack of information, access to raw materials for future renewable resource deployment, and our daily carbon footprint. The study suggested some measures and policy recommendations which when considered would help achieve the goal of renewable energy thus to reduce emissions, mitigate climate change and provide a clean environment as well as clean energy for all and future generations.
326;Climate Change, Food Supply, and Dietary Guidelines.;"Food production is affected by climate change, and, in turn, food production is responsible for 20-30% of greenhouse gases. The food system must increase output as the population increases and must meet nutrition and health needs while simultaneously assisting in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals. Good nutrition is important for combatting infection, reducing child mortality, and controlling obesity and chronic disease throughout the life course. Dietary guidelines provide advice for a healthy diet, and the main principles are now well established and compatible with sustainable development. Climate change will have a significant effect on food supply; however, with political commitment and substantial investment, projected improvements will be sufficient to provide food for the healthy diets needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. Some changes will need to be made to food production, nutrient content will need monitoring, and more equitable distribution is required to meet the dietary guidelines. Increased breastfeeding rates will improve infant and adult health while helping to greenhouse gases. Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Public Health, Volume 42 is April 2021. Please see http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates."
327;The impact of climate change on neglected tropical diseases: a systematic review;Abstract Neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) are a diverse group of diseases that continue to affect >1 billion people, with these diseases disproportionately impacting vulnerable populations and territories. Climate change is having an increasing impact on public health in tropical and subtropical areas and across the world and can affect disease distribution and transmission in potentially diverse ways. Improving our understanding of how climate change influences NTDs can help identify populations at risk to include in future public health interventions. Articles were identified by searching electronic databases for reports of climate change and NTDs between 1 January 2010 and 1 March 2020. Climate change may influence the emergence and re-emergence of multiple NTDs, particularly those that involve a vector or intermediate host for transmission. Although specific predictions are conflicting depending on the geographic area, the type of NTD and associated vectors and hosts, it is anticipated that multiple NTDs will have changes in their transmission period and geographic range and will likely encroach on regions and populations that have been previously unaffected. There is a need for improved surveillance and monitoring to identify areas of NTD incursion and emergence and include these in future public health interventions.
328;Climate Change, Weather, Housing Precarity, and Homelessness: A Systematic Review of Reviews;This systematic review of reviews was conducted to examine housing precarity and homelessness in relation to climate change and weather extremes internationally. In a thematic analysis of 15 reviews (5 systematic and 10 non-systematic), the following themes emerged: risk factors for homelessness/housing precarity, temperature extremes, health concerns, structural factors, natural disasters, and housing. First, an increased risk of homelessness has been found for people who are vulnerably housed and populations in lower socio-economic positions due to energy insecurity and climate change-induced natural hazards. Second, homeless/vulnerably-housed populations are disproportionately exposed to climatic events (temperature extremes and natural disasters). Third, the physical and mental health of homeless/vulnerably-housed populations is projected to be impacted by weather extremes and climate change. Fourth, while green infrastructure may have positive effects for homeless/vulnerably-housed populations, housing remains a major concern in urban environments. Finally, structural changes must be implemented. Recommendations for addressing the impact of climate change on homelessness and housing precarity were generated, including interventions focusing on homelessness/housing precarity and reducing the effects of weather extremes, improved housing and urban planning, and further research on homelessness/housing precarity and climate change. To further enhance the impact of these initiatives, we suggest employing the Human Rights-Based Approach (HRBA).
329;Public health and climate change: How are local authorities preparing for the health impacts of our changing climate?;ABSTRACT Background Local authorities have a crucial role in preparing for the impacts of climate change. However, the extent to which health impacts are being prioritized and acted on is not well understood. Methods We investigated the role of public health in adapting to climate change through: (i) a content analysis of local authority climate change adaptation strategies in South West England and (ii) semi-structured telephone interviews with local authority public health consultants and sustainability officers and a regional Public Health England representative (n = 11). Results Adaptation strategies/plans varied in existence and scope. Public health consultants did not have an explicit remit for climate change adaptation, although related action often aligned with public health’s emergency planning functions. Key barriers to health-related adaptation were financial constraints, lack of leadership and limited public and professional awareness about health impacts. Conclusions Local authorities in South West England have differing approaches to tackling health impacts of climate change, and the prominence of public health arguments for adaptation varies. Improved public health intelligence, concise communications, targeted support, visible local and national leadership and clarity on economic costs and benefits of adaptation would be useful for local authorities in preparing for the health impacts of climate change.
330;Observed and Projected Impacts of Climate Change on Marine Fisheries, Aquaculture, Coastal Tourism, and Human Health: An Update;The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) states that climate change and ocean acidification are altering the oceans at a rate that is unprecedented compared with the recent past, leading to multifaceted impacts on marine ecosystems, associated goods and services, and human societies. AR5 underlined key uncertainties that remain regarding how synergistic changes in the ocean are likely to affect human systems, and how humans are likely to respond to these events. As climate change research has accelerated rapidly following AR5, an updated synthesis of available knowledge is necessary to identify emerging evidence, and to thereby better inform policy discussions. This paper reviews the literature to capture corroborating, conflicting, and novel findings published following the cut-off date for contribution to AR5. Specifically, we highlight key scientific developments on the impacts of climate-induced changes in the ocean on key socioeconomic sectors, including fisheries, aquaculture and tourism. New evidence continues to support a climate-induced redistribution of benefits and losses at multiple scales and across coastal and marine socio-ecological systems, partly resulting from species and ecosystem range shifts and changes in primary productivity. New efforts have been made to characterize and value ecosystem services in the context of climate change, with specific relevance to ecosystem-based adaptation. Recent studies have also explored synergistic interactions between climatic drivers, and have found strong variability between impacts on species at different life stages. Although climate change may improve conditions for some types of freshwater aquaculture, potentially providing alternative opportunities to adapt to impacts on wild capture fisheries, ocean acidification poses a risk to shellfish fisheries and aquaculture. The risk of increased prevalence of disease under warmer temperatures is uncertain, and may detrimentally affect human health. Climate change may also induce changes in tourism flows, leading to substantial geospatial shifts in economic costs and benefits associated with tourism revenue and coastal infrastructure protection and repairs. While promising, ecosystem-based coastal adaptation approaches are still emerging, and require an improved understanding of key ecosystem services and values for coastal communities in order to assess risk, aid coastal development planning, and build decision support systems.
331;Heat Exposure and Maternal Health in the Face of Climate Change;Climate change will increasingly affect the health of vulnerable populations, including maternal and fetal health. This systematic review aims to identify recent literature that investigates increasing heat and extreme temperatures on pregnancy outcomes globally. We identify common research findings in order to create a comprehensive understanding of how immediate effects will be sustained in the next generation. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guide, we systematically reviewed articles from PubMed and Cochrane Reviews. We included articles that identify climate change-related exposures and adverse health effects for pregnant women. There is evidence that temperature extremes adversely impact birth outcomes, including, but not limited to: changes in length of gestation, birth weight, stillbirth, and neonatal stress in unusually hot temperature exposures. The studies included in this review indicate that not only is there a need for further research on the ways that climate change, and heat in particular, may affect maternal health and neonatal outcomes, but that uniform standards for assessing the effects of heat on maternal fetal health also need to be established.
332;Energy insecurity: a framework for understanding energy, the built environment, and health among vulnerable populations in the context of climate change.;The author reflects on climate change and on the impact that climate change has on the built environment and public health. She suggests that the effects of climate change are experienced in the built environments which surround most individuals. She argues that as the effects of climate change become more apparent greater attention and approaches to increase awareness and reduce climate change are necessary to protect public health.
333;Health Impact of Climate Change in Older People: An Integrative Review and Implications for Nursing;PURPOSE Older people account for the highest proportion of mortality from extreme weather events associated with climate change. This article aims to describe the health impacts of climate change on older people.   TYPE OF STUDY An integrative review was conducted with 30 studies retrieved from PubMed, EBSCO, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) on climate stressors, determinants of resilient capacity, risk factors, and health outcomes.   FINDINGS Heat, temperature variability, and air pollution increase mortality risk in older people, especially from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Floods are linked with increasing incidence of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety. Facing these adversities, older people exhibit both vulnerability and resilience.   CONCLUSIONS Research gaps exist in understanding the full spectrum of the resilience experience of older people, and appreciating areas wherein nursing can play a pivotal role.   CLINICAL RELEVANCE Recognizing the vulnerabilities of older people in the context of climate change is important. Identifying opportunities to promote resilience is an important focus for nurses to develop tailored and targeted nursing interventions.
334;Climate Change and Eutrophication: A Short Review;Water resources are vital not only for human beings but essentially all ecosystems. Human health is at risk if clean drinking water becomes contaminated. Water is also essential for agriculture, manufacturing, energy production and other diverse uses. Therefore, a changing climate and its potential effects put more pressure on water resources. Climate change may cause increased water demand as a result of rising temperatures and evaporation while decreasing water availability. On the other hand, extreme events as a result of climate change can increase surface runoff and flooding, deteriorating water quality as well. One effect is water eutrophication, which occurs when high concentrations of nutrients, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are present in the water. Nutrients come from different sources including agriculture, wastewater, stormwater, and fossil fuel combustion. Algal blooms can cause many problems, such as deoxygenation and water toxicity, ultimately disrupting normal ecosystem functioning. In this paper, we investigate the potential impacts of climatic factors affecting water eutrophication, how these factors are projected to change in the future, and what their projected potential impacts will be.
335;Detecting and Attributing Health Burdens to Climate Change;Background: Detection and attribution of health impacts caused by climate change uses formal methods to determine a) whether the occurrence of adverse health outcomes has changed, and b) the extent to which that change could be attributed to climate change. There have been limited efforts to undertake detection and attribution analyses in health. Objective: Our goal was to show a range of approaches for conducting detection and attribution analyses. Results: Case studies for heatwaves, Lyme disease in Canada, and Vibrio emergence in northern Europe highlight evidence that climate change is adversely affecting human health. Changes in rates and geographic distribution of adverse health outcomes were detected, and, in each instance, a proportion of the observed changes could, in our judgment, be attributed to changes in weather patterns associated with climate change. Conclusions: The results of detection and attribution studies can inform evidence-based risk management to reduce current, and plan for future, changes in health risks associated with climate change. Gaining a better understanding of the size, timing, and distribution of the climate change burden of disease and injury requires reliable long-term data sets, more knowledge about the factors that confound and modify the effects of climate on health, and refinement of analytic techniques for detection and attribution. At the same time, significant advances are possible in the absence of complete data and statistical certainty: there is a place for well-informed judgments, based on understanding of underlying processes and matching of patterns of health, climate, and other determinants of human well-being. https://doi.org/10.1289/EHP1509
336;Scientific review of the impact of climate change on plant pests;Climate change represents an unprecedented challenge to the world?s biosphere and to the global community. It also represents a unique challenge for plant health. Human activities and increased market globalization, coupled with rising temperatures, has led to a situation that is favourable to pest movement and establishment. This scientific review assesses the potential effects of climate change on plant pests and consequently on plant health. The evidence assessed strongly indicates that climate change has already expanded some pests? host range and geographical distribution, and may further increase the risk of pest introduction to new areas. This calls for international cooperation and development of harmonized plant protection strategies to help countries successfully adapt their pest risk management measures to climate change.
337;The need for clean air: The way air pollution and climate change affect allergic rhinitis and asthma;Air pollution and climate change have a significant impact on human health and well‐being and contribute to the onset and aggravation of allergic rhinitis and asthma among other chronic respiratory diseases. In Westernized countries, households have experienced a process of increasing insulation and individuals tend to spend most of their time indoors. These sequelae implicate a high exposure to indoor allergens (house dust mites, pets, molds, etc), tobacco smoke, and other pollutants, which have an impact on respiratory health. Outdoor air pollution derived from traffic and other human activities not only has a direct negative effect on human health but also enhances the allergenicity of some plants and contributes to global warming. Climate change modifies the availability and distribution of plant‐ and fungal‐derived allergens and increases the frequency of extreme climate events. This review summarizes the effects of indoor air pollution, outdoor air pollution, and subsequent climate change on asthma and allergic rhinitis in children and adults and addresses the policy adjustments and lifestyle changes required to mitigate their deleterious effects.
338;Climate change impacts on human health over Europe through its effect on air quality;This review examines the current literature on the effects of future emissions and climate change on particulate matter (PM) and O3 air quality and on the consequent health impacts, with a focus on Europe. There is considerable literature on the effects of climate change on O3 but fewer studies on the effects of climate change on PM concentrations. Under the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 5th assessment report (AR5) Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs), background O3 entering Europe is expected to decrease under most scenarios due to higher water vapour concentrations in a warmer climate. However, under the extreme pathway RCP8.5 higher (more than double) methane (CH4) abundances lead to increases in background O3 that offset the O3 decrease due to climate change especially for the 2100 period. Regionally, in polluted areas with high levels of nitrogen oxides (NOx), elevated surface temperatures and humidities yield increases in surface O3 – termed the O3 climate penalty – especially in southern Europe. The O3 response is larger for metrics that represent the higher end of the O3 distribution, such as daily maximum O3. Future changes in PM concentrations due to climate change are much less certain, although several recent studies also suggest a PM climate penalty due to high temperatures and humidity and reduced precipitation in northern mid-latitude land regions in 2100.A larger number of studies have examined both future climate and emissions changes under the RCP scenarios. Under these pathways the impact of emission changes on air quality out to the 2050s will be larger than that due to climate change, because of large reductions in emissions of O3 and PM pollutant precursor emissions and the more limited climate change response itself. Climate change will also affect climate extreme events such as heatwaves. Air pollution episodes are associated with stagnation events and sometimes heat waves. Air quality during the 2003 heatwave over Europe has been examined in numerous studies and mechanisms for enhancing O3 have been identified.There are few studies on health effects associated with climate change impacts alone on air quality, but these report higher O3-related health burdens in polluted populated regions and greater PM2.5 health burdens in these emission regions. Studies that examine the combined impacts of climate change and anthropogenic emissions change under the RCP scenarios report reductions in global and European premature O3-respiratory related and PM mortalities arising from the large decreases in precursor emissions. Under RCP 8.5 the large increase in CH4 leads to global and European excess O3-respiratory related mortalities in 2100. For future health effects, besides uncertainty in future O3 and particularly PM concentrations, there is also uncertainty in risk estimates such as effect modification by temperature on pollutant-response relationships and potential future adaptation that would alter exposure risk.
339;Understanding human influence on climate change in China;Abstract China's climate has been warming since the 1950s, with surface air temperature increasing at a rate higher than the global average. Changes in climate have exerted substantial impacts on water resources, agriculture, ecosystems and human health. Attributing past changes to causes provides a scientific foundation for national and international climate policies. Here, we review recent progress in attributing the observed climate changes over past decades in China. Anthropogenic forcings, dominated by greenhouse gas emissions, are the main drivers for observed increases in mean and extreme temperatures. Evidence of the effect of anthropogenic forcings on precipitation is emerging. Human influence has increased the probability of extreme heat events, and has likely changed the occurrence probabilities for some heavy precipitation events. The way a specific attribution question is posed and the conditions under which the question is addressed present persistent challenges for appropriately communicating attribution results to non-specialists.
340;Media Exposure to Climate Change, Anxiety, and Efficacy Beliefs in a Sample of Italian University Students;The climate crisis poses a serious threat to the health and well-being of individuals. For many, climate change knowledge is derived from indirect exposure to information transmitted through the media. Such content can elicit a variety of emotional responses, including anger, sadness, despair, fear, and guilt. Worry and anxiety are especially common responses, usually referred to as “climate anxiety”. The main objectives of this study were to analyze how exposure to climate change through the media relates to climate anxiety and individual and collective self-efficacy, and to evaluate the relationship between climate anxiety and efficacy beliefs. A total of 312 Italian university students (aged 18–26 years) participated in the research by filling out an anonymous questionnaire. Participants reported being exposed several times per week to information about climate change, especially from social media, newspapers, and television programs. Moreover, the results showed that the attention paid to information about climate change was not only positively related to climate anxiety, but also to individual and collective self-efficacy. Most notably, participants’ efficacy beliefs were found to be positively related to climate anxiety. This somewhat controversial finding stresses that, in the context of pro-environmental behavior changes, a moderate level of anxiety could engender feelings of virtue, encouraging people to rethink actions with negative ecological impacts.
341;Multiple Threats to Child Health from Fossil Fuel Combustion: Impacts of Air Pollution and Climate Change;"Background: Approaches to estimating and addressing the risk to children from fossil fuel combustion have been fragmented, tending to focus either on the toxic air emissions or on climate change. Yet developing children, and especially poor children, now bear a disproportionate burden of disease from both environmental pollution and climate change due to fossil fuel combustion. Objective: This commentary summarizes the robust scientific evidence regarding the multiple current and projected health impacts of fossil fuel combustion on the young to make the case for a holistic, child-centered energy and climate policy that addresses the full array of physical and psychosocial stressors resulting from fossil fuel pollution. Discussion: The data summarized here show that by sharply reducing our dependence on fossil fuels we would achieve highly significant health and economic benefits for our children and their future. These benefits would occur immediately and also play out over the life course and potentially across generations. Conclusion: Going beyond the powerful scientific and economic arguments for urgent action to reduce the burning of fossil fuels is the strong moral imperative to protect our most vulnerable populations.

342;Assessment of Risk, Vulnerability and Adaptation to Climate Change by the Health Sector in Madagascar;"Madagascar is cited as one of the most vulnerable countries to the effects of climate change, with significant impacts to the health of its population. In this study, the vulnerability of Madagascar’s health sector to climate change was assessed and appropriate adaptation measures were identified. In order to assess climate risks, vulnerability and identify adaptation options, the Madagascar Ministry of Public Health as well as the National Meteorological and Hydrological Service worked in close collaboration with a team of local experts to conduct a literature review, field surveys, and analyses of current and future climate and health trends. Four climate-sensitive diseases of primary concern are described in the study: acute respiratory infections (ARI), diarrhea, malnutrition, and malaria. Baseline conditions of these four diseases from 2000 to 2014 show acute respiratory infections and diarrheal diseases are increasing in incidence; while incidence of malnutrition and malaria decreased over this period. To assess future impacts in Madagascar, this baseline information was used with climate projections for the two scenarios—RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5—for the periods 2016–2035, 2036–2070 and 2071–2100. Future climate conditions are shown to exacerbate and increase the incidence of all four climate sensitive diseases. Further analysis of the exposure, sensitivity and adaptive capacity to the climate hazards suggests that the health sector in four regions of Madagascar is particularly vulnerable. The study recommends adaptation measures to improve the monitoring and early warning systems for climate sensitive diseases, as well as to reduce population vulnerability."
343;Forest health in a changing world: Effects of globalization and climate change on forest insect and pathogen impacts;Forests and trees throughout the world are increasingly affected by factors related to global change. Expanding international trade has facilitated invasions of numerous insects and pathogens into new regions. Many of these invasions have caused substantial forest damage, economic impacts and losses of ecosystem goods and services provided by trees. Climate change is already affecting the geographic distribution of host trees and their associated insects and pathogens, with anticipated increases in pest impacts by both native and invasive pests. Although climate change will benefit many forest insects, changes in thermal conditions may disrupt evolved life history traits and cause phenological mismatches. Individually, the threats posed to forest ecosystems by invasive pests and climate change are serious. Although interactions between these two drivers and their outcomes are poorly understood and hence difficult to predict, it is clear that the cumulative impacts on forest ecosystems will be exacerbated. Herewe introduce and synthesize the information in this special issue of Forestry with articles that illustrate the impacts of invasions of insects and pathogens, climate change, forest management and their interactions, as well as methods to predict, assess and mitigate these impacts. Most of these contributions were presented at the XXIV IUFROWorld Congress in 2014.
344;Climate Change and the Emergent Epidemic of CKD from Heat Stress in Rural Communities: The Case for Heat Stress Nephropathy.;Climate change has led to significant rise of 0.8°C-0.9°C in global mean temperature over the last century and has been linked with significant increases in the frequency and severity of heat waves (extreme heat events). Climate change has also been increasingly connected to detrimental human health. One of the consequences of climate-related extreme heat exposure is dehydration and volume loss, leading to acute mortality from exacerbations of pre-existing chronic disease, as well as from outright heat exhaustion and heat stroke. Recent studies have also shown that recurrent heat exposure with physical exertion and inadequate hydration can lead to CKD that is distinct from that caused by diabetes, hypertension, or GN. Epidemics of CKD consistent with heat stress nephropathy are now occurring across the world. Here, we describe this disease, discuss the locations where it appears to be manifesting, link it with increasing temperatures, and discuss ongoing attempts to prevent the disease. Heat stress nephropathy may represent one of the first epidemics due to global warming. Government, industry, and health policy makers in the impacted regions should place greater emphasis on occupational and community interventions.
345;Training Clinical And Public Health Leaders In Climate And Health.;The effects of climate change are accelerating and undermining human health and well-being in many different ways. There is no doubt that the health care sector will need to adapt, and although it has begun to develop more targeted strategies to address climate-related challenges, a broad knowledge gap persists. There is a critical need to develop and cultivate new knowledge and skill sets among health professionals, including those in public health, environmental science, policy, and communication roles. This article describes specific initiatives to train future leaders to be proficient in understanding the linkages between climate change and health. We present an agenda for expanding education on climate and health through health professional schools and graduate and postgraduate curricula, as well as in professional and continuing education settings. Our agenda also identifies ways to promote sustainability in clinical practice and health care management and policy. Throughout, we cite metrics by which to measure progress and highlight potential barriers to achieving these educational objectives on a larger scale.
346;Health Impacts of Climate Change in Pacific Island Countries: A Regional Assessment of Vulnerabilities and Adaptation Priorities;"Background: Between 2010 and 2012, the World Health Organization Division of Pacific Technical Support led a regional climate change and health vulnerability assessment and adaptation planning project, in collaboration with health sector partners, in 13 Pacific island countries—Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. Objective: We assessed the vulnerabilities of Pacific island countries to the health impacts of climate change and planned adaptation strategies to minimize such threats to health. Methods: This assessment involved a combination of quantitative and qualitative techniques. The former included descriptive epidemiology, time series analyses, Poisson regression, and spatial modeling of climate and climate-sensitive disease data, in the few instances where this was possible; the latter included wide stakeholder consultations, iterative consensus building, and expert opinion. Vulnerabilities were ranked using a “likelihood versus impact” matrix, and adaptation strategies were prioritized and planned accordingly. Results: The highest-priority climate-sensitive health risks in Pacific island countries included trauma from extreme weather events, heat-related illnesses, compromised safety and security of water and food, vector-borne diseases, zoonoses, respiratory illnesses, psychosocial ill-health, non-communicable diseases, population pressures, and health system deficiencies. Adaptation strategies relating to these climate change and health risks could be clustered according to categories common to many countries in the Pacific region. Conclusion: Pacific island countries are among the most vulnerable in the world to the health impacts of climate change. This vulnerability is a function of their unique geographic, demographic, and socioeconomic characteristics combined with their exposure to changing weather patterns associated with climate change, the health risks entailed, and the limited capacity of the countries to manage and adapt in the face of such risks.

347;Neglected Tropical Diseases in the Context of Climate Change in East Africa: A Systematic Scoping Review.;East Africa is highly affected by neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), which are projected to be exacerbated by climate change. Consequently, understanding what research has been conducted and what knowledge gaps remain regarding NTDs and climate change is crucial to informing public health interventions and climate change adaptation. We conducted a systematic scoping review to describe the extent, range, and nature of publications examining relationships between NTDs and climatic factors in East Africa. We collated all relevant English and French publications indexed in PubMed®, Web of Science™ Core Collection, and CAB Direct© databases published before 2019. Ninety-six publications were included for review. Kenya, Tanzania, and Ethiopia had high rates of publication, whereas countries in the Western Indian Ocean region were underrepresented. Most publications focused on schistosomiasis (n = 28, 29.2%), soil-transmitted helminthiases (n = 16, 16.7%), or human African trypanosomiasis (n = 14, 14.6%). Precipitation (n = 91, 94.8%) and temperature (n = 54, 56.3%) were frequently investigated climatic factors, whereas consideration of droughts (n = 10, 10.4%) and floods (n = 4, 4.2%) was not prominent. Publications reporting on associations between NTDs and changing climate were increasing over time. There was a decrease in the reporting of indigeneity and age factors over time. Overall, there were substantial knowledge gaps for several countries and for many NTDs. To better understand NTDs in the context of a changing climate, it would be helpful to increase research on underrepresented diseases and regions, consider demographic and social factors in research, and characterize how these factors modify the effects of climatic variables on NTDs in East Africa.

349;The intersection of climate change with the era of COVID‐19;"Abstract The purpose of this integrative review is to examine recent literature on the intersection of SARS‐CoV‐2 (COVID‐19 novel coronavirus) and climate change that will lead to a greater understanding of the complexities of the urgent pandemic linked with the emerging climate crisis. A literature search for peer‐reviewed, English language, literature published since the pandemic emerged was conducted using Cumulated Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), PubMed, and the Cochrane Library. The final sample yielded a total of 22 commentaries, editorials, discussion papers, and a research study that explicitly addressed the intersection of COVID‐19 and climate change. Sixty articles emerged in the initial review of the intersection of the COVID‐19 pandemic and climate change with the final yield of 22 articles deemed valid for inclusion after full text review. With the emergence of COVID‐19 and scholarly discourse that addresses the intersection of the pandemic with climate change, key issues emerged that intersect with policy /advocacy, social justice, and nursing's public health role in clinical practice, education, policy/advocacy, and research/scholarship. Five themes that emerged included the role of public health in COVID‐19 and climate change efforts; global approach addressing human‐environment issues; intersection of COVID‐19 and climate change from a community and global perspective; impacts of COVID‐19, climate change and the environment and professional associations and specialty organizations’ views and responsibilities with a lens on COVID‐19 and climate change. Despite the importance of addressing racial inequities as well as systemic and structural racism that impacts those most affected by climate change and pandemics such as COVID‐19, no literature addressed this topic. Public health nursing has a critical role in addressing climate change and the pandemic response to COVID 19 in the 21st century."
350;The effects of climate change on respiratory allergy and asthma induced by pollen and mold allergens;The impact of climate change on the environment, biosphere, and biodiversity has become more evident in the recent years. Human activities have increased atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide (CO2) and other greenhouse gases. Change in climate and the correlated global warming affects the quantity, intensity, and frequency of precipitation type as well as the frequency of extreme events such as heat waves, droughts, thunderstorms, floods, and hurricanes. Respiratory health can be particularly affected by climate change, which contributes to the development of allergic respiratory diseases and asthma. Pollen and mold allergens are able to trigger the release of pro‐inflammatory and immunomodulatory mediators that accelerate the onset the IgE‐mediated sensitization and of allergy. Allergy to pollen and pollen season at its beginning, in duration and intensity are altered by climate change. Studies showed that plants exhibit enhanced photosynthesis and reproductive effects and produce more pollen as a response to high atmospheric levels of carbon dioxide (CO2). Mold proliferation is increased by floods and rainy storms are responsible for severe asthma. Pollen and mold allergy is generally used to evaluate the interrelation between air pollution and allergic respiratory diseases, such as rhinitis and asthma. Thunderstorms during pollen seasons can cause exacerbation of respiratory allergy and asthma in patients with hay fever. A similar phenomenon is observed for molds. Measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions can have positive health benefits.
351;Health in climate change research from 1990 to 2014: positive trend, but still underperforming;Background Climate change has been recognized as both one of the biggest threats and the biggest opportunities for global health in the 21st century. This trend review seeks to assess and characterize the amount and type of scientific literature on the link between climate change and human health. Design We tracked the use of climate-related terms and their co-occurrence with health terms during the 25 years since the first Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) report, from 1990 to 2014, in two scientific databases and in the IPCC reports. We investigated the trends in the number of publications about health and climate change through time, by nature of the health impact under study, and by geographic area. We compared the scientific production in the health field with that of other sectors on which climate change has an impact. Results The number of publications was extremely low in both databases from 1990 (325 and 1,004, respectively) until around 2006 (1,332 and 4,319, respectively), which has since then increased exponentially in recent years (6,079 and 17,395, respectively, in 2014). However, the number of climate change papers regarding health is still about half that of other sectors. Certain health impacts, particularly malnutrition and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), remain substantially understudied. Approximately two-thirds of all published studies were carried out in OECD countries (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development), predominantly in Europe and North America. Conclusions There is a clear need for further research on the links between climate change and health. This pertains particularly to research in and by those countries in which health will be mostly affected and capacity to adapt is least. Specific undertreated topics such as NCDs, malnutrition, and mental health should gain the priority they deserve. Funding agencies are invited to take note of and establish calls for proposals accordingly. Raising the interest in this research area in young scientists remains a challenge and should lead to innovative courses for large audiences, such as Massive Open Online Courses.
352;Economic implications of climate change impacts on human health through undernourishment;This study quantified the impacts of climate change on human health through undernourishment using two economic measures. First, changes in morbidity and mortality due to nine diseases caused by being underweight as a child were analyzed using a Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model with changes in the labor force, population, and demands for healthcare taken into consideration. Second, changes in mortality were taken from the CGE simulation and assessed economically by the value of lives lost and willingness to pay to reduce the risk. Model uncertainties in future crop yields and climate conditions were considered using future projections from six global crop models and five global climate models. We found that the economic valuation of healthy lives lost due to undernourishment under climate change was equivalent to −0.4 % to 0.0 % of global gross domestic product (GDP) and was regionally heterogeneous, ranging from −4.0 % to 0.0 % of regional GDP in 2100. In contrast, the actual economic losses associated with the effects of additional health expenditure and the decrease in the labor force due to undernourishment resulting from climate change corresponded to a − 0.1 % to 0.0 % change in GDP and a − 0.2 % to 0.0 % change in household consumption, respectively, at the global level.
353;Climate Change, Extreme Weather Events, and Human Health Implications in the Asia Pacific Region;The Asia Pacific region is regarded as the most disaster-prone area of the world. Since 2000, 1.2 billion people have been exposed to hydrometeorological hazards alone through 1215 disaster events. The impacts of climate change on meteorological phenomena and environmental consequences are well documented. However, the impacts on health are more elusive. Nevertheless, climate change is believed to alter weather patterns on the regional scale, giving rise to extreme weather events. The impacts from extreme weather events are definitely more acute and traumatic in nature, leading to deaths and injuries, as well as debilitating and fatal communicable diseases. Extreme weather events include heat waves, cold waves, floods, droughts, hurricanes, tropical cyclones, heavy rain, and snowfalls. Globally, within the 20-year period from 1993 to 2012, more than 530 000 people died as a direct result of almost 15 000 extreme weather events, with losses of more than US$2.5 trillion in purchasing power parity.
354;The largely unacknowledged impact of climate change on mental health;ABSTRACT In all of the coverage of climate change in the popular press, relatively little attention has been paid to one aspect: mental health. Rising seawaters, increasingly strong storms, and more ferocious droughts caused by climate change are not only devastating to physical infrastructure but also affect human beings in other ways as well: people lose their homes, their jobs, their family members, and their communities. Researchers have found that climate change can cause not only posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) from the trauma of displacement from extreme weather events such as Hurricane Katrina but also “pre-traumatic” stress disorder, or, moderate to extreme anxiety about a looming crisis. This paper describes some of these effects, who is most vulnerable to them, some of the social factors involved, and offers some suggestions for possible solutions.
355;Water-Related Impacts of Climate Change on Agriculture and Subsequently on Public Health: A Review for Generalists with Particular Reference to Pakistan;Water-related impacts due to change in climatic conditions ranging from water scarcity to intense floods and storms are increasing in developing countries like Pakistan. Water quality and waterborne diseases like hepatitis, cholera, typhoid, malaria and dengue fever are increasing due to chaotic urbanization, industrialization, poor hygienic conditions, and inappropriate water management. The morbidity rate is high due to lack of health care facilities, especially in developing countries. Organizations linked to the Government of Pakistan (e.g., Ministry of Environment, Ministry of Climate Change, Planning and Development, Ministry of Forest, Irrigation and Public Health, Pakistan Meteorological Department, National Disaster Management, Pakistan Agricultural Research Centre, Pakistan Council for Research in Water Resources, and Global Change Impact Study Centre), United Nation organizations, provincial government departments, non-governmental organizations (e.g., Global Facility and Disaster Reduction), research centers linked to universities, and international organizations (International Institute for Sustainable Development, Food and Agriculture, Global Climate Fund and World Bank) are trying to reduce the water-related impacts of climate change, but due to lack of public awareness and health care infrastructure, the death rate is steadily increasing. This paper critically reviews the scientific studies and reports both at national and at international level benefiting generalists concerned with environmental and public health challenges. The article underlines the urgent need for water conservation, risk management, and the development of mitigation measures to cope with the water-related impacts of climate change on agriculture and subsequently on public health. Novel solutions and bioremediation methods have been presented to control environmental pollution and to promote awareness among the scientific community. The focus is on diverse strategies to handle the forthcoming challenges associated with water resources management.
356;Climate Change and Public Health Policy: Translating the Science;Public health authorities are required to prepare for future threats and need predictions of the likely impact of climate change on public health risks. They may get overwhelmed by the volume of heterogeneous information in scientific articles and risk relying purely on the public opinion articles which focus mainly on global warming trends, and leave out many other relevant factors. In the current paper, we discuss various scientific approaches investigating climate change and its possible impact on public health and discuss their different roles and functions in unraveling the complexity of the subject. It is not our objective to review the available literature or to make predictions for certain diseases or countries, but rather to evaluate the applicability of scientific research articles on climate change to evidence-based public health decisions. In the context of mosquito borne diseases, we identify common pitfalls to watch out for when assessing scientific research on the impact of climate change on human health. We aim to provide guidance through the plethora of scientific papers and views on the impact of climate change on human health to those new to the subject, as well as to remind public health experts of its multifactorial and multidisciplinary character.
357;Cardiovascular risks of climate change;Extreme heat events are now more frequent in many parts of the world as a result of climate change. The combined effects of heat, air pollution, individual age, and socioeconomic and health status are responsible for avoidable acute events of cardiovascular disease and need to be considered in order to prevent and treat cardiovascular diseases effectively.
358;Lungs in a warming world: climate change and respiratory health.;Climate change is a health threat no less consequential than cigarette smoking. Increased concentrations of greenhouse gases, and especially CO₂, in the earth's atmosphere have already warmed the planet substantially, causing more severe and prolonged heat waves, temperature variability, air pollution, forest fires, droughts, and floods, all of which put respiratory health at risk. These changes in climate and air quality substantially increase respiratory morbidity and mortality for patients with common chronic lung diseases such as asthma and COPD and other serious lung diseases. Physicians have a vital role in addressing climate change, just as they did with tobacco, by communicating how climate change is a serious, but remediable, hazard to their patients.
359;How Well Does Climate Change and Human Health Research Match the Demands of Policymakers? A Scoping Review;Background: In 2008, the World Health Organization (WHO) Member States passed a World Health Assembly resolution that identified the following five priority areas for research and pilot projects on climate change and human health: health vulnerability, health protection, health impacts of mitigation and adaptation policies, decision-support and other tools, and costs of health protection from climate change. Objectives: To assess the extent to which recently published research corresponds to these priorities, we undertook a scoping review of original research on climate change and human health. Scoping reviews address topics that are too broad for a systematic review and commonly aim to identify research gaps in existing literature. We also assessed recent publication trends for climate change and health research. Methods: We searched for original quantitative research published from 2008 onward. We included disease burden studies that were specific to climate change and health and included intervention studies that focused on climate change and measured health outcomes. We used MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases and extracted data on research priority areas, geographic regions, health fields, and equity (systematic differences between advantaged and disadvantaged social groups). Discussion: We identified 40 eligible studies. Compared with other health topics, the number of climate change publications has grown rapidly, with a larger proportion of reviews or editorials. Recent original research addressed four of the five priority areas identified by the WHO Member States, but we found no eligible studies of health adaptation interventions, and most of the studies focused on high-income countries. Conclusions: Climate change and health is a rapidly growing area of research, but quantitative studies remain rare. Among recently published studies, we found gaps in adaptation research and a deficit of studies in most developing regions. Funders and researchers should monitor and respond to research gaps to help ensure that the needs of policymakers are met.
360;The Unique Role of Medical Students in Catalyzing Climate Change Education;Climate change is a well-recognized threat to human health with impacts on every organ system and with implications for disease processes across subspecialties. Climate-driven environmental exposures influence the pathophysiologic underpinnings of disease emphasized in the pre-clinical years of medical school. While medical schools are beginning to offer climate change and health electives, medical education is lagging in providing fundamental climate-and-health content to adequately prepare the next generation of physicians for the challenges that they will face in the provision of healthcare and the prevention and treatment of disease. This perspective piece highlights the unique role of medical students in catalyzing the incorporation of climate content into the pre-clinical medical school curriculum and provides topics for disseminated curricular integration with the concepts emphasized in the pre-clinical years of medical education.
361;Climate Change and Collective Violence;Climate change is causing increases in temperature, changes in precipitation and extreme weather events, sea-level rise, and other environmental impacts. It is also causing or contributing to heat-related disorders, respiratory and allergic disorders, infectious diseases, malnutrition due to food insecurity, and mental health disorders. In addition, increasing evidence indicates that climate change is causally associated with collective violence, generally in combination with other causal factors. Increased temperatures and extremes of precipitation with their associated consequences, including resultant scarcity of cropland and other key environmental resources, are major pathways by which climate change leads to collective violence. Public health professionals can help prevent collective violence due to climate change (a) by supporting mitigation measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, (b) by promoting adaptation measures to address the consequences of climate change and to improve community resilience, and (c) by addressing underlying risk factors for collective violence, such as poverty and socioeconomic disparities.
362;Climate Change, Water Quality and Water-Related Challenges: A Review with Focus on Pakistan;"Climate variability is heavily impacting human health all around the globe, in particular, on residents of developing countries. Impacts on surface water and groundwater resources and water-related illnesses are increasing, especially under changing climate scenarios such as diversity in rainfall patterns, increasing temperature, flash floods, severe droughts, heatwaves and heavy precipitation. Emerging water-related diseases such as dengue fever and chikungunya are reappearing and impacting on the life of the deprived; as such, the provision of safe water and health care is in great demand in developing countries to combat the spread of infectious diseases. Government, academia and private water bodies are conducting water quality surveys and providing health care facilities, but there is still a need to improve the present strategies concerning water treatment and management, as well as governance. In this review paper, climate change pattern and risks associated with water-related diseases in developing countries, with particular focus on Pakistan, and novel methods for controlling both waterborne and water-related diseases are discussed. This study is important for public health care, particularly in developing countries, for policy makers, and researchers working in the area of climate change, water quality and risk assessment."
363;Five Lessons from COVID-19 for Advancing Climate Change Mitigation;The nexus of COVID-19 and climate change has so far brought attention to short-term greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions, public health responses, and clean recovery stimulus packages. We take a more holistic approach, making five broad comparisons between the crises with five associated lessons for climate change mitigation policy. First, delay is costly. Second, policy design must overcome biases to human judgment. Third, inequality can be exacerbated without timely action. Fourth, global problems require multiple forms of international cooperation. Fifth, transparency of normative positions is needed to navigate value judgments at the science-policy interface. Learning from policy challenges during the COVID-19 crisis could enhance efforts to reduce GHG emissions and prepare humanity for future crises.
364;The Critical Roles of Health Professionals in Climate Change Prevention and Preparedness.;"Climate change is a burgeoning public health concern, with implications for chronic health conditions; nutrition and food security; food-, water-, and vector-borne diseases; and social disruption, injuries, displacement, and death associated with extreme weather.1 Climate change is contributing to health disparities in the United States by having a disproportionate impact on low-income individuals, some communities of color, and those with higher vulnerability to chronic health conditions.1 Moreover, these vulnerabilities can co-occur. (Am J Public Health. Published online ahead of print October 26, 2017: e1-e2. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2017.304044)."
365;Smartphone Apps for Measuring Human Health and Climate Change Co-Benefits: A Comparison and Quality Rating of Available Apps;"Background Climate change and the burden of noncommunicable diseases are major global challenges. Opportunities exist to investigate health and climate change co-benefits through a shift from motorized to active transport (walking and cycling) and a shift in dietary patterns away from a globalized diet to reduced consumption of meat and energy dense foods. Given the ubiquitous use and proliferation of smartphone apps, an opportunity exists to use this technology to capture individual travel and dietary behavior and the associated impact on the environment and health. Objective The objective of the study is to identify, describe the features, and rate the quality of existing smartphone apps which capture personal travel and dietary behavior and simultaneously estimate the carbon cost and potential health consequences of these actions. Methods The Google Play and Apple App Stores were searched between October 19 and November 6, 2015, and a secondary Google search using the apps filter was conducted between August 8 and September 18, 2016. Eligible apps were required to estimate the carbon cost of personal behaviors with the potential to include features to maximize health outcomes. The quality of included apps was assessed by 2 researchers using the Mobile Application Rating Scale (MARS). Results Out of 7213 results, 40 apps were identified and rated. Multiple travel-related apps were identified, however no apps solely focused on the carbon impact or health consequences of dietary behavior. None of the rated apps provided sufficient information on the health consequences of travel and dietary behavior. Some apps included features to maximize participant engagement and encourage behavior change towards reduced greenhouse gas emissions. Most apps were rated as acceptable quality as determined by the MARS; 1 was of poor quality and 10 apps were of good quality. Interrater reliability of the 2 evaluators was excellent (ICC=0.94, 95% CI 0.87-0.97). Conclusions Existing apps capturing travel and dietary behavior and the associated health and environmental impact are of mixed quality. Most apps do not include all desirable features or provide sufficient health information. Further research is needed to determine the potential of smartphone apps to evoke behavior change resulting in climate change and health co-benefits."
366;Public Health Adaptation to Climate Change in Large Cities;"Climate change will have significant impacts on human health, and urban populations are expected to be highly sensitive. The health risks from climate change in cities are compounded by rapid urbanization, high population density, and climate-sensitive built environments. Local governments are positioned to protect populations from climate health risks, but it is unclear whether municipalities are producing climate-adaptive policies. In this article, we develop and apply systematic methods to assess the state of public health adaptation in 401 urban areas globally with more than 1 million people, creating the first global baseline for urban public health adaptation. We find that only 10% of the sampled urban areas report any public health adaptation initiatives. The initiatives identified most frequently address risks posed by extreme weather events and involve direct changes in management or behavior rather than capacity building, research, or long-term investments in infrastructure. Based on our characterization of the current urban health adaptation landscape, we identify several gaps: limited evidence of reporting of institutional adaptation at the municipal level in urban areas in the Global South; lack of information-based adaptation initiatives; limited focus on initiatives addressing infectious disease risks; and absence of monitoring, reporting, and evaluation."
367;Climate Change and Respiratory Infections.;The rate of global warming has accelerated over the past 50 years. Increasing surface temperature is melting glaciers and raising the sea level. More flooding, droughts, hurricanes, and heat waves are being reported. Accelerated changes in climate are already affecting human health, in part by altering the epidemiology of climate-sensitive pathogens. In particular, climate change may alter the incidence and severity of respiratory infections by affecting vectors and host immune responses. Certain respiratory infections, such as avian influenza and coccidioidomycosis, are occurring in locations previously unaffected, apparently because of global warming. Young children and older adults appear to be particularly vulnerable to rapid fluctuations in ambient temperature. For example, an increase in the incidence in childhood pneumonia in Australia has been associated with sharp temperature drops from one day to the next. Extreme weather events, such as heat waves, floods, major storms, drought, and wildfires, are also believed to change the incidence of respiratory infections. An outbreak of aspergillosis among Japanese survivors of the 2011 tsunami is one such well-documented example. Changes in temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and air pollution influence viral activity and transmission. For example, in early 2000, an outbreak of Hantavirus respiratory disease was linked to a local increase in the rodent population, which in turn was attributed to a two- to threefold increase in rainfall before the outbreak. Climate-sensitive respiratory pathogens present challenges to respiratory health that may be far greater in the foreseeable future.
368;Sport and climate change—how will climate change affect sport?;Climate change will have complex consequences for the environment, society, economy and people’s health. The issue of climate change has received comparatively little attention to date in the fields of sports science. Thus, sport-related health risks caused by climate change are discussed and summarized in a conceptual model presented here for the first time. Climate change is associated with the following increases of health-related risks for athletes in particular: Direct consequences caused by extreme temperature and other extreme weather events (e.g. increasing risks due to heatwaves, thunderstorms, floods, lightning, ultraviolet radiation) and indirect consequences as a result of climate-induced changes to our ecosystem (e.g. due to increased air pollution by ozone, higher exposures to allergens, increasing risks of infection by viruses and bacteria and the associated vectors and reservoir organisms). Each aspect is supplemented with advice on the prevention of health hazards. Not only individual athletes but also sports organizations and local clubs will have to respond to the changes in our climate, so that they can appropriately protect both athletes and spectators and ensure a plannable continuation of the sport in the future.
369;Health Aspects of Climate Change in Cities with Mediterranean Climate, and Local Adaptation Plans;Cities with a Mediterranean-type climate (Med-cities) are particularly susceptible to health risks from climate change since they are located in biogeographical hot-spots that experience some of the strongest effects of the changing climate. The study aims to highlight health impacts of climate change in Med-cities, analyze local climate adaptation plans and make adaptation policy recommendations for the Med-city level. We identified five Med-cities with a climate change adaptation plan: Adelaide, Barcelona, Cape Town, Los Angeles and Santiago. Beyond their similar Med-climate features (although Santiago’s are slightly different), the cities have different socio-economic characteristics in various aspects. We analyzed each plan according to how it addresses climate change-related drivers of health impacts among city dwellers. For each driver, we identified the types of policy adaptation tools that address it in the urban climate adaptation plans. The surveyed cities address most of the fundamental climate change-related drivers of risks to human health, including rising temperatures, flooding and drought, but the policy measures to reduce negative impacts vary across cities. We suggest recommendations for Med-cities in various aspects, depending on their local needs and vulnerability challenges: assessment of health risks, extreme events management and long-term adaptation, among others.
370;Adapting to the Changing Climate: An Assessment of Local Health Department Preparations for Climate Change-Related Health Threats, 2008-2012;"Background Climate change poses a major public health threat. A survey of U.S. local health department directors in 2008 found widespread recognition of the threat, but limited adaptive capacity, due to perceived lack of expertise and other resources. Methods We assessed changes between 2008 and 2012 in local public health departments' preparedness for the public health threats of climate change, in light of increasing national polarization on the issue, and widespread funding cutbacks for public health. A geographically representative online survey of directors of local public health departments was conducted in 2011–2012 (N = 174; response rate = 50%), and compared to the 2008 telephone survey results (N = 133; response rate = 61%). Results Significant polarization had occurred: more respondents in 2012 were certain that the threat of local climate change impacts does/does not exist, and fewer were unsure. Roughly 10% said it is not a threat, compared to 1% in 2008. Adaptation capacity decreased in several areas: perceived departmental expertise in climate change risk assessment; departmental prioritization of adaptation; and the number of adaptation-related programs and services departments provided. In 2008, directors' perceptions of local impacts predicted the number of adaptation-related programs and services their departments offered, but in 2012, funding predicted programming and directors' impact perceptions did not. This suggests that budgets were constraining directors' ability to respond to local climate change-related health threats. Results also suggest that departmental expertise may mitigate funding constraints. Strategies for overcoming these obstacles to local public health departments' preparations for climate change are discussed."
371;Public Health Adaptation to Climate Change in OECD Countries;"Climate change is a major challenge facing public health. National governments play a key role in public health adaptation to climate change, but there are competing views on what responsibilities and obligations this will—or should—include in different nations. This study aims to: (1) examine how national-level public health adaptation is occurring in Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries; (2) examine the roles national governments are taking in public health adaptation; and (3) critically appraise three key governance dimensions of national-level health adaptation—cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning—and identify practical examples suited to different contexts. We systematically reviewed publicly available public health adaptation to climate change documents and webpages by national governments in ten OECD countries using systematic web searches, assessment of self-reporting, and content analysis. Our findings suggest national governments are primarily addressing infectious disease and heat-related risks posed by climate change, typically emphasizing capacity building or information-based groundwork initiatives. We find national governments are taking a variety of approaches to public health adaptation to climate change that do not follow expected convergence and divergence by governance structure. We discuss practical options for incorporating cross-sectoral collaboration, vertical coordination and national health adaptation planning into a variety of contexts and identify leaders national governments can look to to inform their public health adaptation planning. Following the adoption of the Paris Agreement and subsequent increased momentum for adaptation, research tracking adaptation is needed to define what health adaptation looks like in practice, reveal insights that can be taken up across states and sectors, and ensure policy orientated learning."
372;Developing effective communication materials on the health effects of climate change for vulnerable groups: a mixed methods study;"BackgroundIndividuals with chronic health conditions or low socioeconomic status (SES) are more vulnerable to the health impacts of climate change. Health communication can provide information on the management of these impacts. This study tested, among vulnerable audiences, whether viewing targeted materials increases knowledge about the health impacts of climate change and strength of climate change beliefs, and whether each are associated with stronger intentions to practice recommended behaviors.MethodsLow-SES respondents with chronic conditions were recruited for an online survey in six cities. Respondents were shown targeted materials illustrating the relationship between climate change and chronic conditions. Changes in knowledge and climate change beliefs (pre- and post-test) and behavioral intentions (post-test only) were tested using McNemar tests of marginal frequencies of two binary outcomes or paired t-tests, and multivariable linear regression. Qualitative interviews were conducted among target audiences to triangulate survey findings and make recommendations on the design of messages.ResultsRespondents (N = 122) reflected the target population regarding income, educational level and prevalence of household health conditions. (1) Knowledge. Significant increases in knowledge were found regarding: groups that are most vulnerable to heat (children [p < 0.001], individuals with heart disease [p < 0.001], or lung disease [p = 0.019]); and environmental conditions that increase allergy-producing pollen (increased heat [p = 0.003], increased carbon dioxide [p < 0.001]). (2) Strength of certainty that climate change is happening increased significantly between pre- and post-test (p < 0.001), as did belief that climate change affected respondents’ health (p < 0.001). (3) Behavioral intention. At post-test, higher knowledge of heat vulnerabilities and environmental conditions that trigger pollen allergies were associated with greater behavioral intention scores (p = 0.001 and p = 0.002, respectively). In-depth interviews (N = 15) revealed that vulnerable audiences are interested in immediate-term advice on health management and protective behaviors related to their chronic conditions, but took less notice of messages about collective action to slow or stop climate change. Respondents identified both appealing and less favorable design elements in the materials.ConclusionsIndividuals who are vulnerable to the health effects of climate change benefit from communication materials that explain, using graphics and concise language, how climate change affects health conditions and how to engage in protective adaptation behaviors."
373;Global Air Quality and Health Co-benefits of Mitigating Near-Term Climate Change through Methane and Black Carbon Emission Controls;"Background: Tropospheric ozone and black carbon (BC), a component of fine particulate matter (PM ≤ 2.5 µm in aerodynamic diameter; PM2.5), are associated with premature mortality and they disrupt global and regional climate. Objectives: We examined the air quality and health benefits of 14 specific emission control measures targeting BC and methane, an ozone precursor, that were selected because of their potential to reduce the rate of climate change over the next 20–40 years. Methods: We simulated the impacts of mitigation measures on outdoor concentrations of PM2.5 and ozone using two composition-climate models, and calculated associated changes in premature PM2.5- and ozone-related deaths using epidemiologically derived concentration–response functions. Results: We estimated that, for PM2.5 and ozone, respectively, fully implementing these measures could reduce global population-weighted average surface concentrations by 23–34% and 7–17% and avoid 0.6–4.4 and 0.04–0.52 million annual premature deaths globally in 2030. More than 80% of the health benefits are estimated to occur in Asia. We estimated that BC mitigation measures would achieve approximately 98% of the deaths that would be avoided if all BC and methane mitigation measures were implemented, due to reduced BC and associated reductions of nonmethane ozone precursor and organic carbon emissions as well as stronger mortality relationships for PM2.5 relative to ozone. Although subject to large uncertainty, these estimates and conclusions are not strongly dependent on assumptions for the concentration–response function. Conclusions: In addition to climate benefits, our findings indicate that the methane and BC emission control measures would have substantial co-benefits for air quality and public health worldwide, potentially reversing trends of increasing air pollution concentrations and mortality in Africa and South, West, and Central Asia. These projected benefits are independent of carbon dioxide mitigation measures. Benefits of BC measures are underestimated because we did not account for benefits from reduced indoor exposures and because outdoor exposure estimates were limited by model spatial resolution."
374;Climate Change and Future Pollen Allergy in Europe;"Background: Globally, pollen allergy is a major public health problem, but a fundamental unknown is the likely impact of climate change. To our knowledge, this is the first study to quantify the consequences of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans. Objectives: We produced quantitative estimates of the potential impact of climate change upon pollen allergy in humans, focusing upon common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia) in Europe. Methods: A process-based model estimated the change in ragweed’s range under climate change. A second model simulated current and future ragweed pollen levels. These findings were translated into health burdens using a dose–response curve generated from a systematic review and from current and future population data. Models considered two different suites of regional climate/pollen models, two greenhouse gas emissions scenarios [Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 4.5 and 8.5], and three different plant invasion scenarios. Results: Our primary estimates indicated that sensitization to ragweed will more than double in Europe, from 33 to 77 million people, by 2041–2060. According to our projections, sensitization will increase in countries with an existing ragweed problem (e.g., Hungary, the Balkans), but the greatest proportional increases will occur where sensitization is uncommon (e.g., Germany, Poland, France). Higher pollen concentrations and a longer pollen season may also increase the severity of symptoms. Our model projections were driven predominantly by changes in climate (66%) but were also influenced by current trends in the spread of this invasive plant species. Assumptions about the rate at which ragweed spreads throughout Europe had a large influence upon the results. Conclusions: Our quantitative estimates indicate that ragweed pollen allergy will become a common health problem across Europe, expanding into areas where it is currently uncommon. Control of ragweed spread may be an important adaptation strategy in response to climate change.

375;Climate Change and Its Impact in Nigerian Economy;Climate change has become a great challenge to our generation and its impact is felt in almost  every society in the world. Nigeria as a developing country with a population of about 180 million is  likely to be adversely impacted by climate change due to its vulnerability and low coping capability.  Evidences have shown that climate change impacts on Nigeria arises from various climate change  related causes experienced due to the increase in temperature, rainfall, sea level rise, impact on  fresh water resources, extreme weather events, flooding, drought in the north and increased health  risk. The study reviews some existing literatures, information, policies, and data on climate change  in Nigeria and its impact on the various sectors of the economy. The finding for this paper indicates  that many sectors of Nigerian economy appear to be directly vulnerable to the impacts of climate  change such as agricultural sector, health, energy, etc. This generally affects the growth of  economy. The impacts of climate changed highlighted in this study raise the need for more support  in research and education awareness on the impact of climate change in Nigeria. This review  attempts to create awareness on the impacts of climate change in Nigeria and presents some  policy recommendations for adaptation and mitigation measures to tackle the challenges.
376;Smart agriculture for food quality: facing climate change in the 21st century;Abstract Climate change, with increasing temperatures and atmospheric carbon dioxide levels, constitutes a severe threat to the environment and all living organisms. In particular, numerous studies suggest severe consequences for the health of crop plants, affecting both the productivity and quality of raw material destined to the food industry. Of particular concern is the reduction of proteins and essential micronutrients as iron and zinc in crops. Fighting this alarming trends is the challenge of Climate-Smart Agriculture with the double goal of reducing environmental impacts (use of pesticides, nitrogen and phosphorus leaching, soil erosion, water depletion and contamination) and improving raw material and consequently food quality. Organic farming, biofertilizers and to a lesser extent nano-carriers, improve the antioxidant properties of fruits, but the data about proteins and micronutrients are rather contradictory. On the other hand, advanced devices and Precision Agriculture allow the cultivations to be more profitable, efficient, contributing more and more to reduce pest diseases and to increase the quality of agricultural products and food safety. Thus, nowadays adoption of technologies applied to sustainable farming systems is a challenging and dynamic issue for facing negative trends due to environmental impacts and climate changes.
377;Health risks of climate change in the World Health Organization South-East Asia Region;"Countries in the World Health Organization (WHO) South-East Asia Region are particularly vulnerable to a changing climate. Changes in extreme weather events, undernutrition and the spread of infectious diseases are projected to increase the number of deaths due to climate change by 2030, indicating the need to strengthen activities for adaptation and mitigation. With support from the WHO Regional Office for South-East Asia and others, countries have started to include climate change as a key consideration in their national public health policies. Further efforts are needed to develop evidence-based responses; garner the necessary support from partner ministries; and access funding for activities related to health and climate change. National action plans for climate change generally identify health as one of their priorities; however, limited information is available on implementation processes, including which ministries and departments would be involved; the time frame; stakeholder responsibilities; and how the projects would be financed. While progress is being made, efforts are needed to increase the capacity of health systems to manage the health risks of climate change in South-East Asia, if population health is to be protected and strengthened while addressing changing weather and climate patterns. Enhancing the resilience of health systems is key to ensuring a sustainable path to improved planetary and population health."
378;Scoping the proximal and distal dimensions of climate change on health and wellbeing;The impacts of climate on health and wellbeing occur in time and space and through a range of indirect, complicated mechanisms. This diversity of pathways has major implications for national public health planning and influence on interventions that might help to mitigate and adapt to rapidly changing environmental conditions, nationally and internationally. This paper draws upon evidence from public health and adverse impact studies across climate science, hydrology, agriculture, public health, and the social sciences. It presents a conceptual model to support decision-making by recognizing both the proximal and distal pathways from climate-induced environmental change to national health and wellbeing. The proximal and distal pathways associated with food security, migration and mobility illustrate the diverse climate change influences in different geographic locations over different timescales. We argue that greater realization and articulation of proximal and distal pathways should radically alter how climate change is addressed as a national and international public health challenge.
379;Impact of climate change on human health and health systems in Tanzania: a review.;"Climate change (CC) has a number of immediate and long-term impacts on the fundamental determinants of human health. A number of potential human health effects have been associated either directly or indirectly with global climate change. Vulnerability to the risks associated with CC may exacerbate ongoing socio-economic challenges. The objective of this review was to analyse the potential risk and vulnerability in the context of climate-sensitive human diseases and health system in Tanzania. Climate sensitive vector- and waterborne diseases and other health related problems and the policies on climate adaptation in Tanzania during the past 50 years are reviewed. The review has shown that a number of climate-associated infectious disease epidemics have been reported in various areas of the country; mostly being associated with increase in precipitation and temperature. Although, there is no single policy document that specifically addresses issues of CC in the country, the National Environmental Management Act of 1997 recognizes the importance of CC and calls for the government to put up measures to address the phenomenon. A number of strategies and action plans related to CC are also in place. These include the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan, the National Action Programme, and the National Bio-safety Framework. The government has put in place a National Climate Change Steering Committee and the National Climate Change Technical Committee to oversee and guide the implementation of CC activities in the country. Recognizing the adverse impacts of natural disasters and calamities, the government established a Disaster Management Division under the Prime Minister's Office. Epidemic Preparedness and Response Unit of the Ministry of Health and Social Welfare is responsible for emergency preparedness, mostly disease outbreaks. However, specific climate changes associated with human health issues are poorly addressed in the MoHSW strategies and the national health research priorities. In conclusion, CC threatens to slow, halt or reverses the progress the country has made or is making to achieve its national and millennium development goals. It is therefore important that Tanzania prepares itself to appropriately address CC impact on human health. It is equally important that policy makers and other stakeholders are engaged in a process to update and adapt priorities, mobilize resources and build interdisciplinary research and implementation capacity on climate change and its mitigation."
380;Review: the nexus of climate change, food and nutrition security and diet-related non-communicable diseases in Pacific Island Countries and Territories;ABSTRACT Climate change and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) are two of the most important global health challenges of this century. Pacific island countries and territories (PICTs) are particularly vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change and face an increasingly high burden of NCDs. This review synthesizes the evidence for the links between climate change, food and nutrition security (FNS) and NCDs in the Pacific region and outlines the possible implications of these relationships. A comprehensive search was performed on global databases including PubMed, SCOPUS and ScienceDirect, the grey literature and reference lists. Four dominant pathways between climate change, FNS and NCDs emerged from the literature: the impact of climate change on agriculture, fisheries, migration and humanitarian food assistance. These pathways, if not addressed, are likely to lead to impaired FNS and an increased burden of NCDs in PICTs. There is little doubt that Pacific nations will experience adverse impacts of climate change exacerbating existing health risks and other socio-cultural, political and economic drivers of food and nutrition insecurity and NCDs. Further research is needed to strengthen the evidence and develop integrated, context-specific solutions. It is, however, imperative to take action to address these issues via a cross-sectoral, no-regrets, health-in-all-policies approach.
381;Impact of recent and future climate change on vector‐borne diseases;"Climate change is one of the greatest threats to human health in the 21st century. Climate directly impacts health through climatic extremes, air quality, sea‐level rise, and multifaceted influences on food production systems and water resources. Climate also affects infectious diseases, which have played a significant role in human history, impacting the rise and fall of civilizations and facilitating the conquest of new territories. Our review highlights significant regional changes in vector and pathogen distribution reported in temperate, peri‐Arctic, Arctic, and tropical highland regions during recent decades, changes that have been anticipated by scientists worldwide. Further future changes are likely if we fail to mitigate and adapt to climate change. Many key factors affect the spread and severity of human diseases, including mobility of people, animals, and goods; control measures in place; availability of effective drugs; quality of public health services; human behavior; and political stability and conflicts. With drug and insecticide resistance on the rise, significant funding and research efforts must to be maintained to continue the battle against existing and emerging diseases, particularly those that are vector borne."
382;Responsibilities of the Occupational and Environmental Medicine Provider in the Treatment and Prevention of Climate Change-Related Health Problems;"&NA; Workers are uniquely susceptible to the health hazards imposed by environmental changes. Occupational and environmental medicine (OEM) providers are at the forefront of emerging health issues pertaining to working populations including climate change, and must be prepared to recognize, respond to, and mitigate climate change-related health effects in workers. This guidance document from the American College of Occupational and Environmental Medicine focuses on North American workers health effects that may occur as a result of climate change and describes the responsibilities of the OEM provider in responding to these health challenges."
383;Climate change: challenges and opportunities for global health.;"IMPORTANCE Health is inextricably linked to climate change. It is important for clinicians to understand this relationship in order to discuss associated health risks with their patients and to inform public policy.   OBJECTIVES To provide new US-based temperature projections from downscaled climate modeling and to review recent studies on health risks related to climate change and the cobenefits of efforts to mitigate greenhouse gas emissions.   DATA SOURCES, STUDY SELECTION, AND DATA SYNTHESIS We searched PubMed and Google Scholar from 2009 to 2014 for articles related to climate change and health, focused on governmental reports, predictive models, and empirical epidemiological studies. Of the more than 250 abstracts reviewed, 56 articles were selected. In addition, we analyzed climate data averaged over 13 climate models and based future projections on downscaled probability distributions of the daily maximum temperature for 2046-2065. We also compared maximum daily 8-hour average ozone with air temperature data taken from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, National Climate Data Center.   RESULTS By 2050, many US cities may experience more frequent extreme heat days. For example, New York and Milwaukee may have 3 times their current average number of days hotter than 32°C (90°F). High temperatures are also strongly associated with ozone exceedance days, for example, in Chicago, Illinois. The adverse health aspects related to climate change may include heat-related disorders, such as heat stress and economic consequences of reduced work capacity; respiratory disorders, including those exacerbated by air pollution and aeroallergens, such as asthma; infectious diseases, including vectorborne diseases and waterborne diseases, such as childhood gastrointestinal diseases; food insecurity, including reduced crop yields and an increase in plant diseases; and mental health disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, that are associated with natural disasters. Substantial health and economic cobenefits could be associated with reductions in fossil fuel combustion. For example, greenhouse gas emission policies may yield net economic benefit, with health benefits from air quality improvements potentially offsetting the cost of US and international carbon policies.   CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Evidence over the past 20 years indicates that climate change can be associated with adverse health outcomes. Health care professionals have an important role in understanding and communicating the related potential health concerns and the cobenefits from policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
384;Mapping vulnerability to climate change and its repercussions on human health in Pakistan;"BackgroundPakistan is highly vulnerable to climate change due to its geographic location, high dependence on agriculture and water resources, low adaptive capacity of its people, and weak system of emergency preparedness. This paper is the first ever attempt to rank the agro-ecological zones in Pakistan according to their vulnerability to climate change and to identify the potential health repercussions of each manifestation of climate change in the context of Pakistan.MethodsA climate change vulnerability index is constructed as an un-weighted average of three sub-indices measuring (a) the ecological exposure of each region to climate change, (b) sensitivity of the population to climate change and (c) the adaptive capacity of the population inhabiting a particular region. The regions are ranked according to the value of this index and its components. Since health is one of the most important dimensions of human wellbeing, this paper also identifies the potential health repercussions of each manifestations of climate change and links it with the key manifestations of climate change in the context of Pakistan.ResultsThe results indicate that Balochistan is the most vulnerable region with high sensitivity and low adaptive capacity followed by low-intensity Punjab (mostly consisting of South Punjab) and Cotton/Wheat Sindh. The health risks that each of these regions face depend upon the type of threat that they face from climate change. Greater incidence of flooding, which may occur due to climate variability, poses the risk of diarrhoea and gastroenteritis; skin and eye Infections; acute respiratory infections; and malaria. Exposure to drought poses the potential health risks in the form of food insecurity and malnutrition; anaemia; night blindness; and scurvy. Increases in temperature pose health risks of heat stroke; malaria; dengue; respiratory diseases; and cardiovascular diseases.ConclusionThe study concludes that geographical zones that are more exposed to climate change in ecological and geographic terms- such as Balochistan, Low-Intensity Punjab, and Cotton-Wheat Sindh -also happen to be the most deprived regions in Pakistan in terms of socio-economic indicators, suggesting that the government needs to direct its efforts to the socio-economic uplift of these lagging regions to reduce their vulnerability to the adverse effects of climate change."
385;Climate change, food, water and population health in China;Abstract Anthropogenic climate change appears to be increasing the frequency, duration and intensity of extreme weather events. Such events have already had substantial impacts on socioeconomic development and population health. Climate change’s most profound impacts are likely to be on food, health systems and water. This paper explores how climate change will affect food, human health and water in China. Projections indicate that the overall effects of climate change, land conversion and reduced water availability could reduce Chinese food production substantially – although uncertainty is inevitable in such projections. Climate change will probably have substantial impacts on water resources – e.g. changes in rainfall patterns and increases in the frequencies of droughts and floods in some areas of China. Such impacts would undoubtedly threaten population health and well-being in many communities. In the short-term, population health in China is likely to be adversely affected by increases in air temperatures and pollution. In the medium to long term, however, the indirect impacts of climate change – e.g. changes in the availability of food, shelter and water, decreased mental health and well-being and changes in the distribution and seasonality of infectious diseases – are likely to grow in importance. The potentially catastrophic consequences of climate change can only be avoided if all countries work together towards a substantial reduction in the emission of so-called greenhouse gases and a substantial increase in the global population’s resilience to the risks of climate variability and change.
386;Climate change and eHealth: a promising strategy for health sector mitigation and adaptation;Climate change is one of today's most pressing global issues. Policies to guide mitigation and adaptation are needed to avoid the devastating impacts of climate change. The health sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions in developed countries, and its climate impact in low-income countries is growing steadily. This paper reviews and discusses the literature regarding health sector mitigation potential, known and hypothetical co-benefits, and the potential of health information technology, such as eHealth, in climate change mitigation and adaptation. The promising role of eHealth as an adaptation strategy to reduce societal vulnerability to climate change, and the link's between mitigation and adaptation, are also discussed. The topic of environmental eHealth has gained little attention to date, despite its potential to contribute to more sustainable and green health care. A growing number of local and global initiatives on ‘green information and communication technology (ICT)’ are now mentioning eHealth as a promising technology with the potential to reduce emission rates from ICT use. However, the embracing of eHealth is slow because of limitations in technological infrastructure, capacity and political will. Further research on potential emissions reductions and co-benefits with green ICT, in terms of health outcomes and economic effectiveness, would be valuable to guide development and implementation of eHealth in health sector mitigation and adaptation policies.
387;An Ill Wind? Climate Change, Migration, and Health;Background: Climate change is projected to cause substantial increases in population movement in coming decades. Previous research has considered the likely causal influences and magnitude of such movements and the risks to national and international security. There has been little research on the consequences of climate-related migration and the health of people who move. Objectives: In this review, we explore the role that health impacts of climate change may play in population movements and then examine the health implications of three types of movements likely to be induced by climate change: forcible displacement by climate impacts, resettlement schemes, and migration as an adaptive response. Methods: This risk assessment draws on research into the health of refugees, migrants, and people in resettlement schemes as analogs of the likely health consequences of climate-related migration. Some account is taken of the possible modulation of those health risks by climate change. Discussion: Climate-change–related migration is likely to result in adverse health outcomes, both for displaced and for host populations, particularly in situations of forced migration. However, where migration and other mobility are used as adaptive strategies, health risks are likely to be minimized, and in some cases there will be health gains. Conclusions: Purposeful and timely policy interventions can facilitate the mobility of people, enhance well-being, and maximize social and economic development in both places of origin and places of destination. Nevertheless, the anticipated occurrence of substantial relocation of groups and communities will underscore the fundamental seriousness of human-induced climate change.
388;Climate Change, Drought and Human Health in Canada;Droughts have been recorded all across Canada and have had significant impacts on individuals and communities. With climate change, projections suggest an increasing risk of drought in Canada, particularly in the south and interior. However, there has been little research on the impacts of drought on human health and the implications of a changing climate. A review of the Canadian, U.S. and international literature relevant to the Canadian context was conducted to better define these impacts and adaptations available to protect health. Drought can impact respiratory health, mental health, illnesses related to exposure to toxins, food/water security, rates of injury and infectious diseases (including food-, water- and vector-borne diseases). A range of direct and indirect adaptation (e.g., agricultural adaptation) options exist to cope with drought. Many have already been employed by public health officials, such as communicable disease monitoring and surveillance and public education and outreach. However, gaps exist in our understanding of the impacts of short-term vs. prolonged drought on the health of Canadians, projections of drought and its characteristics at the regional level and the effectiveness of current adaptations. Further research will be critical to inform adaptation planning to reduce future drought-related risks to health.
389;Mental health effects of climate change;We all know that 2014 has been declared as the hottest year globally by the Meteorological department of United States of America. Climate change is a global challenge which is likely to affect the mankind in substantial ways. Not only climate change is expected to affect physical health, it is also likely to affect mental health. Increasing ambient temperatures is likely to increase rates of aggression and violent suicides, while prolonged droughts due to climate change can lead to more number of farmer suicides. Droughts otherwise can lead to impaired mental health and stress. Increased frequency of disasters with climate change can lead to posttraumatic stress disorder, adjustment disorder, and depression. Changes in climate and global warming may require population to migrate, which can lead to acculturation stress. It can also lead to increased rates of physical illnesses, which secondarily would be associated with psychological distress. The possible effects of mitigation measures on mental health are also discussed. The paper concludes with a discussion of what can and should be done to tackle the expected mental health issues consequent to climate change.
390;Climate Change Impacts on Global Food Security;Climate change could potentially interrupt progress toward a world without hunger. A robust and coherent global pattern is discernible of the impacts of climate change on crop productivity that could have consequences for food availability. The stability of whole food systems may be at risk under climate change because of short-term variability in supply. However, the potential impact is less clear at regional scales, but it is likely that climate variability and change will exacerbate food insecurity in areas currently vulnerable to hunger and undernutrition. Likewise, it can be anticipated that food access and utilization will be affected indirectly via collateral effects on household and individual incomes, and food utilization could be impaired by loss of access to drinking water and damage to health. The evidence supports the need for considerable investment in adaptation and mitigation actions toward a “climate-smart food system” that is more resilient to climate change influences on food security.
391;Climate Change and Food Security: Health Impacts in Developed Countries;Background: Anthropogenic climate change will affect global food production, with uncertain consequences for human health in developed countries. Objectives: We investigated the potential impact of climate change on food security (nutrition and food safety) and the implications for human health in developed countries. Methods: Expert input and structured literature searches were conducted and synthesized to produce overall assessments of the likely impacts of climate change on global food production and recommendations for future research and policy changes. Results: Increasing food prices may lower the nutritional quality of dietary intakes, exacerbate obesity, and amplify health inequalities. Altered conditions for food production may result in emerging pathogens, new crop and livestock species, and altered use of pesticides and veterinary medicines, and affect the main transfer mechanisms through which contaminants move from the environment into food. All these have implications for food safety and the nutritional content of food. Climate change mitigation may increase consumption of foods whose production reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Impacts may include reduced red meat consumption (with positive effects on saturated fat, but negative impacts on zinc and iron intake) and reduced winter fruit and vegetable consumption. Developed countries have complex structures in place that may be used to adapt to the food safety consequences of climate change, although their effectiveness will vary between countries, and the ability to respond to nutritional challenges is less certain. Conclusions: Climate change will have notable impacts upon nutrition and food safety in developed countries, but further research is necessary to accurately quantify these impacts. Uncertainty about future impacts, coupled with evidence that climate change may lead to more variable food quality, emphasizes the need to maintain and strengthen existing structures and policies to regulate food production, monitor food quality and safety, and respond to nutritional and safety issues that arise.
392;Climate change, indoor environments, and health.;For many of us working in the indoor air sciences, it is clear that climate change has implications to buildings beyond modifying cooling and heating demands. Thus, it is surprising that in the world of climate science and policy, so little is said about how extreme weather events and long-term climate conditions might affect health through modification of indoor environments. Even in the most recent Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report (IPCC, 2007a), there is only brief reference to indoor health risk in terms of occupational heat stress and possible co-benefits of reducing biomass fuel use. The health concerns that climate scientists have focused on include ecosystem disruption and zoopathogens, toxic algal blooms, vector-borne diseases, heat stress, crop losses, and diminished nutritional value of food. Meanwhile, the indoor environment, until recently, has not been considered. The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) asked the Institute of Medicine (IOM) of the National Academy of Sciences to convene an expert committee to summarize the current state of scientific understanding of the effects of climate change on indoor air and public health and to identify priorities for action. The committee, which I chaired, included members with expertise in climate science, aerosol physics, architecture, mycology, medicine, infectious diseases, exposure assessment, and epidemiology. Table 1 lists the committee members. The committee was greatly aided by EPA-commissioned white papers (http://www.epa.gov/ iaq/pubs/index.html) and by workshops held in Washington, DC, and Berkeley, CA, where we heard from indoor air and building scientists, physiologists, and insurance risk assessors. The specific topic of climate change and indoor environments is so new that our insights have to be gleaned from what is already known about building conditions and occupant behaviors and from inferred responses to environmental conditions that might result from the perturbed climate that nature has in store for us. However, this limitation does not mean that little can be said about the implications of climate stresses on infrastructure. Relying substantially on synthesis from a large body of information on building conditions that lead to discomfort, degraded health, and lost productivity, the committee recognized that indoor environmental conditions already pose considerable health risk and that a warmer atmosphere with increased outdoor air pollution, forest fires, pollen and dust, heat waves, excessive rainfall, droughts, and the longer-term aberrations of regional climates would impact building performance and occupant health. Several scenarios can be envisioned in which climate change and weather extremes might impact buildings. Pollution and pollen, which are expected to increase, can penetrate indoors. Once indoors, reactive air pollutants like ozone can undergo further reactions. Building elements and furnishings can become wet and lead to mold growth or infestations. Building envelopes can become hotter during heat waves, adding to thermal stress. Changes in the atmospheric conditions over time will challenge building HVAC systems currently designed to manage contaminants and meet thermal comfort expectations that are based on the past 30 years of weather records. Figure 1 displays some of the possible pathways by which weather changes could influence the health of building occupants. We cannot blame all potentially adverse outcomes on weather alone. Actions are being taken to reduce greenhouse gas emissions through energy reduction by promoting high-efficiency building designs, renovations, and operation. Buildings are being audited (via
393;Forecasting the impacts of chemical pollution and climate change interactions on the health of wildlife.;"Global climate change is impacting organisms, biological communities and ecosystems around the world. While most research has focused on characterizing how the climate is changing, including modeling future climatic conditions and predicting the impacts of these conditions on biodiversity, it is also the case that climate change is altering the environmental impacts of chemical pollution. Future climate conditions are expected to influence both the worldwide distribution of chemicals and the toxi- cological consequences of chemical exposures to organisms. Many of the environmental changes associated with a warming global climate (e.g., increased average - and possibly extreme - temperatures; intense periods of drier and wetter conditions; reduced ocean pH; altered salinity dynamics in estuaries) have the potential to enhance organism susceptibility to chemical toxicity. Addi- tionally, chemical exposures themselves may impair the ability of organisms to cope with the changing environmental conditions of the shifting climate. Such reciprocity in the interactions between climate change and chemicals illustrates the complexity inherent in predicting the toxicological consequences of chemical exposures under future climate scenarios. Here, we summarize what is currently known about the potential reciprocal effects of climate change and chemical toxicity on wildlife, and depict current ap- proaches and ongoing challenges for incorporating climate effects into chemical testing and assessment. Given the rapid pace of new man-made chemistries, the development of accurate and rapid methods to evaluate multiple chemical and non-chemical stressors in an ecologically relevant context will be critical to understanding toxic and endocrine-disrupting effects of chemical pollutants under future climate scenarios (Current Zoology 61 (4): 669-689, 2015)."
394;Climate Change and Children’s Health—A Call for Research on What Works to Protect Children;"Climate change is affecting and will increasingly influence human health and wellbeing. Children are particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. An extensive literature review regarding the impact of climate change on children’s health was conducted in April 2012 by searching electronic databases PubMed, Scopus, ProQuest, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science, as well as relevant websites, such as IPCC and WHO. Climate change affects children’s health through increased air pollution, more weather-related disasters, more frequent and intense heat waves, decreased water quality and quantity, food shortage and greater exposure to toxicants. As a result, children experience greater risk of mental disorders, malnutrition, infectious diseases, allergic diseases and respiratory diseases. Mitigation measures like reducing carbon pollution emissions, and adaptation measures such as early warning systems and post-disaster counseling are strongly needed. Future health research directions should focus on: (1) identifying whether climate change impacts on children will be modified by gender, age and socioeconomic status; (2) refining outcome measures of children’s vulnerability to climate change; (3) projecting children’s disease burden under climate change scenarios; (4) exploring children’s disease burden related to climate change in low-income countries; and (5) identifying the most cost-effective mitigation and adaptation actions from a children’s health perspective."
395;Impact of climate change on biodiversity and associated key ecosystem services in Africa: a systematic review;ABSTRACT Introduction: Biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystems services are intrinsically dependent on the climate. During the twentieth century, climate change has posed major threats to biodiversity in Africa, and impacts are expected to increase as climate change continues and perhaps even accelerates.Outcomes: Our review shows that the multiple components of climate change are projected to affect all levels of biodiversity, from genes over species to biome level. Loss of biodiversity as a result of climate change can alter the structures and functions of African ecological systems. As a result, the provision of biodiversity-based ecosystem services and the well-being of people that rely on these services are being modified. Of particular concerns are “tipping points” where the exceedance of ecosystem thresholds will possibly lead to irreversible shifts of the structure of ecosystems and their services. In recent years, climate prediction models have portended continued warming and more frequent extreme weather events across the region. Such weather-related disturbances such as El Niño will place a premium on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem services that people rely on.Conclusion: As biodiversity underlies all goods and services provided by ecosystems that are crucial for human survival and well-being, this paper synthesizes and discusses observed and anticipated impacts of climate change on biodiversity and biodiversity-based ecosystem service provision and livelihoods, and what strategies might be employed to decrease current and future risks on the well-being of human in Africa.
396;The geographic distribution and economic value of climate change-related ozone health impacts in the United States in 2030;In this United States-focused analysis we use outputs from two general circulation models (GCMs) driven by different greenhouse gas forcing scenarios as inputs to regional climate and chemical transport models to investigate potential changes in near-term U.S. air quality due to climate change. We conduct multiyear simulations to account for interannual variability and characterize the near-term influence of a changing climate on tropospheric ozone-related health impacts near the year 2030, which is a policy-relevant time frame that is subject to fewer uncertainties than other approaches employed in the literature. We adopt a 2030 emissions inventory that accounts for fully implementing anthropogenic emissions controls required by federal, state, and/or local policies, which is projected to strongly influence future ozone levels. We quantify a comprehensive suite of ozone-related mortality and morbidity impacts including emergency department visits, hospital admissions, acute respiratory symptoms, and lost school days, and estimate the economic value of these impacts. Both GCMs project average daily maximum temperature to increase by 1–4°C and 1–5 ppb increases in daily 8-hr maximum ozone at 2030, though each climate scenario produces ozone levels that vary greatly over space and time. We estimate tens to thousands of additional ozone-related premature deaths and illnesses per year for these two scenarios and calculate an economic burden of these health outcomes of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of U.S. dollars (2010$). Implications: Near-term changes to the climate have the potential to greatly affect ground-level ozone. Using a 2030 emission inventory with regional climate fields downscaled from two general circulation models, we project mean temperature increases of 1 to 4°C and climate-driven mean daily 8-hr maximum ozone increases of 1–5 ppb, though each climate scenario produces ozone levels that vary significantly over space and time. These increased ozone levels are estimated to result in tens to thousands of ozone-related premature deaths and illnesses per year and an economic burden of hundreds of millions to tens of billions of U.S. dollars (2010$).
397;Vulnerable Populations Perceive Their Health as at Risk from Climate Change;"Climate change is already taking a toll on human health, a toll that is likely to increase in coming decades. The relationship between risk perceptions and vulnerability to climate change’s health threats has received little attention, even though an understanding of the dynamics of adaptation among particularly susceptible populations is becoming increasingly important. We demonstrate that some people whose health will suffer the greatest harms from climate change—due to social vulnerability, health susceptibility, and exposure to hazards—already feel they are at risk. In a 2013 survey we measured Maryland residents’ climate beliefs, health risk perceptions, and household social vulnerability characteristics, including medical conditions (n = 2126). We paired survey responses with secondary data sources for residence in a floodplain and/or urban heat island to predict perceptions of personal and household climate health risk. General health risk perceptions, political ideology, and climate beliefs are the strongest predictors. Yet, people in households with the following characteristics also see themselves at higher risk: members with one or more medical conditions or disabilities; low income; racial/ethnic minorities; and residence in a floodplain. In light of these results, climate health communication among vulnerable populations should emphasize protective actions instead of risk messages."
398;Households' perception of climate change and human health risks: A community perspective;BackgroundBangladesh has been identified as one of the most vulnerable countries in the world concerning the adverse effects of climate change (CC). However, little is known about the perception of CC from the community, which is important for developing adaptation strategies.MethodsThe study was a cross-sectional survey of respondents from two villages--one from the northern part and the other from the southern part of Bangladesh. A total of 450 households were selected randomly through multistage sampling completed a semi-structure questionnaire. This was supplemented with 12 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 15 key informant interviews (KIIs).ResultsOver 95 percent of the respondents reported that the heat during the summers had increased and 80.2 percent reported that rainfall had decreased, compared to their previous experiences. Approximately 65 percent reported that winters were warmer than in previous years but they still experienced very erratic and severe cold during the winter for about 5-7 days, which restricted their activities with very destructive effect on agricultural production, everyday life and the health of people. FGDs and KIIs also reported that overall winters were warmer. Eighty point two percent, 72.5 percent and 54.7 percent survey respondents perceived that the frequency of water, heat and cold related diseases/health problems, respectively, had increased compared to five to ten years ago. FGDs and KIIs respondents were also reported the same.ConclusionsRespondents had clear perceptions about changes in heat, cold and rainfall that had occurred over the last five to ten years. Local perceptions of climate variability (CV) included increased heat, overall warmer winters, reduced rainfall and fewer floods. The effects of CV were mostly negative in terms of means of living, human health, agriculture and overall livelihoods. Most local perceptions on CV are consistent with the evidence regarding the vulnerability of Bangladesh to CC. Such findings can be used to formulate appropriate sector programs and interventions. The systematic collection of such information will allow scientists, researchers and policy makers to design and implement appropriate adaptation strategies for CC in countries that are especially vulnerable.
399;Public Health Adaptation to Climate Change in Canadian Jurisdictions;Climate change poses numerous risks to the health of Canadians. Extreme weather events, poor air quality, and food insecurity in northern regions are likely to increase along with the increasing incidence and range of infectious diseases. In this study we identify and characterize Canadian federal, provincial, territorial and municipal adaptation to these health risks based on publically available information. Federal health adaptation initiatives emphasize capacity building and gathering information to address general health, infectious disease and heat-related risks. Provincial and territorial adaptation is varied. Quebec is a leader in climate change adaptation, having a notably higher number of adaptation initiatives reported, addressing almost all risks posed by climate change in the province, and having implemented various adaptation types. Meanwhile, all other Canadian provinces and territories are in the early stages of health adaptation. Based on publically available information, reported adaptation also varies greatly by municipality. The six sampled Canadian regional health authorities (or equivalent) are not reporting any adaptation initiatives. We also find little relationship between the number of initiatives reported in the six sampled municipalities and their provinces, suggesting that municipalities are adapting (or not adapting) autonomously.
400;Climate change and natural disasters – integrating science and practice to protect health;Background: Hydro-meteorological disasters are the focus of this paper. The authors examine, to which extent climate change increases their frequency and intensity. Methods: Review of IPCC-projections of climate-change related extreme weather events and related literature on health effects. Results: Projections show that climate change is likely to increase the frequency, intensity, duration, and spatial distribution of a range of extreme weather events over coming decades. Conclusions: There is a need for strengthened collaboration between climate scientists, the health researchers and policy-makers as well as the disaster community to jointly develop adaptation strategies to protect human.
401;Vulnerability assessment of mangroves to climate change and sea-level rise impacts;Climate change, particularly its associated sea level rise, is major threat to mangrove coastal areas, and it is essential to develop ways to reduce vulnerability through strategic management planning. Vulnerability has three dimensions of exposure to stresses, associated sensitivity, and related adaptive capacity, and ways to measure components of each were trialled at sites in Africa and the South Pacific to develop an analysis procedure based on ranking. The approaches of the ranking system for vulnerability assessment of mangrove systems integrate biotic and abiotic factors along with human management components, using validated methods previously developed for other research questions. These include determining mangrove forest health, adjacent ecosystem resilience, the extent and effects of human impacts, and the environmental conditions of different mangrove settings. Results of the vulnerability assessment ranking using up to 20 measurements found all sites to have some components of vulnerability. Douala Estuary, Cameroon showed the highest vulnerability, owing to low tidal range, impacts from non-climate stressors, and evidence of moderate seaward edge retreat. Tikina Wai, Fiji showed inherent vulnerability owing to location on a subsiding coastline with a low tidal range, but this was offset by strong local community management capacity. Rufiji Delta, Tanzania showed inherent resilience owing to location on an uplifting coastline with a macrotidal range, but showed vulnerability from human impacts and lower local community management capacity. The most critical components to the vulnerability assessment were found to be exposure components of relative sea level trends and sediment supply, and sensitivity components of forest health, recent spatial changes and net accretion rates. The results provide a baseline against which to establish long-term ongoing monitoring, allowing continued assessment of the complex dynamics of climate change impacts, and providing an information base for strategic management decisions.
402;Water, Drought, Climate Change, and Conflict in Syria;AbstractThe devastating civil war that began in Syria in March 2011 is the result of complex interrelated factors. The focus of the conflict is regime change, but the triggers include a broad set of religious and sociopolitical factors, the erosion of the economic health of the country, a wave of political reform sweeping over the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and Levant region, and challenges associated with climate variability and change and the availability and use of freshwater. As described here, water and climatic conditions have played a direct role in the deterioration of Syria’s economic conditions. There is a long history of conflicts over water in these regions because of the natural water scarcity, the early development of irrigated agriculture, and complex religious and ethnic diversity. In recent years, there has been an increase in incidences of water-related violence around the world at the subnational level attributable to the role that water plays in development disputes and econom...
403;Impacts of Climate Change on Outdoor Workers and Their Safety: Some Research Priorities;The literature on the potential impacts of climate change on the health of outdoor workers has received limited attention as a whole, and in sub-Saharan African countries in particular. Yet, substantial numbers of workers are experiencing the health effects of elevated temperature, in combination with changes in precipitation patterns, climate extremes and the effects of air pollution, which have a potential impact on their safety and wellbeing. With increased temperatures within urban settlements and frequent heats waves, there has been a sudden rise in the occurrence of heat-related illness leading to higher levels of mortality, as well as other adverse health impacts. This paper discusses the impacts of extreme heat exposure and health concerns among outdoor workers, and the resultant impacts on their productivity and occupational safety in tropical developing countries with a focus on Sub-Saharan Africa, where there is a dearth of such studies. Aside from the direct effects caused by extreme heat exposure, other indirect health hazards associated with increasing heat among this group includes exposures to hazardous chemicals and other vector-borne diseases. In addition, reduced work capacity in heat-exposed jobs will continue to rise and hinder economic and social development in such countries. There is an urgent need for further studies around the health and economic impacts of climate change in the workplace, especially in tropical developing countries, which may guide the implementation of the measures needed to address the problem.
404;Climate Change Adaptation through the Water-Energy-Food Nexus in Southern Africa;Climate change is a complex and cross-cutting problem that needs an integrated and transformative systems approach to respond to the challenge. Current sectoral approaches to climate change adaptation initiatives often create imbalances and retard sustainable development. Regional and international literature on climate change adaptation opportunities and challenges applicable to southern Africa from a water-energy-food (WEF) nexus perspective was reviewed. Specifically, this review highlights climate change impacts on water, energy, and food resources in southern Africa, while exploring mitigation and adaptation opportunities. The review further recommends strategies to develop cross-sectoral sustainable measures aimed at building resilient communities. Regional WEF nexus related institutions and legal frameworks were also reviewed to relate the WEF nexus to policy. Southern Africa is witnessing an increased frequency and intensity in climate change-associated extreme weather events, causing water, food, and energy insecurity. A projected reduction of 20% in annual rainfall by 2080 in southern Africa will only increase the regional socio-economic challenges. This is exacerbating regional resource scarcities and vulnerabilities. It will also have direct and indirect impacts on nutrition, human well-being, and health. Reduced agricultural production, lack of access to clean water, sanitation, and clean, sustainable energy are the major areas of concern. The region is already experiencing an upsurge of vector borne diseases (malaria and dengue fever), and water and food-borne diseases (cholera and diarrhoea). What is clear is that climate change impacts are cross-sectoral and multidimensional, and therefore require cross-sectoral mitigation and adaptation approaches. In this regard, a well-coordinated and integrated WEF nexus approach offers opportunities to build resilient systems, harmonise interventions, and mitigate trade-offs and hence improve sustainability. This would be achieved through greater resource mobilisation and coordination, policy convergence across sectors, and targeting nexus points in the landscape. The WEF nexus approach has potential to increase the resilience of marginalised communities in southern Africa by contributing towards attaining the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, and 13).
405;The Effects of Climate Change on Cardiac Health;The earth's climate is changing and increasing ambient heat levels are emerging in large areas of the world. An important cause of this change is the anthropogenic emission of greenhouse gases. Climate changes have a variety of negative effects on health, including cardiac health. People with pre-existing medical conditions such as cardiovascular disease (including heart failure), people carrying out physically demanding work and the elderly are particularly vulnerable. This review evaluates the evidence base for the cardiac health consequences of climate conditions, with particular reference to increasing heat exposure, and it also explores the potential further implications.
406;Environmental education and the health professions: framing climate change as a health issue;The likelihood of adverse health impacts from climate change is high. Actions to reduce emissions, however, not only mitigate climate change but often have more immediate health co-benefits. One substantial co-benefit is gained through reductions of the high health costs of pollution from fossil fuel power stations, particularly coal. Evidence indicates that the combustion of coal for electricity is responsible for over 200,000 deaths globally per year. Reducing such deaths is a health co-benefit of greenhouse mitigation actions that promote renewable energy or energy efficiency. Together, health co-benefits of mitigation and the health risks of climate change strengthen the calls from climate action networks for cleaner energy production and for other initiatives to reduce greenhouse emissions. The purpose of this scholarly review is to highlight the value of reframing climate change as a health issue to environmental movements and to environmental education and environmental education research. The purpose is also to highlight the potential for further collaboration between formal and informal environmental educators/researchers and the health professions. Health professionals and health educators would bring new voices for climate action to public and policy discourse as well as facilitate mitigation in their organisations and communities.
407;Six climate change-related events in the United States accounted for about $14 billion in lost lives and health costs.;The future health costs associated with predicted climate change-related events such as hurricanes, heat waves, and floods are projected to be enormous. This article estimates the health costs associated with six climate change-related events that struck the United States between 2000 and 2009. The six case studies came from categories of climate change-related events projected to worsen with continued global warming-ozone pollution, heat waves, hurricanes, infectious disease outbreaks, river flooding, and wildfires. We estimate that the health costs exceeded $14 billion, with 95 percent due to the value of lives lost prematurely. Actual health care costs were an estimated $740 million. This reflects more than 760,000 encounters with the health care system. Our analysis provides scientists and policy makers with a methodology to use in estimating future health costs related to climate change and highlights the growing need for public health preparedness.
408;Climate Change and Rising Heat: Population Health Implications for Working People in Australia;The rapid rise in extreme heat events in Australia recently is already taking a health toll. Climate change scenarios predict increases in the frequency and intensity of extreme heat events in the future, and population health may be significantly compromised for people who cannot reduce their heat exposure. Exposure to extreme heat presents a health hazard to all who are physically active, particularly outdoor workers and indoor workers with minimal access to cooling systems while working. At air temperatures close to (or beyond) the core body temperature of 37°C, body cooling via sweating is essential, and this mechanism is hampered by high air humidity. Heat exposure among elite athletes and the military has been investigated, whereas the impacts on workers remain largely unexplored, particularly in relation to future climate change. Workers span all age groups and diverse levels of fitness and health status, including people with higher than “normal” sensitivity to heat. In a hotter world, workers are likely to experience more heat stress and find it increasingly difficult to maintain productivity. Modeling of future climate change in Australia shows a substantial increase in the number of very hot days (>35°C) across the country. In this article, the authors characterize the health risks associated with heat exposure on working people and discuss future exposure risks as temperatures rise. Progress toward developing occupational health and safety guidelines for heat in Australia are summarized.
409;Global expansion and redistribution of Aedes-borne virus transmission risk with climate change;"Forecasting the impacts of climate change on Aedes-borne viruses—especially dengue, chikungunya, and Zika—is a key component of public health preparedness. We apply an empirically parameterized Bayesian transmission model of Aedes-borne viruses for the two vectors Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus as a function of temperature to predict cumulative monthly global transmission risk in current climates, and compare with projected risk in 2050 and 2080 based on general circulation models (GCMs). Our results show that if mosquito range shifts track optimal temperatures for transmission (26-29 °C), we can expect poleward shifts in Aedes-borne virus distributions. However, the differing thermal niches of the two vectors produce different patterns of shifts under climate change. More severe climate change scenarios produce proportionally worse population exposures from Ae. aegypti, but not from Ae. albopictus in the most extreme cases. Expanding risk of transmission from both mosquitoes will likely be a serious problem, even in the short term, for most of Europe; but significant reductions are also expected for Aedes albopictus, most noticeably in southeast Asia and west Africa. Within the next century, nearly a billion people are threatened with new exposure to both Aedes spp. in the worst-case scenario; but massive net losses in risk are noticeable for Ae. albopictus, especially in terms of year-round transmission, marking a global shift towards more seasonal risk across regions. Many other complicating factors (like mosquito range limits and viral evolution) exist, but overall our results indicate that while climate change will lead to both increased and new exposures to vector-borne disease, the most extreme increases in Ae. albopictus transmission are predicted to occur at intermediate climate change scenarios. Author Summary: The established scientific consensus indicates that climate change will severely exacerbate the risk and burden of Aedes-transmitted viruses, including dengue, chikungunya, Zika, West Nile virus, and other significant threats to global health security. Here, we show that the story is more complicated, first and foremost due to differences between the more heat-tolerant Aedes aegypti and the more heat-limited Ae. albopictus. Almost a billion people could face their first exposure to viral transmission from either mosquito in the worst-case scenario, especially in Europe and high-elevation tropical and subtropical regions. On the other hand, while year-round transmission potential from Ae. aegypti is likely to expand (especially in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa), Ae. albopictus loses significant ground in the tropics, marking a global shift towards seasonal risk as the tropics eventually become too hot for transmission by Ae. albopictus. Complete mitigation of climate change to a pre-industrial baseline could protect almost a billion people from arbovirus range expansions; but middle-of-the-road mitigation may actually produce the greatest expansion in the potential for viral transmission by Ae. albopictus. In any scenario, mitigating climate change also shifts the burden of both dengue and chikungunya (and potentially other Aedes transmitted viruses) from higher-income regions back onto the tropics, where transmission might otherwise start to be curbed by rising temperatures."
410;Climate Change and Air Quality: The Potential Impact on Health;The objectives of the study were to: consider the potential health impacts in Australia and the region arising from changes in air quality occurring as a result of climate change, identify vulnerable groups and potential adaptation measures and discuss the implications for policy. The authors provide an overview of international and national information on the potential health impacts of air pollutants that would most likely be affected by climate change and a discussion of the policy implications. Climate change is likely to have an impact on levels of ozone and possibly particulates, both of which are associated with increased mortality and a range of respiratory and cardiovascular health effects. One of the implications is therefore a possible increase in adverse health effects due to air pollutants. Regional health impact assessments of climate change should address the issue of air quality, consider current coping capacity, and determine the need for adaptation, particularly for vulnerable groups. Implications for policy include the need for improved modeling and forecasting of air pollutant levels, increased efforts to reduce emissions of air pollutants, continued monitoring of air pollutant levels, and monitoring of the incidence of health effects associated with air pollutants in all countries in the region.
411;Environmental effects of ozone depletion, UV radiation and interactions with climate change: UNEP Environmental Effects Assessment Panel, update 2017;"The Environmental Effects Assessment Panel (EEAP) is one of three Panels of experts that inform the Parties to the Montreal Protocol. The EEAP focuses on the effects of UV radiation on human health, terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, air quality, and materials, as well as on the interactive effects of UV radiation and global climate change. When considering the effects of climate change, it has become clear that processes resulting in changes in stratospheric ozone are more complex than previously held. Because of the Montreal Protocol, there are now indications of the beginnings of a recovery of stratospheric ozone, although the time required to reach levels like those before the 1960s is still uncertain, particularly as the effects of stratospheric ozone on climate change and vice versa , are not yet fully understood. Some regions will likely receive enhanced levels of UV radiation, while other areas will likely experience a reduction in UV radiation as ozone- and climate-driven changes affect the amounts of UV radiation reaching the Earth’s surface. Like the other Panels, the EEAP produces detailed Quadrennial Reports every four years; the most recent was published as a series of seven papers in 2015 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. , 2015, 14 ,1-184). In the years in between, the EEAP produces less detailed and shorter Update Reports of recent and relevant scientific findings. The most recent of these was for 2016 (Photochem. Photobiol. Sci. , 2017, 16 , 107-145). The present 2017 Update Report assesses some of the highlights and new insights about the interactive nature of the direct and indirect effects of UV radiation, atmospheric processes, and climate change. A full 2018 Quadrennial Assessment, will be made available in 2018/2019."
412;The gender perspective in climate change and global health;Background: Population health is a primary goal of sustainable development. United Nations international conferences like the Beijing Platform for Action have highlighted the key role of women in ensuring sustainable development. In the context of climate change, women are affected the most while they display knowledge and skills to orient themselves toward climate adaptation activities within their societies. Objective: To investigate how the gender perspective is addressed as an issue in research and policy-making concerning climate change and global health. Methods: A broad literature search was undertaken using the databases Pubmed and Web of Science to explore the terms ‘climate change,’ ‘health,’ ‘gender,’ and ‘policy.’ Climate change and health-related policy documents of the World Health Organization (WHO) and National Communications and National Adaptation Programs of Action reports submitted to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change of selected countries were studied. Assessment guidelines to review these reports were developed from this study's viewpoint. Results: The database search results showed almost no articles when the four terms were searched together. The WHO documents lacked a gender perspective in their approach and future recommendations on climate policies. The reviewed UN reports were also neutral to gender perspective except one of the studied documents. Conclusion: Despite recognizing the differential effects of climate change on health of women and men as a consequence of complex social contexts and adaptive capacities, the study finds gender to be an underrepresented or non-existing variable both in research and studied policy documents in the field of climate change and health.
413;Assessment of awareness regarding climate change and its health hazards among the medical students;Background: Climate change has emerged as one of the most devastating environmental threat and there is overwhelming evidence of wide range of implications for human health. To mitigate this, well-prepared medical man power is required. Objectives: The objectives of this study were (1) to assess the awareness regarding climate change and its health hazards among the medical students and (2) to recommend the awareness campaigns regarding climate change and its health hazards for students based on the results. Settings and Design: This observational study was conducted at the Medical College in Pune city. Materials and Methods: Medical students from all years of M.B.B.S. (Bachelor of Medicine and Bachelor of Surgery) who had given the written consent were included in this study. A self-administered, pre-tested, questionnaire was used. Responses were evaluated. Statistical Analysis Used: Proportions, percentage, and Chi-square test. Results: A total of 250 medical students were included in this study. In all, 246 (98.40%) students commented that global climate is changing, while 245 (98%) students opined that human activities are contributing to climate change. The commonest source of information about climate change was newspaper and magazines (78.20%). Majority commented that deforestation and industrial and vehicular pollution contribute most to climate change. According to 47.50% of the students, health-related issues are priority for climate change prevention strategy. According to 65.10% students, direct physical hazards of extreme climatic events are most important health-related impact of climate change, followed by natural disaster-related health hazards (43.50%), waterborne diseases (27.60%), vector-borne diseases (17.60%), and malnutrition (10%). There was statistically significant difference found between year of MBBS of the students and the awareness regarding United Nations Federation on Climate Change, Kyoto protocol (χ2 = 7.85, P = 0.02), and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (χ2 = 12.77, P = 0.002). A significant difference was found between the awareness about health impact of climate change at different places (χ2 = 11.25, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Students had awareness regarding health hazards of the climate change, but improvement for mitigation is required. It is suggested that a large nation-wide awareness survey regarding climate change and its health hazards is necessary to determine the preparedness of medical students and also to suggest any changes in the current curriculum.
414;Climate change in context: putting people first in the Arctic;Climate change is a major challenge to Arctic and other Indigenous peoples, but not the only and often not the most pressing one. We propose re-framing the treatment of climate change in policy and research, to make sure health, poverty, education, cultural vitality, equity, justice, and other topics highlighted by the people themselves and not just climate science also get the attention they deserve in research on global and regional environmental change. Climate change can often exacerbate other problems, but a singular focus on climate change—as is often the case in much existing environmental literature on the Arctic and elsewhere—can distract from actions that can be taken now to improve the lives of Arctic peoples. The same logic also applies elsewhere in the world, where diverse residents face a host of challenges, opportunities, and obstacles, with climate change but one among many issues. Our proposed approach to regional and global environmental change research draws on the ideas of decolonization, emphasizing collaborative approaches and Indigenous voices in research and policy instead of top-down measures designed outside the affected communities. Only in this way of contextualizing human-environmental experiences can the full effects of climate change be understood—and appropriate responses developed and carried out to adapt to global change.
415;Climate Change Adaptation at the Intersection of Food and Health;Nutritious, safe, affordable, and enjoyable food is a fundamental prerequisite for health. As a nation, Australia is currently classified as food secure with the domestic production exceeding domestic consumption of most major food groups. The domestic system is almost self-sufficient in terms of nutritious plant foods, although these foods have seen steady higher price increases relative to other foods, with nutrition equity implications. However, the viability of Australia’s food security sits counter to the continued presence of a stable and supportive climate. This article reviews the current state of science concerning the interface between climate change, food systems, and human health to reveal the key issues that must be addressed if Australia is to advance human health and sustainable food systems under a changing climate.
416;Climate Change and Farmers’ Mental Health: Risks and Responses;Climate change is exacerbating climate variability, evident in more frequent and severe weather-related disasters, such as droughts, fires, and floods. Most of what is known about the possible effects of climate change on rural mental health relates to prolonged drought. But though drought is known to be a disproportionate and general stressor, evidence is mixed and inconclusive. Over time, like drought other weather-related disasters may erode the social and economic bases on which farming communities depend. Rural vulnerability to mental health problems is greatly increased by socioeconomic disadvantage. Related factors may compound this, such as reduced access to health services as communities decline and a “stoical” culture that inhibits help-seeking. Australia has the world’s most variable climate and is a major global agricultural producer. Yet despite Australia’s (and, especially, rural communities’) dependence on farmers’ well-being and success, there is very little—and inconclusive—quantitative evidence about farmers’ mental health. The aim of this review is to consider, with a view to informing other countries, how climate change and related factors may affect farmers’ mental health in Australia. That information is a prerequisite to identifying, selecting, and evaluating adaptive strategies, to lessen the risks of adverse mental health outcomes. The authors identify the need for a systematic epidemiology of the mental health of farmers facing increasing climate change— related weather adversity.
417;It's Time for Medical Schools to Introduce Climate Change Into Their Curricula.;Climate change presents unprecedented health risks and demands universal attention to address them. Multiple intergovernmental organizations, health associations, and health professions schools have recognized the specific importance of preparing physicians to address the health impacts of climate change. However, medical school curricula have not kept pace with this urgent need for targeted training.The authors describe the rationale for inclusion of climate change in medical education and some potential pathways for incorporating this broad topic into physician training and continuing medical education. Reasons include the magnitude and reach of this transboundary issue, the shared responsibility of the U.S. health care sector as a major contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and the disproportionate effects of climate change on vulnerable populations. The integration of climate-change-related topics with training of essential physician skills in a rapidly changing environment is feasible because many health topic areas already exist in medical school curricula in which climate change education can be incorporated. To fully integrate the health topics, underlying concepts, and the needed clinical and system-wide translations, content could be included across the scope of training and into continuing medical education and faculty development. The authors provide examples of such an approach to curricular inclusion.
418;Farmer Health and Adaptive Capacity in the Face of Climate Change and Variability. Part 2: Contexts, Personal Attributes and Behaviors;This study extends the emerging body of research on farmer adaptation to climate change, by segmenting farmers on the basis of specific attributes (health, values, belief about climate change, sense of responsibility for climate change, desire to change, social, human and financial capitals and farmer demographics) and considering such attributes as critical social aspects of the contextualized capacity to adapt. The segmental analysis was based on a nationally representative sample of 3,993 farmers concerned with farmer adaptation of climate risks. The resulting data were subjected to two-step cluster analysis to identify homogenous groups of farmers based on factors related to climate change adaptation. A three-cluster solution was identified wherein farmers were distinguishable on the basis of belief in climate change, desire for financial assistance and advice, social connectedness, information seeking, and adverse farm conditions. The largest group (Cluster 1: 55%) was characterized by farmers who recognized being affected by drought and drying and who were actively engaged in adaptive practices, despite the fact that they had little income and poor farm resources. One third of these farmers reported that their health was a barrier to sustained activity in farming. Cluster 2 (26%) was characterized by farmers not readily affected by drying, who enjoyed good incomes, good health and better farming conditions. They expressed little desire to adapt. The smallest cluster (Cluster 3: 19%) was also characterized by farmers who recognized that they were affected by drying. However, despite a desire to adapt, they had very little means to do so. They reported the poorest natural resources and the poorest health, despite being younger. The findings suggest that it is the intent to adapt, starting from where people are at, which is a more important indicator of the capacity to work towards sustainable practices than assets tests alone.
419;Climate change and children's health;Purpose of review To present the latest data that demonstrate how climate change affects children's health and to identify the principal ways in which climate change puts children's health at risk. Recent findings Data continue to emerge that further implicate climate change as contributing to health burdens in children. Climate models have become even more sophisticated and consistently forecast that greenhouse gas emissions will lead to higher mean temperatures that promote more intense storms and droughts, both of which have profound implications for child health. Recent climate models shed light upon the spread of vector-borne disease, including Lyme disease in North America and malaria in Africa. Modeling studies have found that conditions conducive to forest fires, which generate harmful air pollutants and damage agriculture, are likely to become more prevalent in this century due to the effects of greenhouse gases added to earth's atmosphere. Summary Through many pathways, and in particular via placing additional stress upon the availability of food, clean air, and clean water and by potentially expanding the burden of disease from certain vector-borne diseases, climate change represents a major threat to child health. Pediatricians have already seen and will increasingly see the adverse health effects of climate change in their practices. Because of this, and many other reasons, pediatricians have a unique capacity to help resolve the climate change problem.
420;The influence of climate change on waterborne disease and Legionella: a review;"Climate change is predicted to have a major impact on people’s lives with the recent extreme weather events and varying abnormal temperature profiles across the world raising concerns. The impacts of global warming are already being observed, from rising sea levels and melting snow and ice to changing weather patterns. Scientists state unequivocally that these trends cannot be explained by natural variability in climate alone. Human activities, especially the burning of fossil fuels, have warmed the earth by dramatically increasing concentrations of heat-trapping gases in the atmosphere; as these concentrations increase, the more the earth will warm. Climate change and related extreme weather events are being exacerbated sooner than has previously been considered and are already adversely affecting ecosystems and human health by increasing the burden and type of disease at a local level. Changes to the marine environment and freshwater supplies already affect significant parts of the world’s population and warmer temperatures, especially in more temperate regions, may see an increased spread and transmission of diseases usually associated with warmer climes including, for example, cholera and malaria; these impacts are likely to become more severe in a greater number of countries. This review discusses the impacts of climate change including changes in infectious disease transmission, patterns of waterborne diseases and the likely consequences of climate change due to warmer water, drought, higher rainfall, rising sea levels and flooding."
421;Assessment of the Health Impacts of Climate Change in Kiribati;Kiribati—a low-lying, resource-poor Pacific atoll nation—is one of the most vulnerable countries in the World to the impacts of climate change, including the likely detrimental effects on human health. We describe the preparation of a climate change and health adaptation plan for Kiribati carried out by the World Health Organization and the Kiribati Ministry of Health and Medical Services, including an assessment of risks to health, sources of vulnerability and suggestions for highest priority adaptation responses. This paper identifies advantages and disadvantages in the process that was followed, lays out a future direction of climate change and health adaptation work in Kiribati, and proposes lessons that may be applicable to other small, developing island nations as they prepare for and adapt to the impacts of climate change on health.
422;Temperature-related mortality impacts under and beyond Paris Agreement climate change scenarios;The Paris Agreement binds all nations to undertake ambitious efforts to combat climate change, with the commitment to “hold warming well below 2 °C in global mean temperature (GMT), relative to pre-industrial levels, and to pursue efforts to limit warming to 1.5 °C”. The 1.5 °C limit constitutes an ambitious goal for which greater evidence on its benefits for health would help guide policy and potentially increase the motivation for action. Here we contribute to this gap with an assessment on the potential health benefits, in terms of reductions in temperature-related mortality, derived from the compliance to the agreed temperature targets, compared to more extreme warming scenarios. We performed a multi-region analysis in 451 locations in 23 countries with different climate zones, and evaluated changes in heat and cold-related mortality under scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement targets (1.5 and 2 °C) and more extreme GMT increases (3 and 4 °C), and under the assumption of no changes in demographic distribution and vulnerability. Our results suggest that limiting warming below 2 °C could prevent large increases in temperature-related mortality in most regions worldwide. The comparison between 1.5 and 2 °C is more complex and characterized by higher uncertainty, with geographical differences that indicate potential benefits limited to areas located in warmer climates, where direct climate change impacts will be more discernible.
423;A review of urban landscape adaptation to the challenge of climate change;Purpose Urban landscapes play a significant role in supporting municipal, ecological and social systems. Besides, valuable environmental services and urban green spaces provide social and psychological services, very important for the liveability of modern cities and the well-being of urban residents. It is clear that the area of green space in a city, the method of designing urban landscape and access to urban green space potentially affect the health, happiness, comfort, safety and security of urban dwellers. Urban landscape plays a significant role in providing habitats for wildlife, and an important vegetation type in doing this is species-rich herbaceous vegetation that provides pollen and nectar plus physical habitat for native fauna. Any factor that makes an impression on the urban landscape (such as climate change) will affect people’s lives directly or indirectly. There is a universal consensus that the temperature has increased in most of the world over the past century the investigation of climate change impacts on the urban landscape is the purpose of this study.   Findings Understanding the process of climate change adaptation is necessary to design plant communities for use in public landscapes. Increased CO2 and air temperature in conjunction with the changing rainfall conditions, as the three important factors of climate change, potentially alter almost all world ecosystems. Climate change provides new opportunities, and in some cases, an obligate need to use non-native plant species in conjunction with native plant species, not only to reduce the side effects of climate change but also to increase the species diversity and aesthetic value in meadow-like naturalistic planting design.   Originality/value The authors confirm that this work is original and has not been published elsewhere. In this paper, the authors report on the effects of climate change on urban landscape and suggest different kind of solutions to reduce the effects. The paper should be of interest to readers in the areas of landscape architecture, landscape ecologist, landscape planner, landscape managers and environmental designer.
424;Climate change, air pollution and noncommunicable diseases;"The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified climate change as one of the greatest health threats of the 21st century, and air pollution as the single largest environmental health risk.1 At the same time, noncommunicable diseases constitute the largest and fastest growing global health burden, with treatment costs placing a massive strain on government and individual resources. The scaling up of international commitment on noncommunicable diseases over the past decade had initially focused on four risk factors: tobacco use, the harmful use of alcohol, unhealthy diet and physical inactivity. Exposure to each of these risks has a strong element of personal choice, with the responsibility often placed on individual rather than on broader societal responses. However, these risks are also strongly affected by social determinants, including commodity prices, production methods, marketing and social norms, and in the case of activity levels, the physical environment. A range of other risk factors for noncommunicable diseases are even more strongly linked to environmental exposures – and to climate change. Therefore, together, climate change, air pollution and noncommunicable diseases represent one of the most serious threats to global health. Many of the same development patterns that lead to high reliance on fossil fuels, as well as policies and technological choices that are driving climate change (such as polluting transport and energy choices) are also worsening air pollution and other environmental exposures. These exposures have a direct and strong influence on the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases. The most obvious is air pollution. Indoor and outdoor air pollution is responsible for an estimated 7 million deaths a year2 and comes second to tobacco as a risk factor for noncommunicable diseases. Air pollution has therefore been identified as the fifth major risk factor in the latest political declaration of the United Nations General Assembly on the prevention and control of noncommunicable diseases. The effects of air pollution on health show that noncommunicable diseases are not exclusively due to lifestyle or personal choices, as is commonly perceived. Recommendations to stay indoors, avoid walking along particularly polluted streets or to wear facemasks during episodes of high exposure to air pollution illustrate the inadequacy of individual responses to a broad and serious problem. The ultimate causes of air pollution, and therefore of a large proportion of the noncommunicable disease burden, are the energy sources that currently drive our transport, electricity generation, industry and food production systems. The connection between the sources of local air pollution and the emissions that drive climate change is very clear. Estimations show that approximately 25% of urban ambient air pollution from fine particulate matter (PM2.5) is contributed by traffic, 15% by industrial activities including electricity generation, 20% by domestic fuel burning (with a remaining 22% from unspecified sources of human origin and 18% from natural sources).3 Exposure to indoor air pollution is mostly due to the use of solid fuels for cooking in low-income households.4 Such exposure causes almost 4 million deaths a year, of which almost 3 million are due to noncommunicable diseases such as lung cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, ischaemic heart disease and stroke. For comparison, the International Panel on Climate Change estimates that global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by transport (14%), energy; including generation of electricity and heat (35%), industry (21%), buildings (6%) and agriculture and land use change (24%).5 The sources of climate change and air pollution, and therefore a large part of the noncommunicable disease burden, are broadly the same: polluting energy systems. Some of the same pollutants contribute both to climate change and local ambient and household air pollution. Black carbon, produced by inefficient combustion in sources such as cookstoves and diesel engines, is the second greatest contributor to global warming after carbon dioxide.5 Black carbon is also a significant contributor (between 5% and 15%) of urban exposure to PM2.5. The second largest contributor to global warming is methane, which reacts with other pollutants to form ozone and is responsible for 230 000 chronic respiratory disease deaths globally each year.6 Both of these pollutants are short-lived in the atmosphere, meaning that targeting them for removal would have immediate beneficial effects on both climate change and noncommunicable diseases, such as stroke and deaths from cardiovascular disease. A set of 16 practical interventions, from replacing polluting cookstoves with cleaner household energy solutions, to replacing the most polluting diesel fuels and engines with less polluting ones, would prevent approximately 0.5°C of global warming, and save some 2.5 million lives a year by 2050.7 Other opportunities are available: improving energy efficiency and insulation in houses in temperate climates, therefore reducing mortality from respiratory and cardiovascular deaths in winter; transitioning from polluting solid fuels to clean and sustainable energy in low-income households, therefore reducing deaths from indoor air pollution; adopting reliable renewable energy in health-care facilities not connected to electricity grids, therefore allowing refrigeration of medical supplies and lighting for essential services.8 In the transport sector, an accelerated transition from diesel and petrol engines to electric powered vehicles would contribute to reducing emissions of local air pollutants and greenhouse gas. Much greater health gains, however, would result from replacing short urban car journeys with walking and cycling, Climate change, air pollution and noncommunicable diseases Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum & Annette Prüss-Ustün"
425;Climate change effects on human health: projections of temperature-related mortality for the UK during the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s;Background The most direct way in which climate change is expected to affect public health relates to changes in mortality rates associated with exposure to ambient temperature. Many countries worldwide experience annual heat-related and cold-related deaths associated with current weather patterns. Future changes in climate may alter such risks. Estimates of the likely future health impacts of such changes are needed to inform public health policy on climate change in the UK and elsewhere. Methods Time-series regression analysis was used to characterise current temperature-mortality relationships by region and age group. These were then applied to the local climate and population projections to estimate temperature-related deaths for the UK by the 2020s, 2050s and 2080s. Greater variability in future temperatures as well as changes in mean levels was modelled. Results A significantly raised risk of heat-related and cold-related mortality was observed in all regions. The elderly were most at risk. In the absence of any adaptation of the population, heat-related deaths would be expected to rise by around 257% by the 2050s from a current annual baseline of around 2000 deaths, and cold-related mortality would decline by 2% from a baseline of around 41 000 deaths. The cold burden remained higher than the heat burden in all periods. The increased number of future temperature-related deaths was partly driven by projected population growth and ageing. Conclusions Health protection from hot weather will become increasingly necessary, and measures to reduce cold impacts will also remain important in the UK. The demographic changes expected this century mean that the health protection of the elderly will be vital.
426;Risk perception and decision-making: do farmers consider risks from climate change?;Small-scale farmers are highly threatened by climate change. Experts often base their interventions to support farmers to adapt to climate change on their own perception of farmers’ livelihood risks. However, if differences in risk perception between farmers and experts exist, these interventions might fail. Thus, for effective design and implementation of adaptation strategies for farmers, it is necessary to understand farmers’ perception and how it influences their decision-making. We analyze farmers’ and experts’ systemic view on climate change threats in relation to other agricultural livelihood risks and assess the differences between their perceptions. For Cauca, Colombia, we found that experts and farmers perceived climate-related and other livelihood risks differently. While farmers’ perceived risks were a failure in crop production and lack of access to health and educational services, experts, in contrast, perceived insecurity and the unreliable weather to be the highest risks for farmers. On barriers that prevent farmers from taking action against risks, experts perceived both external factors such as the national policy and internal factors such as the adaptive capacity of farmers to be the main barriers. Farmers ranked the lack of information, especially about weather and climate, as their main barrier to adapt. Effective policies aiming at climate change adaptation need to relate climate change risks to other production risks as farmers often perceive climate change in the context of other risks. Policymakers in climate change need to consider differences in risk perception.
427;Climate change: The next challenge for public mental health?;Abstract Climate change is increasingly recognized as one of the greatest threats to human health of the 21st century, with consequences that mental health professionals are also likely to face. While physical health impacts have been increasingly emphasized in literature and practice, recent scholarly literature indicates that climate change and related weather events and environmental changes can profoundly impact psychological well-being and mental health through both direct and indirect pathways, particularly among those with pre-existing vulnerabilities or those living in ecologically sensitive areas. Although knowledge is still limited about the connections between climate change and mental health, evidence is indicating that impacts may be felt at both the individual and community levels, with mental health outcomes ranging from psychological distress, depression and anxiety, to increased addictions and suicide rates. Drawing on examples from diverse geographical areas, this article highlights some climate-sensitive impacts that may be encountered by mental health professionals. We then suggest potential avenues for public mental health in light of current and projected changes, in order to stimulate thought, debate, and action.
428;Natural and unnatural synergies: climate change policy and health equity.;Climate change and health inequities represent two of the greatest challenges to human development in the 21st century. As the Copenhagen summit on climate change planned for December 2009 approaches, there are opportuni-ties to use the political momentum of climate change to promote health equity. The broad-ranging policies re-quired to address climate change have both positive and negative implications for health and health equity.
429;Adapting to the effects of climate change on Inuit health.;Climate change will have far-reaching implications for Inuit health. Focusing on adaptation offers a proactive approach for managing climate-related health risks-one that views Inuit populations as active agents in planning and responding at household, community, and regional levels. Adaptation can direct attention to the root causes of climate vulnerability and emphasize the importance of traditional knowledge regarding environmental change and adaptive strategies. An evidence base on adaptation options and processes for Inuit regions is currently lacking, however, thus constraining climate policy development. In this article, we tackled this deficit, drawing upon our understanding of the determinants of health vulnerability to climate change in Canada to propose key considerations for adaptation decision-making in an Inuit context.
430;Climate change: allergens and allergic diseases;Climate change has been described as the biggest global health threat of the 21st century. The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases, such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide, have increased significantly since the start of the Industrial Era around 1750, with much of this increase occurring over just the last 50 years or so. This is resulting in warming of the climate system as well as changes in precipitation and weather and climate extremes. These changes in climate are having wide‐ranging impacts on the Earth’s physical, biological and human systems, including human health. It is these impacts of climate change on human health that are the focus of this paper, particularly the impacts on allergens and allergic diseases. Such impacts are particularly significant in many countries where the prevalence of such diseases is high and/or increasing. There is now compelling evidence that rising air temperatures and carbon dioxide concentrations are, in some plant species, resulting in increased pollen production and allergenicity and advancement and lengthening of the pollen season. Changes in extreme events, such as thunderstorms and tropical cyclones, will also have impacts on allergic diseases, with, for example, the flooding associated with tropical cyclones leading to proliferation of mould growth in damp homes. The article also considers a range of responses to these health threats, including greenhouse gas mitigation, and adaptation strategies, such as enhanced environmental monitoring and health surveillance and adequate planning for the future medical workforce.
431;Stern review on the economics of climate change: implications for Bangladesh;Purpose The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of climate change on economic development in Bangladesh. More specifically, the research aims to figure out the influence of climate change on gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate related to different sectors such as agriculture, forest, water, health and infrastructure. It also attempts to explore the effect of climate change on the coastal economy of Bangladesh.   Design/methodology/approach A set of statistical and econometric techniques, including descriptive and correlation analysis and time series regression model, was applied to address the objective of the research. Sector-wise time series economic data were collected from the World Bank for the period between 1971 and 2013. Climate data were received from the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Council online database for the period between 1948 and 2013.   Findings The results from the statistical analysis show that climate variables such as temperature and rainfall have changed between 1948 and 2013 in the context of Bangladesh. The econometric regression analysis demonstrates that an increase by 1°C of annual mean temperature leads to a decrease in the GDP growth rate by 0.44 per cent on average, which is statistically significant at the 5 per cent level. On the other hand, the estimated coefficients of agriculture, industry, services, urbanization and export are positively associated with GDP growth rate, and these are statistically significant at the 1 per cent level. Sector-wise correlation analysis provides statistical evidence that climate change is negatively associated with various sectors, such as agriculture, forest, human health and arable land. In contrast, it has a positive relation to water access and electricity consumption. Analysis of coastal regions shows that climate change negatively affects the local economic sectors of the coastal zone of the country.   Originality/value Although this study has received significant insight from the world-renowned research publication “The Economics of Climate Change: The Stern Review”, there is a dearth of research on the economic impact of climate change in the context of Bangladesh. The findings of the paper provide deep insight into and comprehensive views of policy makers on the impact of climate change on economic growth and various sectors in Bangladesh.
432;Climate Change and Human Health in China;"There is near unanimous scientific consensus that the world’s climate is changing and most of the warming is attributable to human activities. Over the past few decades, economic expansion of China, the largest developing country, has been one of the strongest in world history. Such an economic expansion, however, is largely driven by fossil fuels, which leads to dramatic increases in emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs). Although emissions per person in China are at the global average, China surpassed the United States as the country emitting the most carbon dioxide (CO2) in 2007 (International Energy Agency 2009). China is also a large emitter of methane and black carbon, the other two major contributors to global warming.    As in other parts of the world, China has experienced noticeable changes in climate over the past 100 years (National Development and Reform Commission 2007). The annual average air temperature has risen by 0.5–0.8°C, which is slightly higher than the average global temperature increase, and most of these changes have been observed over the past 50 years. Regional distribution of temperature changes shows that the warming trend was more significant in western, eastern, and northern China than in southern China. Seasonal distribution of the temperature changes shows that the most significant temperature increase occurred in winter. The trend of climate warming in China is projected to intensify in the future.    The Chinese government has paid great attention to climate change, but so far, there has been limited focus on climate-related the health impacts. Evidence is mounting that climate change has already affected human health directly and indirectly in China, including mortality from extreme weather events, changes in air and water quality, and changes in the ecology of infectious diseases (Zhang et al. 2010).    The observed relationship between temperature and daily mortality among Chinese residents has been generally J- or U-shaped, with mortality risk decreasing from the lowest temperature to an inflection point and then increasing with higher temperature (Kan et al. 2007). Heat waves and other extreme weather conditions have been associated with increased death risk in large Chinese cities, such as Beijing and Shanghai. Elevated mortality during temperature extremes has been attributed mainly to cardiovascular and respiratory diseases, especially among the elderly. However, little information is available in China on possible modifiers of the health impact of thermal extremes, such as preexisting health status and population demographics.    Improvement of living conditions resulting from rapid economic development in China can reduce heat wave–related heath impacts. In Shanghai, for example, heat waves in 1998 and 2003 both led to increased mortality. Although the heat waves in these 2 years were similar in meteorological characteristics, elevated mortality was much less pronounced during the 2003 event, suggesting that adaptations to climate change (e.g., increased use of air conditioners, larger living spaces, increased urban green space, higher levels of heat awareness, implementation of a heat warning system issued by local meteorological stations) can reduce health risks imposed on Chinese residents (Tan et al. 2007).    The health impacts of high temperatures and severe air pollution may interact and are thus worthy of attention, because outdoor air pollution is one of the major environmental challenges for public health in Chinese cities. In Wuhan, an “oven” city because of its hot summers, high temperatures enhanced the effect of particulate matter ≤ 10 μm (PM10) on cardiopulmonary mortality, even though PM10 concentrations were lower on days with extremely high temperatures than on days with normal and low temperatures (Qian et al. 2008). Also, levels of some secondary air pollutants, such as ozone, are affected by temperature and tend to be higher on hot days. Epidemiological evidence from Chinese cities has indicated significant risks of ozone associated with increasing temperatures (Zhang et al. 2006).    Climate change may lead to a wide range of extreme weather events in China, including typhoons, floods, blizzards, windstorms, drought, and landslides. The direct and indirect health effects due to these extreme events are important but are difficult to assess at present.    Climate change can also affect climate-sensitive infectious diseases carried by animal hosts or vectors; in China, these include schistosomiasis, Japanese encephalitis, Dengue fever, malaria, and Angiostrongylus cantonensis infection. For example, schistosomiasis is one of the vector-borne diseases that received little attention for many years, but the impact of climate change on its transmission has recently attracted attention and debate. In a recent study, Zhou et al. (2010) found that as winter temperatures continue to rise due to global warming, Oncomelania hupensis (the intermediate host of Schistosoma japonicum in China) may increase its range, thereby spreading schistosomiasis to the northern part of China.    China is striving to quadruple its gross domestic product (GDP) of the year 2000 by 2020, and consequently will face even more serious challenges in controlling emission of GHGs. The anthropogenic contribution to GHGs is largely caused by the same activity that causes air pollution, so if China acts to reduce the combustion of fossil fuels and the resultant air pollution, it will reap not only the health benefits associated with improvement of air quality but also the climate change benefits. Therefore, these air pollution–related health benefits might be a strong inducement for the Chinese government to act to combat climate change.    In short, there is sufficient evidence showing that climate change has posed health risks to Chinese populations. Future research will need to provide methods of adapting to climate change and evaluate the implementation of adaptation measures; improve characterization of climate–health relationships (particularly at regional levels); identify thresholds and particularly vulnerable groups; and collect and enhance long-term surveillance data on health issues of potential concern (including morbidity due to temperature extremes, vector-borne diseases, air quality, pollen and mold counts, food-borne and waterborne diseases, and mental health impacts from extreme weather events). Finally, GHG emissions need to be controlled. Concern about the health impacts of climate change can encourage the Chinese government to take appropriate action."
