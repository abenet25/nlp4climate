1;"""Climate change. Climate change is directly contributing to humanitarian emergencies from heatwaves, wildfires, floods, tropical storms and hurricanes and they are increasing in scale, frequency and intensity.
Research shows that 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year, from undernutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone.
The direct damage costs to health (excluding costs in health-determining sectors such as agriculture and water and sanitation) is estimated to be between US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030.
Areas with weak health infrastructure – mostly in developing countries – will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.
Reducing emissions of greenhouse gases through better transport, food and energy use choices can result in very large gains for health, particularly through reduced air pollution.
Climate change presents a fundamental threat to human health. It affects the physical environment as well as all aspects of both natural and human systems – including social and economic conditions and the functioning of health systems. It is therefore a threat multiplier, undermining and potentially reversing decades of health progress. As climatic conditions change, more frequent and intensifying weather and climate events are observed, including storms, extreme heat, floods, droughts and wildfires. These weather and climate hazards affect health both directly and indirectly, increasing the risk of deaths, noncommunicable diseases, the emergence and spread of infectious diseases, and health emergencies.
Climate change is also having an impact on our health workforce and infrastructure, reducing capacity to provide universal health coverage (UHC). More fundamentally, climate shocks and growing stresses such as changing temperature and precipitation patterns, drought, floods and rising sea levels degrade the environmental and social determinants of physical and mental health. All aspects of health are affected by climate change, from clean air, water and soil to food systems and livelihoods. Further delay in tackling climate change will increase health risks, undermine decades of improvements in global health, and contravene our collective commitments to ensure the human right to health for all.
The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6) concluded that climate risks are appearing faster and will become more severe sooner than previously expected, and it will be harder to adapt with increased global heating.
It further reveals that 3.6 billion people already live in areas highly susceptible to climate change. Despite contributing minimally to global emissions, low-income countries and small island developing states (SIDS) endure the harshest health impacts. In vulnerable regions, the death rate from extreme weather events in the last decade was 15 times higher than in less vulnerable ones.
Climate change is impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations, and those with underlying health conditions.
Figure: An overview of climate-sensitive health risks, their exposure pathways and vulnerability factors. Climate change impacts health both directly and indirectly, and is strongly mediated by environmental, social and public health determinants.
Although it is unequivocal that climate change affects human health, it remains challenging to accurately estimate the scale and impact of many climate-sensitive health risks. However, scientific advances progressively allow us to attribute an increase in morbidity and mortality to global warming, and more accurately determine the risks and scale of these health threats.
WHO data indicates 2 billion people lack safe drinking water and 600 million suffer from foodborne illnesses annually, with children under 5 bearing 30% of foodborne fatalities. Climate stressors heighten waterborne and foodborne disease risks. In 2020, 770 million faced hunger, predominantly in Africa and Asia. Climate change affects food availability, quality and diversity, exacerbating food and nutrition crises.
Temperature and precipitation changes enhance the spread of vector-borne diseases. Without preventive actions, deaths from such diseases, currently over 700 000 annually, may rise. Climate change induces both immediate mental health issues, like anxiety and post-traumatic stress, and long-term disorders due to factors like displacement and disrupted social cohesion.
Recent research attributes 37% of heat-related deaths to human-induced climate change. Heat-related deaths among those over 65 have risen by 70% in two decades. In 2020, 98 million more experienced food insecurity compared to the 1981–2010 average. The WHO conservatively projects 250 000 additional yearly deaths by the 2030s due to climate change impacts on diseases like malaria and coastal flooding. However, modelling challenges persist, especially around capturing risks like drought and migration pressures.
The climate crisis threatens to undo the last 50 years of progress in development, global health and poverty reduction, and to further widen existing health inequalities between and within populations. It severely jeopardizes the realization of UHC in various ways, including by compounding the existing burden of disease and by exacerbating existing barriers to accessing health services, often at the times when they are most needed. Over 930 million people – around 12% of the world’s population – spend at least 10% of their household budget to pay for health care. With the poorest people largely uninsured, health shocks and stresses already currently push around 100 million people into poverty every year, with the impacts of climate change worsening this trend.
In the short- to medium-term, the health impacts of climate change will be determined mainly by the vulnerability of populations, their resilience to the current rate of climate change and the extent and pace of adaptation. In the longer-term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points.
While no one is safe from these risks, the people whose health is being harmed first and worst by the climate crisis are the people who contribute least to its causes, and who are least able to protect themselves and their families against it: people in low-income and disadvantaged countries and communities.
Addressing climate change's health burden underscores the equity imperative: those most responsible for emissions should bear the highest mitigation and adaptation costs, emphasizing health equity and vulnerable group prioritization.
To avert catastrophic health impacts and prevent millions of climate change-related deaths, the world must limit temperature rise to 1.5°C. Past emissions have already made a certain level of global temperature rise and other changes to the climate inevitable. Global heating of even 1.5°C is not considered safe, however; every additional tenth of a degree of warming will take a serious toll on people’s lives and health.
WHO’s response to these challenges centres around 3 main objectives:
Promote actions that both reduce carbon emissions and improve health:
supporting a rapid and equitable transition to a clean energy economy; ensuring that health is central to climate change mitigation policy; accelerating mitigation actions that bring the greatest health gains; and mobilizing the strength of the health community to drive policy change and build public support.
Build better, more climate-resilient and environmentally sustainable health systems:
ensuring core services, environmental sustainability and climate resilience as central components of UHC and primary health care (PHC); supporting health systems to leapfrog to cheaper, more reliable and cleaner solutions, while decarbonizing high-emitting health systems; and mainstreaming climate resilience and environmental sustainability into health service investments, including the capacity of the health workforce.
Protect health from the wide range of impacts of climate change
: assessing health vulnerabilities and developing health plans; integrating climate risk and implementing climate-informed surveillance and response systems for key risks, such as extreme heat and infectious disease; supporting resilience and adaptation in health-determining sectors such as water and food; and closing the financing gap for health adaptation and resilience.
: WHO leads in emphasizing climate change's health implications, aiming to centralize health in climate policies, including through the UNFCCC. Partnering with major health agencies, health professionals and civil society, WHO strives to embed climate change in health priorities like UHC and target carbon neutrality by 2030.
: WHO, with its network of global experts, contributes global evidence summaries, provides assistance to nations in their assessments, and monitors progress. The emphasis is on deploying effective policies and enhancing access to knowledge and data.
: Through WHO offices, support is given to ministries of health, focusing on collaboration across sectors, updated guidance, hands-on training, and support for project preparation and execution as well as for securing climate and health funding.  WHO leads the
Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH)
, bringing together a range of health and development partners, to support countries in achieving their commitments to climate-resilient and low carbon health systems."""
2;""" Worldwide health risks related to climate change are on the rise. The big picture – how both environmental degradation and climate change harm health
1. Approximately 12.6 million deaths each year, is attributable to avoidable environmental risk factors. Climate change affects social and environmental determinants of health – clean air, safe drinking water, sufficient food and secure shelter- and exacerbate many of these risks
2. Climate change and environmental pollution – in particular air pollution - are closely connected. There are multiple solutions that address both or can be designed in a way to harness multiple benefits.
3. An estimated 6.5 million deaths are associated with air pollution every year.
Air pollution is a contributing factor in 1 in every 3 deaths from lung cancer, stroke or heart disease.
92% of people worldwide do not breathe clean air.
87% of deaths from outdoor air pollution occur in low- and middle-income countries.
2/3 of the premature deaths from air pollution are due to indoor smoke from indoor cooking fuels: 3 billion people cook and heat their homes using open fires or simple stoves, burning coal, or biomass
4. Climate change is projected to cause 250,000 additional deaths per year between 2030 and 2050 without mitigation and adaptation.
5. All populations will be affected by climate change, but some are more vulnerable than others. People living in small island developing states and other coastal regions, large cities, and mountainous and polar regions are particularly vulnerable.
6. Children – in particular, children living in poor countries – are among the most vulnerable to the resulting health risks and will be exposed longer to the health consequences. The health effects are also expected to be more severe for elderly people and people with infirmities or pre-existing medical conditions.
7. Areas with weak health infrastructure – mostly in developing countries – will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond. What is the impact of climate change on health?
damage costs to health from climate change is estimated to be between US$2-4 billion/year by 2030.
9. Extreme high air temperatures contribute directly to deaths from cardiovascular and respiratory disease, particularly among elderly people. In the heat wave of summer 2003 in Europe for example, more than 70 000 excess deaths were recorded. An estimated 125 million additional vulnerable adults were exposed to heatwaves between 2000 and 2016
. Pollen and other aeroallergen levels are also higher in extreme heat. These can trigger asthma, which affects around 300 million people.
10. Vector and waterborne diseases, such as malaria, dengue, cholera and other diarrhoeal diseases are already a leading health risk worldwide. Increasing temperatures and changing rainfall patterns facilitate transmission of vector-borne diseases. Rising freshwater (like lake surface) temperatures from climate change are likely to increase the prevalence of harmful algae, pathogens and bacteria. These can be a risk when those waters are used for recreation (swimming), drinking and potentially food (fish or agriculture).
        Actions needed: Health, Environment and Climate Change are intertwined
11. Despite evidence of the effect of environment and climate on health, political action and investments remain largely insufficient: only about 3% of health resources are invested in prevention, with approximately 97% spent on treatment, increasing healthcare costs.
12. A more preventive, integrated and intersectoral approach to enhancing health, fostering pro-poor growth, and protecting the environment, should promote policy coherence, more sustainable consumption, efficiency and equity. The healthcare community needs to mobilise at all levels, to gather data, act fast, and engage with the environment and climate change agenda for the good of a vast number of human lives:
Public Health Systems need to be strengthened to protect against climate change and enhance its capacity to manage emergencies for the benefit of individuals and communities, especially the less advantaged
Surveillance and Early Warning Systems can protect in advance of disaster striking
Solutions for Climate change, Environment and Health
13. Policies that reduce climate change and improve environmental conditions have huge health co-benefits potentials. For example, an increase of 7 per cent in total clean energy investment for the period 2012-2040 could prevent 1.7 million premature deaths from outdoor air pollution and 1.6 million deaths from household pollution in 2040
14. To avoid overshooting the Paris goals, governments (including by updating their Paris pledges), the private sector, cities and others need to urgently pursue actions that will bring deeper and more-rapid cuts. Technology investments in particularly in agriculture, buildings, energy, forestry, industry and transport sectors, at an investment cost of under $100 per tonne of CO
avoided, often much lower – could save up to 36 GtCO2e per year by 2030
, also contributing to tackle air pollution with benefits for human health and well-being.
15. The short life span of short-lived climate pollutants means that assertive action now to reduce emissions can rapidly improve air quality and save lives and contribute to food security, as well as slow the rate of near-term climate change by 0.6⁰C by mid-century.
16. Reducing emissions of both long-lived greenhouse gases and short-lived climate pollutants through better transport, better waste management, well-informed food, leisure and energy-use systems and resulting choices (e.g. clean cookstoves and heat stoves) can result in improved health, particularly through reduced air pollution.
to decarbonise our energy grids: decentralised renewables help improve access to modern energy systems and thereby reduce the need for polluting alternatives, from diesel generators to traditional biomass use
programmes reduce carbon emissions and air pollution, for the benefit of human health and well-being.
have a key role to play: if solar LED lanterns were used in place of kerosene and candles, they would displace 90 Mt of CO2 emissions while reducing indoor air pollution and significantly improving the health and safety of end users
sector is responsible for both near and long -term climate impacts and creates serious air, soil and water pollution, affecting human and animal health. Integrated waste management solutions can deliver 15 to 20% GHG emission reduction across the economy, reduce the impact of natural disasters and increase resilience. Almost half the waste generated worldwide is municipal solid waste. Reducing short-lived climate pollutants through well-managed waste systems will contribute to climate mitigation efforts and achieve health, environmental, and economic co-benefits, improving the quality of life of local communities.
: Urban planning has a critical role to play in reducing the need for transport and facilitating non-motorised and public transport options, efficiencies of buildings and energy systems, and harness the benefits from nature-based solutions, for cooling, cleaning the air and flood control etc:
Shifts towards more sustainable and greener

have passed resolutions at the World Health Assembly committing to mobilize the health sector to raise awareness and act on major environmental risks, including climate change, air pollution, water and sanitation, and chemical safety. They have adopted resolutions at UN Environment Assemblies to tackle air pollution and climate change and have mobilised Environment Ministers on the connections between environment and health. The 3rd session of the UN Environment Assembly to take place in Nairobi, Kenya (4-6 December) aims at paving the way “Towards a Pollution-Free Planet”. Join us and #Beatpollution.

3;"""Climate change is impacting human lives and health in a variety of ways. It threatens the essential ingredients of good health – clean air, safe drinking water, nutritious food supply and safe shelter – and has the potential to undermine decades of progress in global health.
Between 2030 and 2050, climate change is expected to cause approximately 250 000 additional deaths per year from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress alone. The direct damage costs to health are estimated to be between US$ 2–4 billion per year by 2030. Areas with weak health infrastructure – mostly in developing countries – will be the least able to cope without assistance to prepare and respond.
Greenhouse gas emissions that result from the extraction and burning of fossil fuels are major contributors to both climate
and air pollution. Many policies and individual measures, such as transport, food and energy use choices, have the potential to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce major health co-benefits, particularly by abating air pollution. The phase out of polluting energy systems, for example, or the promotion of public transportation and active movement, could both lower carbon emissions and cut the burden of household and ambient air pollution, which cause 7 million premature deaths per year
Climate change is already impacting health in a myriad of ways, including by leading to death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events, such as heatwaves, storms and floods, the disruption of food systems, increases in zoonoses and food-, water- and vector-borne diseases, and mental health issues. Furthermore, climate change is undermining many of the social determinants for good health, such as livelihoods, equality and access to health care and social support structures. These climate-sensitive health risks are disproportionately felt by the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including women, children, ethnic minorities, poor communities, migrants or displaced persons, older populations and those with underlying health conditions.

In the longer term, the effects will increasingly depend on the extent to which transformational action is taken now to reduce emissions and avoid the breaching of dangerous temperature thresholds and potential irreversible tipping points.
WHO supports countries in building climate-resilient health systems and tracking national progress in protecting health from climate change, as well as in assessing the health gains that would result from the implementation of the existing Nationally Determined Contributions to the Paris Agreement, and the potential for larger gains from more ambitious climate action.
WHO’s work plan on climate change and health includes:
advocacy and partnerships: coordinating with partner agencies within the UN system, and ensuring that health is properly represented in the climate change agenda, as well as providing and disseminating information on the threats that climate change presents to human health and opportunities to promote health while cutting carbon emissions;
monitoring science and evidence: coordinating reviews of the scientific evidence on the links between climate change and health; assessing country's preparedness and needs when facing climate change; and developing a global research agenda;
supporting countries to protect human health from climate change: strengthening national capacities and improving the resilience and adaptive capacity of health systems to deal with the adverse health effects of climate change; and
building capacity on climate change and human health: assisting countries to build capacity to reduce health vulnerability to climate change and promoting health while reducing carbon emissions."""
4;"""The summer of 2022 was the Region’s hottest on record, with northern and western Europe enduring extended periods of intense heatwaves. Low rainfall and soaring temperatures led to droughts and wildfires, resulting in crop damage and river depletion. The extreme heat caused over 15 000 excess heat-related deaths.
In July 2021, north-western Europe was exposed to devastating floods, primarily driven by heavy rainfall that was nine times more likely to happen because of climate change. With more than 230 victims, Belgium and Germany were the worst affected, but communities in Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland also suffered damage and loss.
In the last 50 years, the 1672 reported weather-related disasters in the Region have led to about 160 000 deaths, with an estimated economic loss of US$ 477 billion. The most-reported causes of disasters were floods (38%), and storms (32%), but extreme temperatures led to the highest proportion of disaster-related deaths (93%).
Climate change is projected to increase the number of days with high heat stress levels. The frequency, intensity and duration of heatwaves will increase further, seriously impacting public health in the Region. Heat-related mortality in the Region has increased by more than 30% during the past 20 years
The combined effects of climate change, urbanization and population ageing could substantially worsen heat-related impacts in the future.
The intensity and frequency of heavy rain and flood events are likely to increase in many areas throughout the Region. The areas of the Region under high water stress are estimated to increase from 19% in 2007 to 35% by the 2070s. By this time, the number of additional people affected is expected to reach 16–44 million.
Climate change continues to alter the distribution of disease vectors. Examples include ticks, which transmit tick-borne encephalitis and Lyme disease, and are now found at higher altitudes and latitudes; the tiger mosquito
, which is responsible for the transmission of several diseases, including dengue, chikungunya and Zika, and has expanded its distribution; and sand flies, which transmit leishmaniasis, and have shifted their distribution.
Climate change can also result in declining crop yields and, through the effect of increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide, reduced nutrient quality of crops, leading to increased malnutrition. Crop yields could decrease by 25–30% in central Asia and southern parts of Europe by the middle of the 21st century.
Climate change affects the health of people in the WHO European Region in a myriad of ways, including through death and illness from increasingly frequent extreme weather events (such as heatwaves, storms and floods); increases in zoonoses and food, water and vector-borne diseases; indirect impacts on air quality, food and water security; and mental health issues.
Climate change is set to become the most challenging threat populations face in the coming decades and needs to be tackled urgently. A significant increase in ill-health and premature deaths is projected due to climate change, with an additional 250 000 deaths per year worldwide by mid-century due to climate-sensitive diseases and conditions – and under high-emissions scenarios, over 9 million additional deaths per year by 2100.
In the European Region, temperatures have increased at more than twice the global average over the past years, the highest increase of any continent in the world. This change in the climate is causing significant harm to both natural and social systems, resulting in extensive and profound effects on health and well-being.
Adaptation and mitigation measures are necessary to address the burden of disease due to the current climate impacts and the additional burden posed by projected climate change. There is a need to strengthen mainstream public health and health services to bolster climate-resilient communities.
WHO, through its European Centre of Environment and Health (WHO ECEH) offers policy advice and provides technical support to build capacities in countries, including on climate change and health. In particular, it supports countries to:
integrate health considerations in climate mitigation and adaptation decision-making and policies;
develop health adaptation plans and heat–health action plans;
raise awareness on healthy climate policies in all sectors;
strengthen early warning, surveillance and preparedness systems for extreme weather events and disease outbreaks;
strengthen the climate resilience of health systems;
reduce greenhouse gas emissions in the health sector and improve environmental sustainability;
share knowledge, research and tools for evidence-informed policy-making.
WHO ECEH provides secretariat functions to the Working Group on Health in Climate Change (HIC), established under the European Environment and Health Task Force. The HIC supports Member States in implementing commitments made under the European Environment and Health Process and their national efforts to advance the climate change and health agenda."""
5;"""Experts warn of serious health impacts from climate change for pregnant women, children, and older people. Pregnant women, newborns, children, adolescents and older people are facing serious health complications due to climate change, according to a new collection of papers published in the Journal of Global Health, and yet the specific needs of these groups have been largely neglected in the climate response.
The articles document the available scientific evidence on the health impacts of different climate hazards at key life stages, from heatwaves to air pollution and natural disasters like wildfires and flooding. Together, they show that climate-related health risks have been crucially underestimated for younger and older people and during pregnancy, with serious, often life-threatening implications.
Taking extreme heat as an example, the authors note that preterm births – the leading cause of childhood deaths – spike during heatwaves, while older people are more likely to suffer heart attacks or respiratory distress. Each additional 1°C in minimum daily temperature over 23.9°C has been shown to increase the risk of infant mortality by as much as 22.4%.
“These studies show clearly that climate change is not a distant health threat, and that certain populations are already paying a high price,” said Dr Anshu Banerjee, Director of Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and Ageing at the World Health Organization (WHO). “While awareness of climate change has increased, actions to safeguard the lives of those at most risk has barely scratched the surface of what’s needed. For climate justice to be achieved, this must be urgently redressed.”
Authored by experts from WHO and academics from around the world, the collection, titled
, reports a number of specific physical and mental health impacts that arise due to different climate hazards. For example:
are associated with adverse birth outcomes, primarily preterm birth and stillbirth, as well as hypertension and gestational diabetes in pregnancy. Heatwaves affect cognitive function and therefore learning for children and adolescents, while increasing heart attacks and respiratory complications among older people.
increases the likelihood of high blood pressure during pregnancy, low birth weight, preterm birth, and negative impacts on foetal brain and lung development. It raises risk of respiratory illness among children and older people, who also face greater risks of cancer, cardiovascular disease, and pneumonia.
have significant mental and physical health impacts.
reduce access to safe water and food supplies, increasing diarrhoeal diseases and malnutrition.
have been shown to increase respiratory disorders and cardiovascular mortality rates for older people.
While climate change affects everyone, climate-related displacements and disruptions have severe consequences for those needing regular access to health services and social support. Infants and older people as well as pregnant women may have particular physiological risk factors, such as difficulties with temperature regulation, vulnerability to dehydration, and/or weaker immune systems. They also face disproportionate impacts from the indirect effects of climate change and related disasters, like food and water shortages and spikes in vector and water-borne diseases.
“A healthy environment underpins health throughout life, enabling healthy growth and development in childhood and adolescence, healthy pregnancies and healthy ageing,” said Anayda Portela, Scientist at WHO and an author on the papers. “There is an urgent need to mitigate climate change by reducing greenhouse gas emissions and to build climate resilience; to take specific actions that protect health at these various life stages, and to ensure continuity of health services for those most at risk when climate disasters occur.”
By documenting the health impacts of different climate hazards for particular populations, the researchers aim to help governments and programmes address risks and plan to take action. Currently, few climate adaptation measures are tailored for the specific needs of women, infants, children and adolescents, the authors note, as well as older people who may have mobility and cognitive constraints. Measures should include preparing childcare, social care and educational systems for extreme weather events and rising temperatures, the articles note, as well as engaging people of all ages in climate action, dialogue, and planning.
2023 was the warmest year on record in over 170 years, and there were multiple climate emergencies from wildfires to cyclones, flooding, and extreme heat.

6;"""Environment and health issues are a top concern: interview with Austėja Sakalauskaitė, youth activist. Austėja Sakalauskaitė, a medical student from Lithuania, brings a unique blend of health-care knowledge and communication skills to her youth activism. She found her purpose in the Lithuanian Medical Students’ Association and the International Youth Health Organization, where she became more involved in impactful information and advocacy campaigns for her peers.
Discovering low vaccination rates for tick-borne encephalitis in her home country sparked her engagement in health policy dialogue. But it is climate change and its impact on health that eventually became Austėja’s primary focus, leading her to join WHO/Europe's Youth4Health network. There, she continues campaigning for a healthier, more sustainable future alongside fellow youth activists.
Ahead of International Youth Day, we talked with Austėja about the urgency of environment and health issues, her drive to improve public health, and the role of youth organizations and networks in global climate and health negotiations.
: Why do you think Youth4Health network members mentioned environment and health issues as their top concern in a recently conducted survey, and why did you become more involved in this area of activism?
: I believe we're not talking enough about the direct impact of climate change on our health and its long-term prospects. It's a pressing issue that affects our physical and mental health and exacerbates global inequalities.
For example, think about the heat waves we have worldwide in the summer, which wasn't the case 10 or 20 years ago. Even for us as young people, it's getting hard to get outside and lead our everyday lives in this heat, not to mention the strain it puts on seniors and adults with existing health conditions.
Think about marginalized communities that are disproportionately affected compared to all others. We see people dying every day because they do not have access to clean water or because of the spread of communicable diseases, as mosquitoes are getting more active in those areas.
As part of the Youth4Health network, I want to increase understanding of how we want our health to be sustainable.
: Based on what you hear from young people like yourself, are there any new health issues in your community that you think are linked to what is happening to the environment? We talk a lot right now about climate anxiety, for example.
: The mental health aspect of climate change stands out to me most. As young people, we don't get enough information about what is getting done regarding climate change, and we worry about our future and the future of the next generations. Many are dealing with mental health struggles as they are forced to move from the places where they were born and used to live because of rising sea levels or depleting natural resources. We do not know what our lives will look like even in 5 to 10 years. This needs to change.
: How should we explain the urgency behind advocating for environment and health issues together?
: If we fail to mitigate the impact of climate change on health, we will see a lot of health problems emerging and resurfacing, which will inevitably affect our life expectancy and quality of life. Heat-related illnesses, infectious diseases, a spike in chronic lung conditions, such as asthma caused by worsened air quality, malnutrition – especially in areas where access to clean water and food is scarce – and a lack of resources in hospitals to treat such patients, to name a few.
I would urge world leaders to take bold actions within climate change negotiations and consider the health implications of climate change in the decision-making process to create a healthy world for all of us. They must understand how climate change directly impacts health outcomes because our future depends on the actions they take today to protect our planet and our people.
: How do you overcome stereotypes about young people's lack of capacity to meaningfully contribute their knowledge and expertise?
: A lot of young people, including myself, have imposter syndrome: we know we have a valuable opinion, but very few listen to us because we are too young or don't have enough experience. We often hear that we don't know how the world works, but this is exactly what we're trying to change!
In this context, I'm reminding myself not to lose focus. That's why building communities of like-minded people, like the one we have in Youth4Health, is so important, where we can inspire and support each other. Joining such networks and organizations helps you see that you can bring new, valuable ideas that adults didn't even think of.
It starts with one person who believes in you, which in turn motivates you to achieve new heights. Yes, we will still have those days of helplessness, and we will still ask ourselves if our work actually makes a difference, but it does. We have to accept that things will not change in seconds, days, or months, but taking consistent small steps every day can spark bigger changes.
How can we ensure that young people are really heard and seen in international health forums and at all levels of health decision-making?
: It is essential to participate in conversations with them strategically and consistently, not just as a one-time event. This is why it is vital for us as young activists to have WHO support. When national governments see WHO endorse the Youth4Health network and youth-led initiatives and events, they listen to us and discover that we have much to offer.
: What's your take on young people's role in bringing health topics to climate negotiations like COP29? How can this be done?
: COP29 is an amazing opportunity to push policy-makers to include health in climate negotiations. As youth, we have to be present at COP29, talk about connection between climate change and health, and represent not just youth voices but the voices of the future generations. We should be vocal and use social media advocacy to spread awareness about this topic and the challenges climate change creates for public health.
In addition, youth presence at COP29 is crucial because this is a platform to form coalitions with NGOs [nongovernmental organizations], health and climate experts, and activists passionate about this topic. As long as more people join our cause, our voice will be heard, and we can have a stronger impact on the results of these negotiations.
: And how are you planning to use the Budapest Youth Declaration for your campaigning and advocacy?
: This is the document everyone can consult to understand young people's opinions on this topic. It is a young people's manifesto urging world leaders to prioritize health in climate change negotiations. It also lays out what we, as young people, commit to doing and what we expect from others.
The Declaration is very concise and precise. At COP29, we can definitely use it to highlight what young people want in climate policies and what concrete actions we should take to achieve a healthier and more sustainable future for us and future generations. This tool positions our youth organizations and networks as a force to be reckoned with.
: Can you tell us more about the European Environment and Health Process (EHP) Partnership on Youth?
: This is our effort to involve young people in developing and implementing policies that address environment and health issues. As part of this mechanism, they collaborate with governments on concrete projects and raise youth organizations' profiles as credible partners.
In my view, the most important thing about the EHP Partnership on Youth is balance: in our rules, we encourage Member States from the WHO European Region to join together with youth organizations from their country, so that there isn't one side whose voice outweighs all others. To apply, Member States can send an email request to info@yho.network.
The EHP Partnership on Youth is very horizontal and enables youth to get involved in a variety of topics around climate and health. For example, members can choose a topic they want to work on together when they join, and our role is to facilitate this collaboration and youth involvement at all levels of such discussions.
: And what kind of support do you think young people and youth organizations need to feel empowered to keep up their work? What do you think is required from governments and society at large on different levels?
: The main thing is just getting involved – if not in large-scale political debates, then even in the smallest events at the local level. Amplifying youth voices should become a whole-of-society priority as our impact increases with numbers.
Collaboration between organizations is key: in my home country, Lithuania, we set up youth groups to gather multiple perspectives on a specific topic across different youth coalitions and form a unified stance. Yes, we will not get everything just because there are so many of us and many aspects to consider, but at least we will get the bigger picture – a small change that makes a huge difference.
We still have to somehow push our opinion and ask to be invited to major events. We have already seen how governments and international organizations like WHO are starting to involve youth in discussions of policies or new research. But we certainly are eager to have more of them support our cause.
: Are there any positive breakthroughs that give you hope and desire to keep up this great work
: Raising awareness about meaningful youth engagement at this interview is already a positive change. However, I'd also like to mention the community engagement component and increased cross-sectoral collaboration.
For example, I am currently part of the youth technical advisory board at the Sustainaware: Climate Action Going Digital project. We're creating an online escape room to help our peers understand how climate and health are interconnected through experiential learning. I'm giving something back to the community so that they can boost their knowledge while also making personal connections with people from different sectors. I hope that people who are now involved in [health] advocacy will continue in the future and become the new leaders of our world."""

human activities have been the main driver of climate change
, primarily due to the burning of fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas.
Burning fossil fuels generates greenhouse gas emissions that act like a blanket wrapped around the Earth, trapping the sun’s heat and raising temperatures.
The main greenhouse gases that are causing climate change include carbon dioxide and methane. These come from using gasoline for driving a car or coal for heating a building, for example. Clearing land and cutting down forests can also release carbon dioxide. Agriculture, oil and gas operations are major sources of methane emissions. Energy, industry, transport, buildings, agriculture and land use are among the

than it was in the late 1800s (before the industrial revolution) and warmer than at any time in the last 100,000 years. The
last decade (2011-2020) was the warmest on record

In the future, the number of people displaced by weather-related events is expected to rise.

some countries produce much more than others

The six biggest emitters (China, the United States of America, India, the European Union, the Russian Federation, and Brazil) together accounted for more than half of all global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. By contrast, the 45 least developed countries accounted for only 3 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions.
Everyone must take climate action, but people and countries creating more of the problem have a greater responsibility to act first.

Many climate change solutions can deliver economic benefits while improving our lives and protecting the environment. We also have global frameworks and agreements to guide progress, such as the

8;"""Climate Change and Malaria: A Complex Relationship. Climate change is defined as a statistically significant variation in either the mean state of the climate or in its variability, persisting for an extended period -- typically decades or longer -- that may be attributed to natural internal processes, external forcing, or persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the atmosphere or in land use.
Malaria, the world's most important and deadly tropical mosquito-borne parasitic disease, kills approximately 1 million people and afflicts as many as 1 billion people in 109 countries throughout Africa, Asia, and Latin America.
Reducing the impact of malaria will significantly enhance the efforts to achieve the Millennium Development Goals, agreed upon by every United Nations Member State.
Variation in climatic conditions, such as temperature, rainfall patterns, and humidity, has a profound effect on the longevity of the mosquito and on the development of malaria parasites in the mosquito and, subsequently, on malaria transmission.
The global temperature has risen significantly over the past 100 years, with an accelerated warming trend since the mid-1950s.
Elementary modelling suggests that this increase will enhance the transmission rates of mosquito-borne disease and widen its geographical distribution,
with an increase in malaria, in particular, being identified as a potential impact of climate change.
While some studies report an increase in the spread of the disease in the current malaria endemic areas,
or a reemergence of the disease in areas which have controlled transmission or eliminated the disease in the past,
others report no association between malaria and climate change.
Historically, malaria was endemic in Europe, including Scandinavia, but was eliminated in 1975 -- despite the increase in global temperature -- due to better socio-economic conditions, improved irrigation and drainage, adoption of new farming methods, behavioural changes, and access to better health care.
Due to the complex relationship between malaria and climate change, gaps in knowledge still exist in the mechanisms of the linkage. Climate change will increase the opportunities for malaria transmission in traditionally malarious areas, in areas the disease has been controlled, as well as in new areas which have been traditionally non-malarious. An increase in temperature, rainfall, and humidity may cause a proliferation of the malaria-carrying mosquitoes at higher altitudes, resulting in an increase in malaria transmission in areas in which it was not reported earlier.
At lower altitudes where malaria is already a problem, warmer temperatures will alter the growth cycle of the parasite in the mosquito enabling it to develop faster, increasing transmission and thus having implications on the burden of disease.
Climate change greatly influences the El Niño cycle that is known to be associated with increased risks of some diseases transmitted by mosquitoes, such as malaria, dengue, and Rift Valley fever. In dry climates, heavy rainfall can provide good breeding conditions for the mosquitoes. Increased humidity, droughts may turn rivers into strings of pools, the preferred breeding sites of mosquitos.
In some areas, heavy rainfall can wash out the breeding sites and reduce the incidence of malaria. In Colombia and Venezuela, malaria cases increased by more than one-third following dry conditions associated with El Niño. In Sri Lanka, before the use of DDT (a synthetic agricultural pesticide used in controlling malarial life cycle), the risk of malaria increased three-fold following the failure of monsoons, which were also associated with El Niño. In Southern Africa, countries have recently experienced malaria epidemics following unusual rainfall.
Western and north-western India recorded more malaria cases with higher rainfall during La Niña in 1996 and less rain and fewer malaria cases in the same area during El Niño in 1998.
In short, the changes in the El Niño cycle have the ability to increase the malariogenic potential resulting in malaria epidemics.
It may not be possible to quantify how climate change affects malaria transmission, which depends on many factors such as population and demographic dynamics, drug resistance, insecticide resistance, human activities such as deforestation, irrigation, swamp drainage, etc., and their impact on the local ecology. Further, other impacts of climate change may cause increased susceptibility to malaria. For example, negative impacts on health, which could contribute to social degradation and economic loss, may result in the inability to seek early diagnosis and treatment or impair control activities such as insecticidal spraying, thereby increasing transmission of the disease. The economics of decreasing malaria transmission by mitigating climatic changes via carbon dioxide emissions, versus using other methods, have been modelled. It is estimated that for the cost of saving one life by cutting down on carbon, 78,000 lives may be saved annually by using mosquito nets, environmentally safe indoor DDT sprays, and subsidies for effective, new combination therapies.
Surveillance and preparedness have been major components of the malaria control strategy, adopted since 1992 by the World Health Organization (WHO). In addition to early diagnosis and prompt, effective treatment, selective vector control and capacity building to prevent epidemics and control transmission have been the other areas of focus.
The emergence of three innovations in dipsticks for diagnosis, artemisinins for treatment of malaria, and insecticide-treated nets for prevention of transmission in the 1990s, coupled with new initiatives such as the Roll Back Malaria initiative of WHO, the establishment of the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria, as well as the inclusion of malarial indicators in the Millennium Development Goals has led to a renewed interest in malaria control. All these efforts ensured that surveillance, including early detection and prompt treatment of cases and capacity building, together with preparedness, were given priority.
The elimination of malaria from selected countries is stated explicitly in the targets of the Global Malaria Action Plan.
Considerable progress has been achieved in malaria elimination in some countries during the past few years. By 2015, at least eight to ten countries currently in the elimination stage are expected to achieve zero incidence of locally transmitted infection. Beyond 2015, countries currently in the pre-elimination stage are expected to move into the elimination phase. Consistent with the goals of the Global Malaria Action Plan, as of 2009, three countries that were in the elimination phase -- Armenia, Egypt and Turkmenistan -- have reported no locally acquired cases for more than three years, and have moved into the phase of prevention of reintroduction. Six countries -- Azerbaijan, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan -- all from the WHO European Region, had moved from the pre-elimination stage to a nationwide elimination approach by 2009.
Climate change would, perhaps, increase the epidemic potential of malaria in tropical countries currently susceptible to the disease. Increasing temperatures and global travel have the potential to reintroduce or increase transmission of malaria in tropical and temperate countries that have either eliminated or controlled transmission. Such countries would be prone to epidemics, since surveillance and preparedness for malaria control may not be as intense as when malaria was a major public health problem in these countries. It is in this context that surveillance and preparedness need to be emphasized, not compromised. This is especially true in developing countries that have to balance competing interests for scarce resources, some of which need not necessarily be health related. Let's not forget the setbacks of the eradication era, which showed much promise in the initial phases, but had to be abandoned later -- the classic example being the near elimination of malaria from Sri Lanka in 1963.""

9;"""The Pattern of Response to HIV/AIDS and Climate Change – A Commentary. Almost three decades into the HIV/AIDS pandemic, there is still widespread stigma, denial and government inaction. There are reports of rising rates of infection in the Western industrialized nations and concerns about the possibility of explosive epidemics in the Asian block; yet sub-Saharan Africa, with less than 15 per cent of the world's population, remains at the epicentre of the epidemic, with over 70 per cent of the infections worldwide.
Given the amount of time and energy devoted to AIDS, it is sobering to ask why this should be the case. Starting with the World Health Organization's Global Programme on AIDS which developed into the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), there has been, almost since the start of the epidemic, a very high-level, globalized response: biannual international AIDS conferences which attract over 10,000 people; regional AIDS conferences and many related conferences on drug use, sexuality and public health; a UN General Assembly Special Session in 2001; regional government meetings resulting in declarations and statements of intent; a range of donors funding HIV/AIDS-related work around the world; and a seemingly endless range of training manuals for education, prevention, community care and support, gender equity, treatment and care.
High-level meetings are held to ensure that Governments are held accountable and that populations are able to respond effectively. Prominent people are asked to endorse campaigns, be tested for the virus, disclose their status, and lead the fight against HIV/AIDS as well as AIDS-related stigma and discrimination.
And yet, despite all this energy, dedication and commitment, in many parts of the world infection rates are rising, communities are dealing with high numbers of death and suffering, families are affected by the death of young people, and millions of youth face an uncertain future due to the death of their parents, siblings and relatives. The provision of treatments seemed to herald a new era in HIV/AIDS, and drugs have been promoted as the best option for ""prevention"". Today, as the expected success of voluntary counselling, testing and treatments has not materialized, there is the push for male circumcision and for an end to concurrency in sexual relationships.
HIV/AIDS is one of the most fascinating social issues of our time. It has bred in the existing fault lines of society and exposed new ones. Old tensions in society that have been tolerated or hidden have been exposed. The reality of gender inequality and patriarchy and the abuse and exploitation of young people have been exposed; the lack of food, housing, education, health care and access to medications have been exposed. The pandemic has also starkly highlighted the inequality as well as the hypocrisy of societies and global political relationships.
HIV/AIDS has, in many instances, shown how difficult it is to make democracy and accountability effective, how culture and cultural practices collude with the epidemic and fuel it, and how corruption permeates through all societies, whether rich or poor. The pandemic has opened a new form of neo-colonialism as donors and UN agencies patronize the developing world about bad governance and offer technical support and funding.
UN agencies and many donors are, however, caught in a bind. They want an effective global response, but they also have to recognize that it may fail precisely because a global response oversimplifies the pandemic and the societies that suffer from it. Often, these outside groups define not only the pandemic but also the societies in which they are working. They tend to frame the pandemic in generalized ways, giving money for specific projects that they alone define, evaluate and lead, and which they believe best suit the people living in that society.
These interventions may indeed mitigate the present situation and may also lead to some long-term social and political changes, but they cannot address the root causes of poverty and disease which are deeply ingrained in post-colonial heritage, international political relationships, entrenched global inequality and a failure to respect human rights.
The HIV/AIDS pandemic grows from and contributes to poverty, hunger, exploitation, migration, lack of education and a failure of political will and imagination. In most cases the reaction to the pandemic has been to describe ""what is"" and to find attempts to manage the existing status quo and protect it from anticipated effects. Rather, our reaction should be to actively seek out ""what could be"" and find ways to challenge and change the status quo into a future that looks at new social, community and family formations, new ways of understanding sexuality and human rights.
We are seeing exactly the same patterns of response to climate change, which are the consequences of a lack of social and political integrity in the dominant world economic and political order. Just like HIV/AIDS, climate change has attracted many nations and the UN to develop protocols and adopt declarations. People are exhorted to change their behaviour with dire warnings and predictions of calamities.
The spread of HIV/AIDS and the impact of climate change have many things in common. People with the least amount of resources are affected most. There is also a lack of political will and the technical capabilities to contain either calamity. Third, even if people are included in mitigation, decisions will be made for and about them. Communities often cannot act on declarations and protocols because in reality they are unable to carry out the good intentions of the policy makers. Fourth, just as HIV/AIDS exacerbates poverty, gender vulnerability, exploitation of children, and access to health care, so too may climate change heighten social dislocations.
Many people migrating from oppressive regimes and poverty, seeking a better life, may be joined by ""climate refugees"", and wealthy nations may find ways to deny them entry. Like with HIV/AIDS, people are looking for ways to protect and strengthen the status quo from the impact of climate change, rather than creating a fundamentally changed world, with an intellectual curiosity that will allow us to devise new ways of living.
In large measure, the inability to stem the spread of HIV/AIDS and deal effectively with pressing social and health needs has come about because of a lack of emphasis on good research. Social science research was needed so that we could understand the effects of race, class, culture and gender in societies in which the epidemic was playing itself out. Impetus on social research has been swept aside in the need for quick fix solutions and for Governments to preserve existing political relationships as we know them.
HIV/AIDS and climate change may radically and fundamentally alter the world, and yet we cling to the existing world order, without investing the time and money to foster critical research into the issues that both the epidemic and global warming raise. We seek easy solutions and lock complex issues into neatly packaged sound bites and politically correct clichés. We have not produced critical insights into how diverse societies and power operate, and we have not produced viable and innovative ways in which political systems might change.
Beyond the declarations and the rhetoric, there needs to be good, critical, stimulating research in both fields that will allow societies to imagine a new, challenging and attainable future. Just as we need to think ahead to tackle the fall out from HIV/AIDS, we need to think quicker than climate change.

10;"""Children face unprecedented challenges by 2050, UNICEF report warns. The State of the World’s Children 2024: The Future of Childhood in a Changing World’, explores three megatrends young people face including climate disasters, demographic shifts and technological disparities that will dramatically reshape childhood by 2050.

“It is shocking that in the 21st century, any child still goes hungry, uneducated, or without even the most basic healthcare,” UN Secretary António Guterres said in his World Children’s Day message.

“It is a stain on humanity’s conscience when children’s lives are caught in the grinding wheels of poverty or upended by disasters”.

Climate emergency threatens lives
In a stark warning the report reveals children will face eight times more exposure to extreme heatwaves and triple the risk of extreme river floods compared to the 2000s.

Following 2023’s record-breaking temperatures, projected climate hazards will disproportionately affect children based on their socioeconomic settings and access to resources.

“Children are experiencing a myriad of crises from climate shocks to online dangers, and these are set to intensity in the years to come,” warned UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell.

“Creating a better future in 2050 requires more than just imagination, it requires action. Decades of progress, particularly for girls, are under threat”.

Shifting demographics
The report also projects significant population changes, with Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia hosting the largest child populations by the 2050s.

While still high, Africa’s child population will drop below 40 per cent – down from 50 per cent in 2000s. East Asia and Western Europe’s data show a 17 per cent drop compared to 29 perc cent and 20 percent for those regions during the 2000s.

These demographic shifts create challenges, with some countries under pressure to expand services for large child populations, while others balance the needs of a growing elderly population.

Digital divide
While artificial intelligence and frontier technologies offer new opportunities, the report reveals the digital gap remains stark: In 2024 over 95 percent of people in high-income countries have internet access compared to merely 26 percent in low-income countries.

The report notes that youth in developing countries particularly struggle to access digital skills, impacting their educational and workplace prospects.

Signs of hope
Despite these concerns, some positive trends have emerged. Life expectancy at birth continues to rise, and nearly 96 per cent of children globally are expected to receive primary education by the 2050s.

Increased investment in education and public health, and more stringent environmental protection could narrow the gender gap and reduce exposure to environmental hazards, the report reveals.

UNICEF recommends urgent investment in education, services and sustainable and resilient cities for children.

The agency aims to boost climate resilience in infrastructure, technology, essential services and social support systems as well as delivering connectivity and safe technology design for all children.

“The decisions that world leaders make today – or fail to make – define the world children will inherit, Ms. Russell emphasised. """
11;"""Growing or shrinking? What the latest trends tell us about the world’s population. It will then fall to around 10.2 billion, which is 700 million lower than expected a decade ago. That’s just one of the key findings revealed in Thursday’s World Population Prospects 2024 report published by the UN Thursday.

However, changes in global population are uneven and the demographic landscape is evolving, with rapid population growth in some places and rapid ageing in others, making reliable population data “more important than ever”, said the UN sexual and reproductive health agency (UNFPA), heralding the report which is published to coincide with World Population Day.

The report “must be used to reach and respond to the needs of those who have been left behind,” the agency added.


‘Everyone counts’
Marking the international day, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said it was key to accurately count everyone “because everyone counts.”

“Our rich human tapestry is only as strong as its weakest thread. When data and other systems work for those on the margins, they work for everyone. This is how we accelerate progress for all.”

To study this population data more closely, the 28th edition of World Population Prospects (WPP) published by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs (DESA) since 1951, provides the latest demographic data for 237 countries from 1950 to 2024 and projections up to the year 2100.

The WPP is crucial to monitor the Sustainable Development Goals, with about a quarter of the indicators relying on its data.

Lower fertility, an ageing population
The world’s overall fertility rates are dropping, with women having one child fewer on average than they did around 1990.

In more than half of all countries and areas, the average number of live births per woman is below 2.1 - the level required for a population to maintain a constant size.

Meanwhile, nearly a fifth of all countries and areas, including China, Italy, the Republic of Korea and Spain, now have “ultra-low fertility”, with fewer than 1.4 live births per woman over a lifetime.

Reaching the peak
As of 2024, population size has peaked in 63 countries and areas, including China, Germany, Japan and the Russian Federation, and the total population of this group is projected to decline by 14 per cent over the next thirty years.

The average age of the population of the world is also increasing.

By the late 2070s, the number of persons 65 years or older is projected to surpass the number of persons under 18.

This is in part due to the overall increase in life expectancy and decrease in mortality rates over the past three decades. By the late 2050s, more than half of all global deaths will occur at age 80 or higher, a substantial increase from 17 per cent in 1995.

Rapid growth
While the slow growth or decline of populations is occurring mainly in high-income countries, rapid population growth will occur in low-income and lower-middle-income countries.

Specifically, Angola, the Central African Republic, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Niger, and Somalia, very rapid growth is projected, with their total population doubling between 2024 and 2054.

This population growth will increase demand for resources, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia and, combined with poorly managed urbanisation and rising living standards, it will worsen environmental impacts.

Climate change, a major challenge, affects these countries the most, where many rely on agriculture - and food insecurity is prevalent.

In countries including India, Indonesia, Nigeria, Pakistan and the United States, population is also expected to increase through 2054 and could potentially peak in the second half of the century or later.

Reproductive health
Central to population and development is the “recognition that women’s sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights are cornerstones of sustainable development,” said Secretary-General Guterres.

Particularly in low-income countries, early pregnancies remain a challenge.

In 2024, 4.7 million babies, or about 3.5 per cent of the total worldwide, were born to mothers under the age of 18.
Of these, some 340,000 were born to children under 15, with serious consequences for the health and well-being of both the young mothers and their children.

Investing in the education of young people, especially girls - and increasing the ages of marriage and first childbearing in countries where these have an early onset - will have positive outcomes for women’s health, educational attainment and labour force participation, according to WPP data.

These efforts will also contribute to reducing the scale of the investments required to achieve sustainable development while ensuring that no one is left behind."""
12;"""UN reviews progress and challenges 30 years after landmark population conference. Dennis Francis was speaking at an event  to mark the 30th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development, held in Cairo.

The landmark conference concluded with a Programme of Action, adopted by 179 governments, that put reproductive rights, gender equality and the empowerment of women, girls and young people at the heart of development.

Uneven progress
Mr. Francis pointed to significant advances and progress made since then, particularly in the areas of poverty reduction, life expectancy and food security. Maternal deaths have declined, he said, while access to primary education has expanded, for both girls and boys.“But, we must also admit that progress has been uneven, both within and among countries,” he said, as climate change, conflict and other crises have jeopardised many of these hard-won gains.

Nevertheless, the visionary objectives outlined in the Programme of Action “have only grown in importance”, he added, noting their connection to the global push to achieve sustainable development for all by 2030.

Support women and girls
“We must certainly do much more to acknowledge that empowered women and girls, children and others in vulnerable situations are central for peaceful, prosperous and sustainable societies and proactively do much more to support and facilitate them in the full realisation of their potential,” he said.

As many of the challenges that have hampered implementation of the Programme of Action persist, Mr. Francis urged countries to “find fresh, innovative ways” to both address and overcome them.

“And let us rededicate ourselves, in earnest, to a shared future of peace, prosperity, progress and sustainability for all, with all, everywhere,” he concluded.Accelerate action, set priorities
Separately, the UN Deputy Secretary-General called for the anniversary of the Programme of Action to be an opportunity to both accelerate action on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and to set priorities for the next 30 years.

Amina Mohammed delivered remarks to the 57th session of the UN Commission on Population and Development, which runs through Friday.

With the global population now surpassing eight billion, she said the international community must prepare for continued population growth in sub-Saharan Africa and slow growth or decline in much of Asia, Europe and Northern America and later in Latin America and the Caribbean.

Missing the mark
While great progress has been made over the past three decades, she said many countries are still falling short of life expectancy targets, and many developing countries face significant challenges in achieving the SDG target on child mortality.

Additionally, 164 million women of reproductive age worldwide have no access to family planning services.

“While all countries are on the path towards longer lives and smaller families, some continue to face the challenges of rapid population growth. Others are grappling with the consequences of population ageing, sometimes population decline. And we see our health systems struggling,” she said.

Push back against pushbacks
Ms. Mohammed underlined the need for countries to fully recognise the megatrends that are reshaping the world today such as climate change, demographic shifts and urbanisation and their critical connections to the SDGs.

“We must remain vigilant and continue to address situations where sexual and reproductive health and rights are being rolled back,” she said. “We must respond and push back when women’s rights are being eroded and when migrants and other vulnerable populations are mistreated.”

She urged the international community to “continue to uphold the dignity of all people, ensuring that no one is left behind” and to “support rights-based approaches in our population and development policies”."""
13;"""47 million health workers and advocates call for cleaner air to curb pollution deaths. The Second WHO Global Conference on Air Pollution and Health co-hosted by the World Health Organization and Colombia, in the city of Cartagena, brought together over 700 participants from 100 countries - including heads of state, ministers, scientists, and civil society groups — to accelerate action to curb what’s increasingly described as a full-scale health emergency. 

“It is time to move from commitments to bold actions,” said Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General. 

“To achieve clean air, we need urgent actions on all fronts: financial investment in sustainable solutions, such as in clean energy and sustainable transport, technical enforcement of WHO global air quality guidelines, and social commitment to protect the most vulnerable in our most polluted regions.” 

The shared goal? A 50 per cent reduction in the health impacts of air pollution by 2040. 

Countries including Brazil, Spain, China, and the United Kingdom laid out national roadmaps, while the Clean Air Fund pledged an additional $90 million for climate and health programmes. 

Cities which are part of the C40 network, including London, vowed to strengthen air quality monitoring and push for greater investment in clean air strategies. A health crisis hidden in plain sight 
According to WHO, air pollution is responsible for seven million premature deaths annually and is now the second leading global risk factor for disease, after hypertension. 

“Today air pollution is the first risk factor for disease burden,” said Maria Neira, WHO’s Director of Environment, Climate Change and Health. “It's the number one risk factor for getting sick.” 

The burden is heaviest in countries with fast-growing cities and weak regulatory frameworks. But Ms. Neira pointed out that the economic costs and health toll are rising globally. “Those chronic diseases are costing us well – to our health system and to our hospitals,” she said. 

Despite the grim statistics, WHO leaders say solutions are at hand. Ms. Neira cited China’s progress in cutting emissions while continuing to grow economically. “At one point they demonstrated that you can reduce air pollution while still maintaining economic growth,” she said. “This argument that in order to tackle the causes of climate change, air pollution and environmental health, you need to invest and you don't obtain benefits immediately – that's not correct.” 

Climate and health emergency 
Indeed, air pollution is not just a public health issue but a key driver and symptom of the climate crisis. The burning of fossil fuels which feeds air pollution also releases greenhouse gases – adding to global warming. 

“Climate change causes and air pollution causes overlap,” said Ms. Neira. “We have a lot to gain for health, for the economy, and for society, sustainable development, if we accelerate this transition.” 

She emphasized that clean air solutions – including renewable energy, better urban design, and phasing out fossil fuels – also serve as climate mitigation strategies. 

“This pollution, this particulate matter we are breathing every day…is coming from different sources, but fundamentally from the combustion of fossil fuels,” she said. “This can be avoided only by accelerating the transition to more renewables; cleaner sources of energy.” Examples from Colombia and Europe 
Hosts Colombia presented a slate of national initiatives, including cleaner fuels, zero-emission public transit, and a target to reduce carbon emissions 40 per cent by 2030. 

“Air pollution claims more victims than violence itself. Poisoning our air costs lives in silence – this conference reinforces our determination to implement policies for both the environment and the health of our people,” said Colombia’s President Gustavo Petro. 

He stressed the importance of smarter regulation and bridging the inequality gap with indigenous peoples, local and rural communities. 

In Europe, where air pollution still causes 300,000 premature deaths annually, lawmakers are moving toward stricter regulation. “Pollution is an invisible pandemic. It is a slow-motion pandemic,” underscored Javier López, Vice President of the European Parliament’s Environment Committee. 

The European Union recently adopted a new Air Quality Directive, halving legal air pollution thresholds and aiming to reduce pollution-related deaths by 30 per cent by 2030. “We have decided to come up with the air quality directive, which is part of the European Green Package,” Mr. López said. 

Regional model, global lessons 
Officials from the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) also took part in Cartagena, highlighting the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution as one of the most successful multilateral environmental agreements to date. 

“The Air Convention…is a multilateral environmental agreement that was adopted in 1979 to address air pollution that crosses national borders,” said policy officer Carolin Sanz Noriega.  

Since its adoption, the convention has expanded to 51 parties and achieved deep emissions cuts across the region. “Reducing emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides by 40 to 80% from 1990 levels in the UNECE region, and for more than 30% for particulate matter,” Ms. Sanz Noriega said. 

She emphasized that the agreement’s success lies in its binding commitments, robust science, and long-standing trust-building mechanisms. “Countries implement the convention because it really brings benefits. It brings health benefits, environmental benefits, crop benefits. It has co-benefits for climate.” 

Through the Forum for International Cooperation on Air Pollution, UNECE is now working with countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia to share scientific tools and regulatory approaches. 

But a major challenge, especially in the Global South, remains technical capacity.  

“We need to make sure that the countries are able to monitor air quality. That's the first step,” Ms. Neira said. “In Africa, unfortunately, we are still missing a lot of monitoring capacity…You cannot manage what you cannot measure.” Prescribing clean air 
The health sector provided one of the key takeaways of the conference. With millions of medical professionals and individuals already backing the WHO campaign, delegates emphasized that clean air must be recognized as central to disease prevention.  

“We have 47 million signatures from health professionals, from patients, from advocates, from institutions, saying ‘I want to prescribe clean air’,” Ms. Neira said.  

“I don’t want to treat the patients with diseases caused by exposure to toxic air. I want to make sure that my patients will not be exposed and therefore they will not develop those diseases.” 

As the conference wrapped up, delegates left Cartagena emboldened with new partnerships, data, and policy options – but also a resounding moral imperative. 

“The time to generate evidence [on air pollution] has passed,” underscored Ms. Neira. “We have a lot of it. No one can say anymore that they didn’t know.” """

Climate shocks can have lifelong consequences, including on education. Since 2022, 400 million students globally have experienced school closures due to extreme weather events. Copyright: Arne Hoel/World Bank
, we explored the crucial role of investing in human capital—our health, knowledge, and skills—in addressing the climate crisis.
Today, we examine how climate change affects us from birth to old age, profoundly shaping our lives and communities.  Imagine a baby enduring a heat wave or a child missing school due to flooding. These events can have lifelong consequences, affecting health, education, income, and overall well-being.
At the World Bank’s Human Capital Project, our team is dedicated to understanding these challenges and identifying innovative solutions to protect people at every stage of life.
Climate and Development Brief: Delivering for People and the Planet
. Washington, D.C.: World Bank Group, 2022.
How does climate change affect us throughout the life cycle?
Climate change has lasting impacts on health outcomes, starting as early as in utero. It increases mortality rates and causes permanent cognitive and educational setbacks among infants and young children. Higher temperatures and changing weather patterns are projected to result in
over 21 million additional deaths linked to five major health-related issues by 2050
, with infants being the most affected. A key factor in this is the increased prevalence of vector-borne diseases and reduced access to clean water. For instance,
flooding in Bangladesh has been linked to higher rates of stunting in children due to increased water-borne diseases.
Working in extreme heat doubles the risks associated with pregnancy. Extreme weather events also hinder pregnant women from accessing medical care, leading to higher rates of newborn deaths and low birth weights.
Climate shocks disrupt education for school-age children and potentially cost them opportunities over their lifetime.
Events like flooding or cyclones prevent children from attending school and limit their access to healthcare. In
, for example, flooding destroyed over 500 schools in one year, drastically affecting children's education.
and climate highlights that these disruptions are more widespread than previously thought. Since 2022, a staggering 400 million students globally have experienced school closures due to extreme weather events. The impacts are most severe in low- and middle-income countries, where education systems are already vulnerable to climate shocks. These short-term events can have longer-term impacts. Many kids do not return to school after the shock subsides. A striking graph illustrates how flooding in Latin America can significantly reduce education, especially for children who are not yet in school during the flood.
. The legacy of natural disasters: The intergenerational impact of 100 years of disasters in Latin America
Climate change reduces productivity and earnings for working-age adults.
Over the last 60 years, rising temperatures
lengthened the transition season for malaria
, increasing by 32% in the Americas and 14% in highlands Africa. This surge in disease, especially among vulnerable workers, leads to higher absenteeism and decreased productivity. As working-age adults work less and are not as productive, they earn less income and face increased poverty.  This graph clearly illustrates how extreme heat reduces productivity, with earnings lost to heat as a share of GDP across different regions and industrial sectors. Agricultural workers in poorer regions, like Africa and South-East Asia, are the most affected.
Climate change poses significant health risks for older adults.
Heat waves are particularly dangerous for older adults. In
, comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of daily mean apparent temperature—what the temperature feels like to the human body—reveals an increase in mortality for those over 65. The elderly have higher rates of preexisting health conditions and mobility challenges, making it difficult to evacuate during disasters and recover afterward. Poor health also heightens the risks of illness from worsening air quality. In
, outdoor air pollution has been shown to decrease cognitive function, especially among elderly women in urban areas.
Investing in human capital across all ages to address climate change impacts
Combatting climate change and building resilience across all life stages is crucial. The World Bank’s Human Capital Project works to generate evidence and knowledge to help identify country-specific needs and inform investments. This involves systematically assessing climate-related vulnerabilities in developing countries, focusing on impacts on lives, livelihoods, and economies, and identifying ‘best buys’ for climate and human capital investments. Here are some examples of World Bank programs addressing risks for specific age groups:
Cash and in-kind transfers are vital for protecting human capital from the impacts of climate shocks, such as food insecurity and lost income. The
is a lifeline to many, providing regular cash transfers to over 90,000 households and maintaining a social registry with information on 300,000 potentially vulnerable households. When the 2022 lean season hit, the government quickly reached an additional 70,000 food-insecure households. These transfers ensure families can provide adequate nutrition and healthcare, directly supporting the healthy development of young children.
Integrating climate resilience into school infrastructure and curricula can also protect education outcomes.
Nigeria’s Adolescent Girls Initiative for Learning and Empowerment
invests in constructing climate-resilient, energy-efficient, and eco-friendly schools. These schools feature adaptations like rainwater harvesting structures to combat both immediate climate shocks such as floods and long-term trends related to water availability. Additionally, the program offers digital literacy and remote learning, ensuring education continues even during climate disruptions.
In response to climate change impacts on the agricultural system, the government of
, in collaboration with the World Bank, has developed initiatives to build a more resilient agricultural sector, ensuring that working-age adults can maintain stable incomes and contribute to the country's food security and economic growth.
As climate-related health risks rise, it’s crucial to protect the most vulnerable populations, including the elderly. A new
aims to improve healthcare infrastructure and services, ensuring elderly individuals receive the care they need during climate-induced health crises.
This is the second blog in series that showcases recent World Bank research to explore how human capital is critical for climate resilience, adaptation, and action. Check out the first blog

15;"""When Climate Becomes a Health Issue: How Vulnerable is Bangladesh?
Life for people living in the Jalekhali village of the Sathkira District in
has not been the same since Cyclone Aila made landfull in 2009. In this coastal village, not only did people suffer in the aftermath of the cyclone, but health effects still linger from salinity intrusion into their ponds and other bodies of water. In addition to an increase incidence of water borne diseases among women and children, the increased intake of salt has resulted in increased prevalence of high blood pressure among pregnant women. The issue
but is prevalent across coastal towns and villages in Bangladesh.  In many of these villages the ground well water is also contaminated with arsenic leaving the people with acute shortage of safe drinking water.
Bangladesh is one of the most climate vulnerable countries in the world. It is already facing enormous challenges due to extreme events such as droughts, land and coastal flooding, and other unusual weather events. Added to these challenges are the demographic and socio-economic shifts, such as rapid population growth and fast uneven urbanization.  While Bangladesh has made great strides in health indicators – increased life expectancy at birth, continued decline in child and maternal mortalities - climate change could become a hurdle in achieving the desired health outcomes- as it is expected to increase the burden of diseases both, in terms of increased morbidity and mortality.
Climate Change and Health Impacts: How Vulnerable Is Bangladesh and What Needs to be done?”
The study assesses the national vulnerability and impact on major diseases of increased climate variability and extreme events in Bangladesh.  The study also looked at the existing institutional and implementation capacity, the financial resources at the national and local levels, and existing public programs targeted at climate sensitive diseases.
The innovation in the study is that it looks at the effects of climate change on health after accounting for confounding factors such as location, economic wellbeing and access to electricity, water, healthcare, and sanitation. It allows us to identify the most vulnerable populations and the effects that different climatic factors have on their health.
Three key messages emerge from this study:
• First, the health impacts of increased climate variability and extreme weather events are projected to be significant by 2050, but well-targeted development investments to where they are most needed and the ones that are most cost efficient can mitigate the excess health burden and related economic  costs attributable to climate change.
• Second, rapid urbanization, migration and a growing urban slum population are quickly changing the population dynamics in Bangladesh and this has implications for climate-induced health risks.
• Third, different climatic factors  create different effects and confounding factors such as where someone lives, their economic well-being along with access to water, electricity, sanitation, and healthcare all impact vulnerability. The allocation of public resources to deal with climate health risks in the future should therefore be optimally targeted to reach the most vulnerable locations that are likely to be climate-health hotspots with high climate and health risks—in the most cost-effective manner.
Overall, climate change could impose a considerable additional health burden on the society, which will fall disproportionately on the vulnerable poorer groups of population having lower abilities to adapt to the health risks of climate change. The study furthers the understanding of the health impacts of climate change Bangladesh and proposes ideas to help the most vulnerable.

16;"""On climate and health 1. Climate change is the single biggest health threat facing humanity. The impacts are already harming health through air pollution, disease, extreme weather events, forced displacement, food insecurity and pressures on mental health. Every year, environmental factors take the lives of around 13 million people. 2. Meeting the goals of the Paris Agreement could save about a million lives a year worldwide by 2050 through reductions in air pollution alone. Avoiding the worst climate impacts could help prevent 250,000 additional climate-related deaths per year from 2030 to 2050, mainly from malnutrition, malaria, diarrhoea and heat stress. 3. The value of health gains from reducing carbon emissions would be approximately double the global cost of implementing carbon mitigation measures. 4. Over 90 per cent of people breathe unhealthy levels of air pollution, largely resulting from burning fossil fuels driving climate change. In 2018, air pollution from fossil fuels caused $2.9 trillion in health and economic costs, about $8 billion a day. 5. Transportation produces around 20 per cent of global carbon emissions. Alternatives like walking and cycling are not only green but also offer major health benefits, such as reducing the risk of many chronic health conditions and improving mental health. 6. Systems to produce, package and distribute food generate a third of greenhouse gas emissions. More sustainable production would mitigate climate impacts and support more nutritious diets that could prevent close to 11 million premature deaths a year. 7. Health systems are the main line of defence for populations faced with emerging health threats, including from climate change. To protect health and avoid widening health inequities, countries must build climate-resilient health systems. 8. The majority of countries identify health as a priority sector vulnerable to climate change. But a huge finance gap remains. Less than 2 per cent of multilateral climate finance goes to health projects. 9. Healthy societies rely on well-functioning ecosystems to provide clean air, fresh water, medicines and food security. These help to limit disease and stabilize the climate. But biodiversity loss is happening at an unprecedented rate, impacting human health worldwide and increasing the risk of emerging infectious diseases."""
17;"""Key Facts. Climate change refers to any change in climate over time, whether due to natural variability or as a result of human activity. Dr. Margaret Chan stated that for public health, climate change is the defining issue for the 21st century. Climate and weather variables affect the air people breathe, the food they eat, the water they drink, and the chances that they will get infected with a life-threatening infectious disease. Climate change has made a significant impact to health. It is estimated that between 2030 to 2050, climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths annually. High temperatures raise the levels of ozone and other pollutants leading to 1.2 million deaths due to cardiovascular and respiratory disease annually. Extreme weather is the most apparent effect of climate change as extreme heat waves and heavy rain storms are occurring with increase worldwide. Rising temperatures and more variable rainfall patterns are expected to reduce crop yields, compromising food security and worsening undernutrition which accounts for 3 million deaths each year. Heat stress (hyperthermia) and extreme cold (hypothermia) caused by intense short-term temperature fluctuations significantly affect health leading to increased death rates from cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. Climate sensitive diseases such as diarrhea, malaria, and malnutrition caused a significant number of deaths globally. Climate change has become the new driver of malnutrition, increasing mortality rates by 5 to 20 times. Human activities in relation to climate change such as increased urbanization, storage of water for household use, and use of cooling systems lead to an increased risk for vectorborne diseases. Introduction. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCC) defines climate change as a change which is attributed directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmosphere and an addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable time periods. The cause of climate change is the increased emission of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases which trap the energy in our atmosphere causing a greenhouse effect. This greenhouse effect warms the earth causing extreme weather patterns, compromised food security, and increased vector-related and climate-related diseases and deaths. Evidences suggests that various activities directly or indirectly caused by humans have resulted in the release of large amounts of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases in the atmosphere which causes climate change and global warming. Majority of these gases come from burning fossil fuels for the production of energy, with deforestation, industrial processes, and agricultural processes as significant contributors. Effects of climate change have made a significant impact to health. It is predicted that climate change will cause an additional 250,000 deaths annually between 2030 and 2050: 38,000 are due to heat exposure in the elderly 48,000 due to diarrhea 60,000 due to malaria 95,000 due to childhood malnutrition. 9,000 due to others Influence on Natural Disasters Current research findings suggest that climate change is causing a dramatic increase of occurrence and severity of extreme weather conditions worldwide causing destruction and massive disasters. 10 out of the 20 countries with the highest risk of disasters belong to the Western Pacific Region. The number of reported weather-related natural disasters has tripled globally. These lead to over 60,000 deaths every year mainly in developing countries. The continued increase in sea levels and occurrence of extreme weather events are expected to damage homes and business establishments as well as medical facilities. The unavailability of fresh water supply due to increasingly variable rainfall patterns can compromise hygiene, thereby increasing the risk of diarrheal disease which kills 2.2 million people every year. With the increasing frequency and intensity of floods, it is expected that it will increase the risk of water-borne diseases due to the contamination of food supplies by flood water. This could also create breeding grounds for disease-carrying insects such as mosquitoes. Effects on Food Security: Climate change is expected to affect all dimensions of food security: availability, accessibility, utilization, and food systems stability. Rising sea levels will cause floods, damage crop and affect food production and food security. Variable rainfall and increasing temperatures are expected to reduce crop yields due to increased crop failure and new patterns of pests in many developing countries where food security is already a problem. The changing sea and inland temperature, rising sea level, and changing precipitation and water availability affect the abundance, productivity, and distribution of freshwater aquatic species. The prevalence of malnutrition which currently causes 3.5 million deaths annually is expected to rise due to the decrease in the production of staple foods in many of the poorest regions as facilitated by the rising temperatures and variable precipitation. There is a need to modify consumption patterns, adopt sustainable agricultural practices, and engage in new livelihood strategies in order to keep up with the rapidly changing environment. Increased Risk of Disease Climate change affects the transmission, frequency, and severity of communicable diseases through different mechanisms depending on the nature of the disease. Changes in temperature increases the risk of acquiring food borne diseases since food is stored, transported, handled, and prepared under warm ambient conditions. Ambient temperature, humidity, and availability of water for breeding determine the distribution, reproduction rate, biting behaviour, and survival of vectors. The amount and temperature of rainfall influences the transport and transmission of infectious agents, as well as their growth and survival. Frequent flooding may increase the risk of pathogen transmission from rodents, causing diseases such as leptospirosis and tularemia. Climate change directly affects the transmission of mosquitoborne diseases, including malaria, dengue, and viral encephalitis by shifting the vectors geographic range and increasing reproductive and biting rates and by shortening the pathogen incubation period. Increases in sea surface temperatures and sea level can lead to increased incidence of water-borne infectious and toxinrelated illnesses, such as cholera and shellfish poisoning. WHO Actions Health must be seen as a main and essential concern in the climate debate WHO Recommendations In 2014, the World Health Assembly ratified a WHO work plan to mitigate the effects of climate change on health. The objectives are: Strengthening partnerships to support health and climate within and outside the United Nations system and providing leadership on health throughout the system-wide response of the United Nations to climate change. Raising awareness of the links between health and climate, and the potential for enhancing health through mitigation of the extent of climate change through The development of tools, guidance, information and training packages, as well as the networks for information dissemination. Promoting and guiding the generation of scientific evidence. Providing policy and technical support to the implementation of the public health response to climate change. The Regional Committee for the Western Pacific endorsed the Regional Framework for Action to Protect Human Health from the Effects of Climate Change in the Asia Pacific Region. (6) It encourages member states to: develop national strategies and plans to include current and predicted climate change risks to control climate-sensitive health risks and outcomes strengthen existing health infrastructure and human resources, surveillance, early warning, and communication and response systems for climate-sensitive risks and outcomes establish programmes to reduce the climate footprint of the health sector assess the health impacts of the decisions made on climate change by other sectors facilitate the health sector to actively participate in the preparation of national programmes of action actively participate in the development of a work plan to increase WHO s technical support to member states for addressing the effects of climate change on health. To estimate the range, timing, and magnitude of future health impacts induced by climate change, disease incidence data are needed to serve as baseline epidemiologic data. Adoption of best practices such as enhancing the sustainability of livelihood systems and engaging in sustainable agricultural practices must be employed. There is a need for an interdisciplinary and holistic approach among governments, societies, and individuals coupled with changes in behavior and practices in order to reduce the impact of climate change and ensure sustainability. Efficient implementation of adaptation strategies and its integration into the national health systems are essential to mitigate the health effects of the current climate variability. Surveillance systems for climate-sensitive infectious diseases should be strengthened. These include better use of early warning information to anticipate onset, duration, and intensity of epidemics. Health systems must be able to withstand climate change especially in developing countries The co-benefits of climate change reduction and improved health should be maximized. The health sector should reduce its own climate footprint. Health sector leaders must work with climate negotiators to confront climate change."""

19;"""Taking into account Health to enhance mitigation ambition WHO inputs to the Co-chairs of the Ad Hoc Working Group on the Durban Platform for Enhanced Action (ADP) The following submission has been prepared by the WHO Department of Public Health and Environment. The summary of evidence and proposals for consideration draw heavily on the report Our Planet, Our Health, Our Future: Human Health and the Rio conventions jointly produced by WHO and the Secretariats of the UNFCCC, CBD and UNCCD1. 1. Framing health and climate change The health impacts of climate change act as a tangible indicator of global progress on climate change efforts. In this regard, health is a more readily accessible concept than, for example, either carbon dioxide emissions or sustainable development. Health provides a strong link between climate change and sustainable development. Together with the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation, this forms a positive message around climate change mitigation and adaptation. It can serve as an important reminder to governments and civil society alike that there are significant health-care savings to be had from mitigation efforts, and that the ultimate objective of the UNFCCC is not only to avoid the worst impacts of climate change but also to create a healthier sustainable future. Within the UNFCCC negotiations themselves, this aim could be promoted by recalling the original article 1 definition of adverse effects, and adopting health indicators as an additional marker of global progress to enhance public understanding and political accountability. This contribution outlines the position of health as a central justification for international action on climate change. It summarizes the continually strengthening evidence for the links between human health and climate change. It further considers opportunities to improve policy linkages within the implementation of the UNFCCC and related mechanisms in order to promote both climate and health goals. 2. Mitigation of climate change and its co-benefits for health If designed wisely, policies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions have the potential to improve public health substantially, reducing the global burden of a number of diseases, including heart disease, cancer, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, mental illness, lung disease and road deaths and injuries. These ancillary benefits (co-benefits) of mitigation highlight that what is good for the environment is often also good for health. However, it is possible for this pattern to be reversed, and some mitigation policies have the potential to harm human health. There are significant cost savings to be made as a result of improved public health, which has important implications for the cost and viability of mitigation policies. Additionally, a health perspective provides a number of practical applications in its ability to identify the potential negative health impacts of well-meaning response measures and assist in the prioritization of climate change mitigation programmes. 2.1 Potential health gains through mitigation in key sectors The co-benefits of mitigation to health are often looked at from a sectoral approach, and provide a catalytic argument for the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. The potential for health cobenefits has been described in recent years in a series of papers examining health implications of case 1 For more information please refer to the chapter 2 of the WHO report Human health and the Rio Conventions http://www.who.int/globalchange/publications/reports/healthintherioconventions/en/index.html studies of mitigation policies in major sectors, and a WHO series, Health in the Green Economy, which reviews the health impacts and benefits of the mitigation policies assessed in the fourth assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Key sectors where such policies are of particular importance include household energy, transport, food and agriculture, and electricity generation. 2.2 Economic gains from health co-benefits Early evidence on economic valuation of the health co-benefits of climate change policy suggests the potential for very large gains for national economies. Valuation studies to date have mainly considered benefits through air pollution, and conclude that even considering only this mechanism, improvements in health could largely cover the economic costs of the mitigation measures. For example, a recent study in the European Union estimated the health benefits of reaching defined emission reductions targets through potential reductions in chronic respiratory and cardiovascular disease (and resultant loss of productivity) and improvements in life expectancy. It was estimated that reaching the 20% emission reduction target by 2020 would save almost 52 billion in reduced medical bills and avoided ill-health. It was further expected that a shift in European Union emission reduction targets from 20% to 30% by 2020 would result in 140 000 additional life-years and 13 million fewer non-productive days due to chronic illness. This would add up to an additional 30.5 billion, almost two thirds of the cost of the additional mitigation efforts (46 billion) . Additional savings may be found in increased productivity resulting from healthier environments and a healthier workforce. Including health and economic co-benefits gives a more comprehensive and realistic assessment of the implications of mitigation policies, and generally presents a stronger case for more sustainable choices. Consideration of the health co-benefits of climate change mitigation brings together the social, economic and environmental dimensions of climate policy, and provides an opportunity for Parties under the UNFCCC to promote a more integrated vision of sustainable development. 3 Opportunities for better linkage of climate and health goals The health co-benefits of climate change mitigation provide one of the strongest overlaps and catalysts between mitigation and adaptation negotiations. The UNFCCC provides a number of important opportunities for the public health community to engage with climate change at local, national and international levels. However, since the 1992 Rio Earth Summit the representation of health within the UNFCCC has been relatively weak. Progress towards the UNFCCC goals, and overall sustainable development, could be enhanced by better utilizing the capacities of the health community. 3.1 Linking health to mitigation and adaptation efforts The project based flexibility mechanisms under the Kyoto Protocol such as the CDM and JI provide an excellent opportunity for accelerating investment in climate change mitigation and assisting developing countries in sustainable development co-benefits, in particular health. The design and regulations of these mechanisms for sectors that offer significant health and economic co-benefits, such as the transport, housing, health infrastructure and mining sectors  could better promote health focussed sustainable development. In doing so, it is essential that regulations governing these projects facilitate the declaration, assessment, monitoring and verification of all co-benefits in particular those related to health and safety. Combined with a strong demand for offsets from an international carbon market, the continued use of flexible mechanisms like the CDM can facilitate co-benefits such as energy security, which is essential for robust and autonomous health care facilities in rural and low-income areas, benefiting both the environment and the economy of the host country. Ensuring that the adverse effects of climate change on public health and social systems are considered within the NAPs is also a critical step to enable LDCs to adequately plan and prepare for the destabilizing effects of climate change on health and health systems. A number of appropriate responses will help to remedy these imbalances. In particular, the integration of adaptation measures with efforts to strengthen health systems and stronger engagement with the health sector at all levels in strategic planning and implementation would prove beneficial. Technical and policy support could be provided to the least developed countries through health agencies to help strengthen response measures. The Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC has agreed that adaptation policies should be in part assessed and prioritized such that potential negative impacts on human health are minimized. 3.2 Health impact assessments Article 4.1(f) of the Convention affirms a commitment from Parties to the Convention to ensuring that climate change policies are designed in a way that minimizes their adverse effects on public health. While there is the potential for major co-benefits between environmental and social development, they will not be unlocked without the design of integrated policies that promote health gains and manage health risks, alongside the drive to reduce environmental impact. Mandated by resolution WHA61.19 of the World Health Assembly and an action plan endorsed by its Executive Board, WHO has developed a number of relevant tools, ranging from disaster preparedness and risk reduction to climate change-specific health impact assessment guides. Within the UNFCCC, these can be used for: assessment of global progress on tackling the issue of climate change; determining whether or not implementation strategies are appropriate; prioritization and evaluation of mitigation and adaptation programmes. Use of these tools can help ensure that UNFCCC policies, designed to benefit the environment and stabilize global emissions, are not simultaneously detrimental to health."""
20;"""Social impacts of climate change in Bolivia : a municipal level analysis of the effects of recent climate change on life expectancy, consumption, poverty and inequality (English) This paper analyzes the direct evidence of climate change in Bolivia during the past 60 years, and estimates how these changes have affected life expectancy and consumption levels for each of the 311 municipalities in Bolivia. Contrary to the predictions of most general circulation models, the evidence shows a consistent cooling trend of about 0.2C per decade over all highland areas, slight and scattered evidence of warming in the lowlands, and no systematic changes in precipitation. The estimations indicate that the 1C cooling experienced in the already cold highlands over the past five decades likely has reduced consumption possibilities by about 2-3 percent in these areas. Since the much richer population in the lowlands have benefitted slightly from recent climate change, the simulations suggest that recent climate change has contributed to an increase in inequality and poverty in Bolivia. Poor and indigenous peoples in the highlands are among the most severely affected populations. No statistically significant effect on life expectancy was found. This paper forms part of the World Bank research project ""Social Impacts of Climate Change and Environmental Degradation in the LAC Region."" The authors greatly appreciate the comments, suggestions and inputs received from Pablo Fajnzylber, Kirk Hamilton, Jacoby Hanan, Jens Hesselbjerg Christensen, Jakob Kronik, Andrea Liverani, Joergen Eivind Olesen, Claus P rtner, Tine Rossing, Olivier Rubin, Emmanuel Skoufias, Fabi n Soria and Addy Suxo. The findings, interpretations, and conclusions expressed in this paper are those of the authors and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Executive Directors of The World Bank or the governments they represent. 1. Introduction Although Bolivia is located entirely within the tropics, the large altitude variations within the country imply that it has almost every conceivable type of climate ranging from Andean glaciers, via salt deserts, to steaming rainforest. This variation makes Bolivia ideally suited for an empirical analysis of the social impacts of climate change because the limited variation in the time dimension can be complemented by ample variation in the spatial dimension. A simple way to gauge how climate affects human development is to compare human development across regions with different climates. This has, for example, been done by Horowitz (2006), which uses a cross-section of 156 countries to estimate the relationship between temperature and income level. The overall relationship found is very strongly negative, with a 2F increase in global temperatures implying a 13 percent drop in income. This is very dramatic, but the relationship is thought to be mostly historical and thus not very relevant for the prediction of the contemporary effects of climate change in the recent past or near future. In order to control for historical factors, the paper includes colonial mortality rates as an explanatory variable, and finds a much more limited, but still highly significant, contemporaneous effect of temperature on incomes. The contemporaneous relationship estimated implies that a 2F increase in global temperatures would cause approximately a 3.5 percent drop in World GDP. In order to further control for historical differences, Horowitz (2006) uses more homogeneous sub-samples, such as one with only OECD countries or only countries from the Former Soviet Union, and the negative relationship still holds. However, as directions for further research, he recommends empirical studies of income and temperature variations within large, heterogeneous countries, which would provide much more thorough control for historical differences. This is exactly what we do in this paper. Using data from the 311 municipalities in Bolivia, we estimate contemporary relationships between temperature and consumption levels (a proxy for income), as well as between temperature and life expectancy. These relationships are then used to gauge the likely direction and magnitude of effects of climate change in Bolivia. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data and the sources. Section 3 estimates municipal level econometric models of the relationships between climate variables, life expectancy, and consumption levels. Section 4 analyzes climate change in Bolivia from 1948 to 2008. Section 5 uses the estimated models from Section 3 to simulate the effect of recent climate change (from Section 4) on consumption levels, poverty and inequality. Finally, Section 6 concludes. 2. The data The data used for this paper consist of both cross-section and time series data. The municipal level cross-section data base used to estimate the relationships between climate, 2 development and migration in Bolivia is constructed using data from several different sources. Table 1 lists the variables, their definitions, and the sources of the information.

Normal annual The average annual precipitation meters Conservation precipitation in the main city of the International's GIS municipality as measured over a database reference period (usually 1961- 1990). In order to assess the climate change trends in the different parts of Bolivia, we obtained monthly temperature and precipitation data from 1948 to 2008 from the Monthly Climatic Data for the World (MCDW) publication of the US National Climatic Data Center.1 The original data are organized in 61 printed volumes with 12 issues in each (one for each month of the year), totaling 721 months. All data have been quality-checked and were published by the NCDC about 3 months after the raw data were collected. From each of these monthly issues, we extracted average monthly temperature and total monthly for each of 31 Bolivian stations, in order to create time series for each station. The ""normal"" temperature for each station-month is calculated as the average temperature observed for the reference period 1960-90. Some stations have so few and scattered 1 This data is available for free at http://www7.ncdc.noaa.gov/IPS/mcdw/mcdw.html. 3 observations that it is not feasible to calculate reliable ""normal"" temperatures, and these stations have therefore been discarded. Only the stations that have at least eight observations for each calendar month during the reference period were included in the analysis in this paper. An additional requirement for inclusion of a data station in the present analysis is that it has at least 300 out of the 721 possible monthly observations. The 18 stations that satisfy both of these requirements are listed in Table 2. Table 2: Meteorological stations in Bolivia with adequate monthly data from 1948 to 2008 Elevation Station Latitude Longitude (m) Camiri 20 00'S 63 32'W 798 Chara a 17 35'S 69 36'W 4054 Cobija 11 02'S 68 47'W 235 Cochabamba 17 25'S 66 11'W 2548 Concepci n 16 09'S 62 01'W 497 La Paz / El Alto 16 31'S 68 11'W 4058 Oruro 17 58'S 67 04'W 3707 Puerto Suarez 18 59'S 57 49'W 134 Riberalta 11 00'S 66 07'W 141 Robor 18 19'S 59 46'W 276 Rurrenabaque 14 28'S 67 34'W 204 San Ignacio de Velasco 16 23'S 60 58'W 413 San Joaqu n 13 04'S 64 49'W 140 Santa Cruz Trompillo 17 48'S 63 11'W 418 Sucre 19 01'S 65 18'W 2904 Tarija 21 33'S 64 42'W 1854 Trinidad 14 49'S 64 55'W 155 Yacuiba 21 57'S 63 39'W 645 Source: NCDC's Monthly Climatic Data for the World. Table 3 shows the average ""normal"" temperatures for each month for each of these stations. It is seen that the climate differs dramatically from region to region, with Chara a in the far west being cold throughout the year due to the high elevation, while most low-land regions are hot throughout the year due to the location close to the Equator. The difference in temperature between the warmest and the coldest month also varies. In Cobija and Riberalta, for example, the difference between the warmest and the coldest month is less than 3 C. Yacuiba is the southernmost station in Bolivia and therefore the station that shows the most marked temperature variations over the year, but the difference between the warmest and the coldest month is still only 11 C. 4  Using the ""normal"" values for each station and each month, we calculate monthly anomalies for each station for the whole period (actual temperature minus normal temperature for that month). Anomalies are easier to analyze than the raw temperature and precipitation data, since the seasonal variation is eliminated through the subtraction of normal monthly temperatures. Figure A1 in the Appendix plots the temperature anomalies for each station. The precipitation data applied in the analyses have been subjected to the same procedure, and all precipitation anomalies are plotted in Figure A2 of the Appendix. 3. Modeling climate and human development Bolivia is a very heterogeneous country both with respect to climate and with respect to development. Some regions have extremely harsh climates with sub-zero temperatures most of the year and very little rain. Other regions are hot and constantly humid. Some people live in remote areas without road access in simple one-room dwellings without electricity, piped water, bathroom, or any other basic conveniences. Other people live in mansions with home cinema, swimming pool, fitness room, and servants. 5 This variation makes Bolivia ideally suited for estimating the impact of climate on development, as the limited variation in time can be complemented by ample variation in space, while still holding the most important confounding variables constant. As proxies for human development, we will use the following two variables: (i) life expectancy at birth, and (ii) consumption per capita. Across the 311 municipalities in Bolivia, life expectancy at birth varies between 40 and 70 years, while annual consumption per capita varies between $245 and $2,565 (purchasing power adjusted international dollars of the year 2001). The variables of principal interest are the climate variables: average temperature and average precipitation. Simple correlations between these and the two human development variables are presented in Table 4. According to these simple correlations, warm and wet is good, while cold and dry is bad for human development. Table 4: Correlations between climate variables and HDI at the municipal level Variable Correlation with Correlation with Life expectancy Consumption Average annual temperature 0.46 0.34 Average annual precipitation 0.29 0.26 In order to control for other differences between municipalities, we include the climate variables in a regression framework together with two important control variables: Education levels and urbanization rates, which are both unlikely to be affected by climate changes in the short run, but are clearly related to life expectancy and consumption levels. It is also important to allow for non-linear effects, as both too high and too low temperatures may be unfavorable for human development, just as both too much and too little rain may cause problems (e.g. Mendelsohn, Nordhaus & Shaw, 1994; Quiggin & Horowitz, 1999; Masters & McMillan, 2001, Tol, 2005).  The life expectancy regression will take the same form as the consumption regression, except that we will not apply the natural logarithm to the dependent variable. Both regressions are weighted OLS regressions, where the weights consist of the population size 6 in each municipality. The regression results for both consumption and life expectancy are reported in Table 5.

Note: Numbers in parenthesis are t-values. When t-values are numerically larger than 2, we will consider the coefficient to be statistically significant, corresponding to a confidence level of 95%. The results at the bottom of the table show that just these four explanatory variables (temperature, precipitation, education and urbanization rates) explain 92 percent of the variation in consumption levels between the municipalities in Bolivia. This is an extremely good fit, which suggests that we have included the most important explanatory variables, and that including additional variables would make little difference. The same four variables only explain about 74 percent of the variation in life expectancy, which is less impressive, but still very good for a cross-section model. Education is by far the most important variable, explaining about 88 percent of the variation in consumption levels and about 54 percent of the variation in life expectancy. Urbanization rates are also significant in both regressions, in a non-linear manner that suggests that the optimal urbanization rate is around 70 percent for consumption and about 50 percent for life expectancy. The temperature variables are highly significant in explaining consumption, but not life expectancy. Precipitation is not significant in any of the regressions. As it is difficult to assess the non-linear effects of temperature directly by looking at the estimated coefficients, we have plotted the estimated relationship in Figure 1. The axes are scaled to 7 represent the actual range of temperatures and consumption levels in different Bolivian municipalities, so that the magnitude of climate impacts can be seen in the appropriate perspective. A 95% confidence interval on the temperature-consumption relationship is also indicated in the graph. Figure 1: Estimated short-term relationship between temperature and consumption levels in Bolivia Consumption per capita (PPA-$/Year) 2245 1745 1245 745 245 3 5 7 9 11 13 15 17 19 21 23 25 27 Average annual temperature ( C) The estimated relationship indicates that Bolivians do considerably better in hot areas than in cold areas, even when controlling for other factors such as education attainment and urbanization levels. Inhabitants in the hottest regions are able to consume almost twice as much as inhabitants in the coldest regions. The slope is decreasing with temperature, suggesting that already hot areas would benefit only little in terms of consumption from additional increases in temperature, whereas presently cold areas would benefit more. Having established that temperature has an important effect on consumption possibilities in Bolivia, we will now proceed to test whether there have been any significant changes in temperatures in Bolivia during the last 6 decades. 4. Recent climate change in Bolivia In this section we will analyze climate data from the 18 meteorological stations of highest quality in Bolivia from May 1948 to May 2008 to test whether there are any significant trends, and whether these trends differ between regions. 8 The actual measured temperatures are first converted into temperature anomalies, by subtracting the average ""normal"" temperature for each station-month, as calculated for the reference period 1960-90. All the temperature anomaly series are plotted in Figure A1 in the Appendix. Once we have the series of temperature anomalies, it is straightforward to test whether there is a significant trend. This is done by regressing the anomaly on a trend-variable which has been scaled so that the coefficient can be directly interpreted as temperature change per decade in degrees Celsius. We use a confidence level of 95 percent to decide whether the trend is statistically significant, which means that the P-value of the trend coefficient should be less than 0.05 for the trend to be significant. Table 6 shows the estimated trends in temperatures for each of the 18 stations in Bolivia. Of these, four stations show significant warming since the middle of the previous century and nine show no significant change, and 5 show significant cooling. None of the stations in Bolivia get even close to having observations for all the 721 months in the 1948-2008 period, but some stations have reported more consistently than others. If we limit ourselves to the 15 stations that have at least 400 observations, we find that three show significant warming, four show significant cooling, and eight show no significant trend. A similar distribution is found if we limit ourselves to the 11 stations that have at least 500 observations. 9 The patterns of warming/cooling show a distinct geographical distribution, with the highland stations in the southwestern part of Bolivia showing consistent cooling, and the lowland areas to the north and east showing slight warming (see Map 1). This is consistent with NCDC data from neighboring countries, which show cooling in many parts of Peru and Chile but warming in Brazil (see Andersen, Suxo & Verner, 2009; Andersen & Verner 2009; and Andersen, Rom n & Verner, 2009).  Since the data from any single station is subject to idiosyncratic influences, it is necessary to average over several stations in order to get reliable results. In the case of Bolivia, the data suggests that highland areas in general have experienced cooling over the last 60 years, with an average trend around -0.2 C/decade. For the purposes of the simulations in the next section, we will therefore assume a uniform cooling trend of 0.2 C/decade for all municipalities located in the departments of Tarija, Chuquisaca, Potos , Oruro and the highland areas of La Paz (above 2000 meters above sea level). 10 For the lowland areas the evidence shows mostly no significant trends, but interspersed with a few positive trends. For the purposes of the simulations in the next section, we will assume a slight warming trend of 0.05 C/decade in all lowland areas. The general cooling of the highlands appears to be inconsistent with the rapid melting of several Bolivian glaciers (especially the Chacaltaya and the Zongo glaciers close to El Alto, see Francou et al, 2000 and Ramirez et al, 2001), but it is not. First of all, the glaciers have been melting continuously since the Little Ice Age (about 1550 to 1850), with only a brief slowdown during the relatively cool period of 1950-1980, and it is normal for melting to accelerate towards the end (just like a small ice cube melts faster than a big ice cube). In addition, glaciers depend on other factors than temperature, notably precipitation, but also cloud cover, relative humidity and the intensity of solar irradiation (Ramirez, 2008). A study of oxygen isotope series generated from ice cores from two Bolivian glaciers suggests that precipitation has decreased steadily since about 1974 (Hoffman et al, 2003)2. The reduction in precipitation is likely associated with the general reduction in cloud cover over the tropics since measurements began in the early 1980s3, and less clouds means more intense solar irradiation, which accelerates glacial melt. Decreased cloud cover at this altitude also works to amplify the diurnal temperature range, increasing daytime temperatures (which would cause increased melting), but reducing night-time temperatures even more (because of the missing cloud-blanket), which explains the reduction in average temperatures. Moreover, upon closer inspection of the temperature data, it becomes clear that temperatures have not fallen equally throughout the year. At the El Alto station, for example, summer temperatures have been increasing and winter temperatures decreasing (see Figure 2). Since winter is the dry season in El Alto, the lower winter temperatures will provide little benefit for the glaciers, which cannot accumulate mass without snowfall. Instead, these glaciers are much more sensitive to changes in summer temperatures and precipitation. This explains why the ENSO (El Ni o-Southern Oscillation) has such a strong effect on Bolivian glaciers. During ENSO's warm and dry phase (El Ni o), the mass balances are always negative, implying shrinking glaciers. In the cooler and more humid La Ni a phase, the glaciers return to equilibrium and sometimes show a small increase. The increase in the glacier regression rate since the end of the 1970s appears to coincide with the Pacific shift of 1976, the date after which the El Ni o event became more frequent and more intense (Ramirez et al, 2001). It was the unusually strong El Ni o event of 1997/98, which caused the permanent closing of the World's highest ski-resort on the Chacaltaya glacier. 2 However, this decrease is not considered unusual in a historical context and over the whole 20th century the isotope index is stable 3 According to NASA's International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project ISCCP (http://isccp.giss.nasa.gov/index.html ), average tropical cloud cover has decreased from about 66% in the 19080s to about 61% in the first 8 years of this century. The solid black line is a 30 day moving average of daily temperature anomalies. The colder winters in the already cold highlands could potentially have an adverse effect on the predominantly poor and indigenous population who inhabit the Bolivian highlands, since one of their main worries and limitations on agricultural productivity is frost (Gonzales Iwanciw, Cusicanqui Giles & Aparicio Effen, n.d.). This is the hypothesis that we will formally test and quantify in the following section. We have adequate precipitation data for 19 meteorological stations in Bolivia. The precipitation anomalies for each station have been plotted in Figure A2 in the Appendix. Table 7 below shows the results of a simple trend regression for each station. Using a confidence level of 95 percent we find that only five out of the 19 stations have experienced a significant trend in precipitation over the last six decades, and all of them experienced increases. Oruro in the highlands saw a slight increase of about 1.6 mm/decade, whereas Rurrenabaque, Santa Cruz/El Trompillo, Tarija and Trinidad saw somewhat larger increases. Since precipitation was not significant in the models of human development estimated in the previous section, it is not very important what we assume about precipitation trends in the simulation exercises in the next section. Only one station in the highlands showed a significant trend, and it was only a very small increase, so it is reasonably to assume that in general there have been no systematic changes in precipitation in the highlands. Trinidad in the lowlands showed a substantial increasing trend of about 15 mm/decade. But upon closer inspection of the anomalies (see Figure 3 below), it becomes clear that all of this increase took place before 1978, after which the trend has been negative. Thus, what sometimes appears as a statistically significant trend is really more of a natural cycle. We will therefore assume no systematic trends in precipitation in the lowlands either.

Simulating the impacts of recent climate change In this section, we will use the consumption model estimated in Section 2 to simulate the impact of the climate change experienced during the last 50 years, as indicated by the analysis in Section 3. We will compare two scenarios, one with Climate Change, which is the factual scenario, and one with No Climate Change, which is the counterfactual scenario. The temperatures in the Climate Change scenario, ti,CC, are the actual temperatures, whereas the temperatures in the counterfactual scenario, ti,NCC, are the temperatures that would have been if temperatures had not changed during the last 50 years. That is, for all highland municipalities temperatures are 1 C higher in the No Climate Change scenario compared to the Climate Change scenario, whereas for all lowland municipalities temperatures are 0.25 C lower in the No Climate Change scenario. As there has been no systematic change in precipitation, the precipitation terms cancel out, and the other factors, education and urbanization rates, we will maintain constant, so as to isolate the climate change effect. After estimating this ratio for each municipality, it is straightforward to calculate the percentage change in consumption levels that can be attributed to climate change. At the national level, the model estimates that climate change during the last 50 years has caused a reduction in consumption of about 1.3 percent. Table 8 shows the results disaggregated at the state level. The most disadvantaged states are the highland states Oruro, Potos and La Paz, which are estimated to have lost almost 3 percent of their consumption capacity due to the already cold climates becoming colder. Chuquisaca and Tarija have also lost out according to this simulation, but a bit less, as they were initially warmer, and the slope of the temperature/consumption relationship was thus less steep. All lowland states have gained slightly. Table 8: Effects of recent climate change on consumption levels, by state Effects of past temperature changes on consumption levels State (% change) Beni 0.16 Chuquisaca -1.74 Cochabamba 0.54 La Paz -2.44 14 Oruro -3.04 Pando 0.16 Potos -2.70 Santa Cruz 0.26 Tarija -1.59 BOLIVIA -1.33 Source: Author's estimations. Figure 4 shows the estimated effects of recent climate change on per capita consumption levels in all 311 municipalities. The municipalities are grouped in winners and losers, with no municipality being entirely unaffected. The winners are all lowland municipalities, representing 51 percent of the population. The losers are all highland municipalities, representing about 49 percent of the Bolivian population.  There is a weak but statistically significant positive relationship ( = 0.28) between initial level of consumption and the estimated effects of past climate change."""
21;"""Valuing Mortality Attributable to Climate Change in Argentina 1. Introduction Climate change represents a major threat to human beings and other forms of life on our planet. The potential impact of climate change on the social and environmental determinants of health outcomes is at the heart of both scientific and policy making efforts. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that climate change is expected to cause approximately a quarter million additional deaths per year worldwide between 2030 and 2050 due to climate-sensitive diseases as, malnutrition, diarrhoea, malaria and heat stress (WHO 2022). Presently, the global mean temperature is approximately 1.1 degree Celsius above the pre-industrial (1850-1900) era (WMO 2021). There is strong agreement among scientists in the research community regarding the human influence on the observed and predicted changes in temperature and precipitation patterns. Compared to 18501900, global surface temperature averaged over 20812100 is very likely to be higher by 2.1C to 3.5C in the intermediate GHG emissions scenario (SSP24.5) and by 3.3C to 5.7C under the very high GHG emissions scenario (SSP5-8.5) (Zhongming et al. 2021). Understanding the effects that extreme temperatures could have on human health is key to promote both effective adaptation policies to rising temperatures from climatic change, and mitigation policies around the planet. The potential impacts of weather changes on mortality are usually divided in two categories: direct effects (i.e., those produced by temperature increases) and indirect effects arising mainly from changes in vector-borne diseases and food security or increases in weather-related natural disasters. There are in fact other indirect impacts: it is known that weather tends to affect economic growth, energy consumption, agricultural production, labor productivity and pollution levels and all those impacts would likely produce a feedback effect towards worse health (Deschnes & Greenstone 2011). Across the literature, some articles limit themselves to study the present sensitivity of mortality at different temperature levels (e.g. Otrachshenko et al. 2017, for Russia) and others study also temperature mortality aspects due to climate change (e.g., Deschnes & Greenstone 2011 or A. I. Barreca 2012for the US; Burgess et al. 2017 for India; or Yu et al. 2019 for China). The few articles that study climate change impacts on mortality use some of IPCC greenhouse gases emissions scenarios projections (Representative Concentration Pathways: RCP2.6, RCP4.5, RCP6.0 or RCP8.51) o alternative scenarios. For example, Yu et al. (2019) consider two extreme pathways, RCP2.6 and RCP8.5, whereas Burgess et al. (2017) take the Hadley CM3 A1F1 scenario that authors affirm corresponds to a business-as-usual trajectory, and Deschenes (2018) follow the CCSME3 A2 scenario. A U-relationship between thermal ambient levels and mortality has been extensively documented in the literature. The causal effect of temperature on mortality rates is usually non-linear. That is the reason why nonparametric models estimated by ordinary least squares have been widely applied (Basu 2009). There are several alternatives to account for nonlinearity: log linear functions (e.g., Curriero et al. 2002); polynomial functions (Basu & Samet 2002); splines, which are piecewise polynomial functions (e.g., Kaiser et al. 2007; Doyon et al. 2008; A. I. Barreca 2012; A. I. Barreca & Shimshack 2012); or, bins (Deschnes & Greenstone 2011; Otrachshenko et al. 2017; Deschenes 2018; Yu et al. 2019, among others). Bins are among the alternatives more widely used in the literature to capture the non-linear relationship between temperature and mortality rates. They arise from discretizing the temperature in parts. The binned result is in terms of the time unit selected. For example, if daily temperatures in a month within a year are used, then the marginal effect for a given bin is the additional effect of one more day for which the temperature falls into that bin. The main advantage of bins over the other ways of capturing non-linearity is that they offer a very flexible functional form that allow each temperature bin to have a different impact on mortality. In addition, since most of the recent papers in economics use bins, we follow that same approach to ease the comparison.2 As highlighted by several authors as Deschenes (2014) or Son et al. (2019), even when we restrict our review to those articles that use bins, it is not easy to compare the results because of several reasons. There are many differences among studies related to: the units of measurement of mortality rates and weather conditions as well as on valuation methodologies. First, in general with respect to deaths, since heat or cold related illnesses are not coded separately under the International Classification of Diseases, studies typically relate all-causes mortality to ambient measures of weather. In addition, some articles use monthly mortality (A. I. Barreca 2012, for example), while others use yearly mortality rates (Deschnes & Greenstone 2011; Otrachshenko et al. 2017; Yu et al. 2019, among others), and only a few use daily mortality (Cohen & Dechezleprtre 2019). Second, in what concerns meteorological conditions, temperature and precipitations are the most usual control variables included in the empirical studies. For temperatures, there is no homogeneous definition of what cold day or hot day is and so each of the studies divides temperature bins differently.3 Since the mortality risk is expected to change with the level of temperature, comparisons loose precision. Another aspect is that most articles use mean temperature (e.g., A. I. Barreca 2012; Deschnes & Greenstone 2011, among others), and only in few cases, minimum or maximum temperatures are also considered for the regressions (e.g., Yu et al. 2019 or Cohen & Dechezleprtre 2019). Another variable that is something included in mortality-weather regressions is humidity (A. I. Barreca 2012). Other authors combine temperature and humidity in a heat index to capture Apparent temperature (Yu et al. 2019) and the results only change slightly. According to the review performed by Deschenes (2014, p. 609), adding precipitation or humidity do not lead to meaningful changes in model estimates compared to models that only control for temperatures. Yu et al. (2019) also find that the change in mortality estimates after including humidity in the model are almost negligible. Third, once mortality impacts are calculated, a few articles estimate the annual total of years of life lost (Deschenes & Moretti 2009; Burgess et al. 2017; Cohen & Dechezleprtre 2019). To do that implies leaving aside monetary valuation,4 and differentiate life years lost depending on each age group life expectancy. To avoid valuation is not free of problems. As Deschnes & Greenstone 2011, p.183) explicitly state, people dying from extreme weather may not be the median citizen and so his/her life expectancy will like likely be lower than that of the average citizen. Another thing that may happen is that life expectancies may vary along time and that shift is not considered in this type of calculation. Moving beyond life-years impacts requires an economic assessment. There are articles that use the present value of foregone earnings of a death among working population, which requires to know deaths by age group, income by age as well as labour force participation (Otrachshenko et al. 2017). This perspective is what is known as the human capital approach, and as such constitutes a lower bound, since productivity lost is only a component of the value of a statistical life, there are also utility losses when a life ends. Hence, present value of lost income neglects the value of leisure time and important subjective aspects and focuses only on pecuniary impacts of death. The full willingness derives from what is known as the Value of a Statistical Life (VSL) estimates.5,6 In this case, an option could be to assign the same value of a statistical life -VSL- for all age groups, another would be to calculate the value of a statistical life per year (VSLY), which allow a differentiation of the value of life for people in different age groups since expected remaining years up to life expectancy varies by age group. Deschnes & Greenstone (2011) lead these types of estimations since it uses two alternatives: one is to assign a fixed value of a statistical life-year of $100,000 for the different years lost due to deaths in each age group and the other allows for the value of statistical life-year to be adjusted over time by a real per capita income growth of 2% per year and an elasticity of the value of the statistical life-year to income of 1.6. In any of those cases, as we will show in the next Section, the value can come from local data or from a transfer valuation adjusted by relative income and by the elasticity of VSL to income or both. Although the existing studies use a variety of periods, models, mortality indicators, meteorological variables, the number and size of the weather bins, the reference bins, and ways to value, the great majority of publications find that temperature extremes lead to significant reductions in mortality. This assessment can be made more precise if we illustrate that with a few of those articles that use temperature bins with panel data and so are clearly related to our work. Deschnes & Greenstone (2011) is representative of numerous studies for the US on mortalitytemperature links. The authors find, for the 1968 to 2002 period, that an additional day with a mean temperature exceeding 90 F leads to an increase in annual age-adjusted mortality rate of 0.11% per cent with respect to the one within the 50-60 F interval. Similarly, a day with temperatures below 20 F is associated with an increase in annual mortality between 0.07 and 0.08 per cent. When they take account for climate change, they estimate that mortality will increase 3 per cent by the end of the century. Otrachshenko et al. (2017) analyze the case of Russia in the 1989-2014 period and find that one extra day with temperatures above 25 C with respect to the 20-25 C range increase yearly mortality by 0.06%, whereas an additional day with low temperature (below -30 C) only decreases annual mortality by 0.01% and is not significant.7 Using the present value of foregone income of working population, the authors estimate that an extra day of heat (cold) implies damages equivalent to 0.28% (0.22%) of daily Russian GDP. Burgess et al. (2017) study the case of India for the 1957-2000 period and compare it to same results for the US. They find that 1 additional day over 95 F with respect to the 70-74 F bin in India increases annual mortality by 0.74% when that increase for the US is of 0.03% for the same years. Yu et al. (2019) find for China between 2014-2012, that an extra day of heat (over 90 F) over the 5060 F level increases annual mortality rate by 0.6%, whereas an extra day of cold (less than 10 F) increases that mortality rate by 0.3%. The authors also show that climate change raises yearly mortality rates in 2.4% and 14.2% in scenarios RCP2.6 and 8.5 respectively. Using the VSL for China, the authors estimate climate change damages that account for 0.21% and 1.19% depending on two climate scenario projection. In addition to the overall mortality result, the literature also discusses factors affecting vulnerability to temperature levels (Hajat & Kosatky 2010; Deschenes 2014; Benmarhnia et al. 2015; Son et al. 2019). One of the clearer ones is age. Elderly are known to face higher risks from cold and heat, which may be due to physiological conditions, housing or health access conditions as well as behavioral characteristics.8 Findings suggest higher mortality impact from temperature levels in less qualified employees, among black population and unmarried persons (Son et al. 2019). Other individual-level modifiers as gender or education do not yield conclusive results, whereas lower income individuals tend to be more affected by temperature extremes.9 The literature analyses other determinants that have to do with community characteristics rather than individual ones. In that sense, there is weak evidence for higher heat related mortality associated with higher population density, poor housing facilities, and higher pollution levels. Additional factors, but also with unsubstantial evidence, are higher risks for heat: in urban areas; in communities with warmer climate; places with less proportion of green areas; etc. Some few studies also report higher vulnerability to cold weather: in regions with warmer climate, in places located in lower latitudes and in rural areas (Burgess et al. 2017). In an attempt to take into account those community factors, it is usual to find studies within this literature that test for regional subsamples (A. I. Barreca 2012 and Deschnes & Greenstone 2011) for different regions in the US; Yu et al. (2019) for different regions in China). From the available literature reviews, it is possible to conclude that, except for the age factor, the rest of the determinants of temperature-mortality sensitivity are location and population sensitive, from where the importance of performing local studies. This study makes two novel contributions. Firstly, it adds to the limited existing literature on climatic determinants of mortality in developing countries and in Argentina. A literature review on temperaturerelated mortality between 1980 and 2017, Son et al. (2019) show that most of the studies focus on North America, Europe and Asia, and many nations, including most in Latin America and Asia, had no studies. Argentina is an interesting case in its own right because it has a vast territory with diverse weather. The wide range of altitudes, that go from high mountains along the Andes plains on the Atlantic coast, contribute to that diversity.10 The weather is mild in the Pampas, cold in the western Patagonia, subtropical in the Mesopotamia region, and warm in the Northeast. Along the Andes (located in the West), are the coldest areas, with dry and snowy weather. A few studies have documented the influence of weather on human mortality in Argentina. Of those, the ones that are closers to our work are Almeira et al. (2016), which reports a U-shaped relationship between temperature and mortality for the cities of Buenos Aires and Rosario, and de Garn & Bejarn (2003), that examines the effect of thermal stress during summertime (characterized by the relative strain index) on mortality rates in Buenos Aires city. 11,12 Although very informative, none of the existing work relating weather conditions and health in Argentina perform any economic valuation and this is our first contribution. Secondly, we provide estimates of the incidence of climate change on mortality (and not only for the link between temperature and death rates). We do for the whole country (i.e., a sizable portion of the population), breaking the analysis by age and gender groups and using state-of-the-art panel data econometrics. Third, we value mortality damages. In a context of climatic change, where resources must be allocated to promote adaptation to the new climate, comparable countrywide estimates of health impacts and the corresponding damages are indeed needed to develop a rational and sustainable adaptation policy. The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section II describes the empirical strategy implemented to value mortality impacts due to temperature variations. Section III describes the data. Section IV shows the estimation results in terms of mortality rate changes, consequent deaths and valuation of those impacts, as well as the robustness checks we perform. The last section V summarizes our findings, the policy consequences they have and discusses the limitations of our results. 2. Empirical strategy The empirical strategy involves four different steps for the case of Argentina. First, estimate a model that relates daily temperature in a recent period with the corresponding mortality rates. Second, calculate the change in temperature according to climate change projections. Third, estimate deaths attributable to extreme temperatures in the benchmark period as well as the ones resulting from climate change. Fourth, value deaths using the value of a statistical life. 2.1. Benchmark model Our benchmark model is described by the following equation: 6 =1 4  = 0+   + +++ =1 [1] where  is the mortality rate per 100,000 inhabitants in municipality or district d (which belong to a given state or province) in month m in year t for a give age-group a.  is the number of days in each district d per month m per year t that fall in each temperature bin j, and  is the number of days in each district d per month m per year t that fall in each precipitation bin j. As in several articles in this literature (Deschnes & Greenstone 2011; Deschenes 2018), the temperature range was divided in 10 degrees Fahrenheit (F) bins.13 The temperature bin taken as the reference is the one of 70-80 F (21.1-26.6 C), that corresponds to the mode of the frequency distribution of days in a month that fall into each of the bins. Then,  stands for month time effects that allow controlling for potentially confounding effects common to all municipalities that vary overtime, for example macroeconomic shocks affecting the countrywide economic performance, which might affect health outcomes. Finally,  is an interaction term, which captures temporal variations between municipalities due to differences in air quality, income levels, educational attainment, and population density. Thus, these fixed effects could be interpreted as a baseline estimate of mortality rates in each municipality (Barreca & Shimshack 2012). Finally,  is an error term. Note that we use the monthly mortality to avoid the so-called harvesting effect: i.e., we try to avoid the temporal displacement of deaths that occur that after a period of more deaths than expected because of the heat, follows a period of mortality deficit because it is likely that heat wave especially affected those whose health weak and so would have died in the short-term anyway. If less than a month was considered, we would likely overestimate the impact of temperature on mortality. Our main estimate for the calculation of damages is in , which can be read as the change in MR with respect to the MR in the temperature bin of reference, when the number of days in each of the other temperature bins varies by 1:  =    , with  = 1 Hence,  =   [2] Since the final unit of analysis is municipality (d) by month (m) in a given year (t), there will be a  for each age-group (a) for each temperature bin (j):  . More specifically, we ran a model for all age groups and both genders, then, we estimate four regressions, one for each age group. In addition, we run alternative specifications. Finally, we perform some robustness check with the model including temperature and precipitation interactions; using the logarithm of the mortality rate; and, using monthly lagged bins. 13 The precipitation range was partitioned in five bins of 4 millimeters (mm) of rain. 2.2. Climate change estimation With the different values for   obtained from equation [1], we estimate how climate change modifies in each district d the number of days in a given month m of a certain year t that fall within each bin j (), using climate scenarios for temperature change predictions for the future as compared to the present period. With those two inputs in hand, the change in the mortality rates due to the modification in the number of days that fit within each bin results from:  =    [3] More specifically, what is calculated to fulfil the objective of this work is the change in the mortality rates due to the shift in the number of extreme cold (c), heat (h) days, and both extreme types of weather (e), as:    =   =     =    +   [3] Note that c (for cold) corresponds to j = bin <40 F (<4.4 C), whereas h (for hot) is j = bin > 90 F (> 32.2 C). 2.3. Number of deaths due to extreme temperature and its change Based on the changes in mortality rate from [2] and [3], we calculate the number of deaths that result from each of three circumstances (changes in cold days, heat days, and both extreme temperature days). First, we calculate the number of deaths for the whole country resulting from an extra day within each of the bins with respect to the deaths occurring at the reference temperature bin based on equation [2],  =      12  2010 100 000   [4] Where  is the change in the number of deaths in age-group a for each additional day of temperature within each bin j,  are the estimated coefficients for average monthly mortality rate from equation [1], 12 are the number of months in a year (this converts monthly mortality to annual mortality),  2010 is the population of group a in 2010 (it is divided by 100 000 because   is the  is an average per  in 100 000), and  is the number of districts in Argentina (because  district that has to be converted to a national estimate,  = 511.14 Second, to get the change in the number of deaths attributable to each bin temperature per year, we multiply [4] by the average number days in each bin per month during the period used for the estimation of the benchmark model (and then by 12, the number of months in a year):  =    100 000 Third, we estimate the number of deaths attributable to the change in the number of days within each bin following equation [3] as:  =       12  2010 100 000   [6] As it is clear from equations [4]- [6], overall, the total effect of climate change on deaths varies by the population within each age-group in the whole country and depends on the sensitivity of mortality to colder and hotter periods, on the number of cold and hot days in a year, and on how this changes when the distribution of temperature shift as the result of climate change. The economic valuation of such effects is the only step that remains. 2.4. Mortality damages attributable to temperature extremes and their change Finally, the  calculated in equations [4]- [6] are valued here using the value of a statistical life. Even when there are non-market methods to assess the VSL as we mentioned above, they involve detailed data and sophisticated techniques, which require resources and knowledge. This may explain why there are relatively few estimates of VSL for low and middle- income countries, as this is widely acknowledged in the literature (see Robinson 2017, among others). However, there is an estimation of the VSL in Argentina (Picassso and Conte Grand 2019). The estimation is not in the context of health but of crime. However, we use it as an alternative because it is obtained with local data. To cover the uncertainty surrounding that applicability of that VSL for this case, we opt for an alternative: transfer values from studies in other countries. Based on them, we adjust VSL from other places (policy site: denoted by p) to Argentina, which is location of the study (s) relative per capita income (  VSL income elasticity (), as it is usual in the literature (Brouwer 2000) following:  ) and the  = (   ) [7] 3. Data The first part of our estimation strategy outlined above relies on data for the 2010-2019 period:15 death counts by administrative subdivision and weather records from meteorological stations Argentinean data. Then, for the second part of our empirical methodology, climate change is captured through the difference between 2010 (the year within the interval that corresponds to the last census done in Argentina) and 2085 distributions of temperature for Argentina as described in the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP). 3.1. Mortality rate The mortality data correspond to the universe of over 4 million deaths across the country in the period, as compiled by the Direccin de Estadsticas e Informacin Pblica, the agency in charge of the National System of Health Statistics. The dataset reports each death along with the date of death, the gender and age, and the municipality of residence of the deceased. Thus, death counts were aggregated at the municipal level, the smallest administrative subdivision in the dataset. Death counts were supplemented with annual population estimates to construct monthly municipal mortality rates per 100,000 inhabitants, by gender and age-groups. Specifically, following Deschnes and Greenstone (2011) and Barreca et al. (2016), the population was stratified into four age groups (0-4, 5-44, 45-64, >64-year-olds).16 Annual population numbers by municipality had to be interpolated from the 2010 national population census. Average mortality rates are (per 100,000) approximately 21 inhabitants for children under 5 years of age, 8 for people between 5 and 44 years of age, 58 for adults between 44 and 65, and 413 for older adults. One should expect to observe the greatest impacts of extreme temperatures in the last group, given that it generally includes the most vulnerable people. 3.2. Meteorological records Weather records were obtained from the Servicio Meteorolgico Nacional, the official national weather and climatological agency. Daily maximum and minimum temperatures in degree Celsius (C) as well as total precipitation in millimeters (mm) are reported for the 71 weather stations that comprise the National Weather Station Network. The monitoring network might seem to be sparse given the surface area and the degree of development of a country such as Argentina. However, according to the 2010 national census, the Argentinian population is mostly urban, with 91% living in towns bigger than 2,000 inhabitants, and half of the total population living in just 8 cities. Therefore, the 61 weather stations finally included in the analysis provide coverage to approximately 82% of the countrys population.17 Daily station data had to be spatially interpolated at the municipal level to construct monthly weather exposure variables. Following a common approach in the literature, square inverse distance weights were calculated from each municipal geographical centroid to each station within a 100 kilometers radius (Hanigan et al. 2006). Thus, the interpolated weather variables are simply the weighted average of the stations records within that radius (i.e., the closest monitoring station to a particular district is given more weight). Limiting the cut-off distance to 100 km was necessary to balance the number of municipalities included in the study while minimizing the potential measurement error that would otherwise be introduced by including distant stations. Despite districts were not included because of those reasons, they cover 84.9 per cent of Argentinas population. In general, monitoring stations are not located where population is scarce. Similar cut-off levels have been used in empirical estimates for the United States (Deschnes and Greenstone 2011; Barreca 2012; Barreca and Shimshack 2012; Ranson 2014; Barreca et al. 2016). Figure 1 show the municipalities included in the study along with the location of the 71 weather stations. 3.3. Climate change Climate change temperature data comes from the NASA Earth Exchange Global Daily Downscaled Projections (NEX-GDDP). That database has daily minimum and maximum temperature as well as precipitation for the whole planet. The temporal coverage is from 1950 to 2014 historical data and 2015 to 2100 projected Shared Socioeconomic Pathways: RCP-4.5 and RCP-8.5. The RCP 4.5 is a moderate scenario where some effort to curb climate change is made but temperatures rise 2.7C globally by the end of the century, whereas RCP-8.5 projects that the global economy grows fueled by exploiting fossil fuels and energy-intensive lifestyles and by 2100 the average global temperature is 4.4C higher. Note that the temperature by 2050 under the 8.5 scenarios would be similar to that of the 4.5 projection to the end of the century. The spatial resolution of NEX-GDDP is approximately 25 degrees x 25 degrees. We took the daily information for temperature available within the geographical limits of Argentina and average it for both 2010 and 2085.18 Then, as previously, the temperatures are assigned to each municipality. Figure 2 shows the shift in days within each temperature bin if the projected climate change takes place. What happens in that case is that, as expected, the average temperature increases and the number of cold days decreases while the number of hot days increases.19 Scenario 8.5, since it projects more climate change, shows a higher number of hot days than the 4.5 one. Those changes are not uniform across the whole country (Figure A. 2 in Appendix). 3.4. Valuation Finally, for the Value of a Statistical Life, we use an estimation for Argentina from Picasso and Conte Grand (2019) that to our knowledge is the only one derived from local data. In addition, for robustness check, we transfer the VSL from estimates in the US (Viscusi and Masterman 2017) and from a global study by the World Bank in association with the Institute of Health Metric and Evaluation (World Bank and IHME 2016). The local VSL is $1,5 million corresponding to 2014 (Table 1). The original US estimate is $9.6 million 2014 dollars, which transferred using the Argentina to US relative GDP per capita yields a value of $2.4 million.20 Similarly, the World Bank estimate for OECD countries is $3.8 million, which transferred to Argentina becomes $1.98 million. We update the estimates to 2019 dollars, which is the last year of our mortality data, and transfer them to Argentinas case adjusting by the relative GDP ratio among countries. Because of the uncertainty surrounding what is the best VSL, we perform a Montecarlo simulation. To do so, we assume a triangular distribution for VSL, with a minimum value, a maximum value and a mode of 1.2, 1.72 and 1.59 respectively.21 4. Results This section is divided in two subsections. The first shows the estimates for the mortality rate temperature impacts for the whole population, by age-groups in the 2010-2019 period. The second subsection uses the estimated relationships to predict the impacts on annual deaths due to temperature extremes, its variation due to climate changes, and their valuation. 4.1. Mortality rates The changes in mortality rates attributable to the 2010-2019 temperature profile are summarized in Figure 3. That figure presents the estimated exposure impacts computed by nonparametric regressions between mortality rates and temperature at the municipal level, controlling for precipitation levels and fixed effects by month and municipality-by-month (i.e., equation [1]) for all age-groups, genders, and regions. The results must be interpreted as the relative impact of daily mean temperature over annual mortality due to an additional day in a given month with temperature above or below the observed mode temperature bin during the 2010-2019 period (i.e., the 70-80 F or 21.1-26.6 C bin). Any day with a mean daily temperature above the reference temperature positively and significantly affects mortality rates. Days in the extreme cold temperatures (<40 F bin) also shows a significant excess mortality with respect to the reference temperature. The U shape is usual in the literature (Deschenes and Greenstone 2011, for example). But, the U is not always perfectly symmetric. As Figure 3 suggests, for Argentina, the estimated impacts of colder-thanaverage temperatures are slightly higher than the computed estimates for hotter than average temperatures. In other countries as Mexico, the higher impacts are also associated to cold and slightly below mean temperature days rather than to heat (Cohen and Dechezlepretre 2020).22 More precisely, a cold day (average temperature below 10 C) cause 3.5 fives more excess mortality than a heat day The last row of Panel A in Table 2 shows the same result as Figure 3 in a more detailed way. On average, an additional day with a relative cold day, one with a countrywide mean temperature between 30 and 40 F (<-4.4 C) increases the population-weighted average monthly mortality rate in 0.633 each 100,000 inhabitants with respect to the mortality for a day with the reference temperature, and that increase is significant. On the other side, an extra relatively hot day (> 90 F or 32.2 C) significantly increases that mortality rate by 0.515 in 100,000."""
22;"""Delivering for People and the Planet: Human Capital, Gender and Climate Change Climate change is eroding human capital across the life cycle, hurting peoples potential, and affecting men, women, and vulnerable groups in different ways. Promoting green, resilient, and inclusive development requires addressing gender, human capital, and climate priorities together. The World Bank Group is supporting countries to invest in human capital, including the poor and the vulnerable, as well as women, to increase their resilience to a changing climate. By investing in human capital and promoting gender equality, countries can provide their people with the skills and abilities to drive climate mitigation, meet the demands of the green economy and ensure a just transition for all. The Challenge Climate change is eroding human capital at all stages of life, with long-lasting implications for peoples well-being and economic productivity. Climate shocks reinforce pre-existing poverty traps, threaten to increase poverty levels, and deepen inequalities globally. i Shocks early in life affect a childs wellbeing and impact productivity in adulthood. Extreme heat, for example, is directly linked to increased hospitalization during pregnancy, chronic and acute malnutrition in early childhood, lower test scores amongst school-age children, a global loss of 470 billion work hours among adults in 2021, as well as over 300,000 deaths of people over 65 in 2019. ii Many of these impacts constrain economic potential and affect men and women in different ways. For women, the impacts of climate change are clearest in their economic activities. Women are more likely to earn a living from natural resource-based or climate-vulnerable sectors. While both men and women will be affected, pre-existing inequities may cause women to benefit less from the growth in green jobs as economies decarbonize without deliberate, inclusive policies. Human capital investment and gender-sensitive policies offer the opportunity to mitigate the impacts of climate change, build adaptive capacity, and harness the skills needed for a green and inclusive economy. If tackled strategically, the transition to a low-carbon economy offers a chance to dismantle current inequities in the labor markets and create human capital gains from reduced air pollution and other environmental co-benefits. Withstanding climate-induced setbacks to human capital and supporting the climate transition with impactful investments in human capital will help realize the promise of productivity and green growth. What Is Needed? Action and increased investment are needed now to improve peoples adaptive capacity. Basic investment in education and healthcare build resilience as people with high levels of human capital have more tools to withstand shocks. Greater awareness of climate change can also spur behavioral change. iii Strong disaster risk management and disease surveillance systems, underpinned by robust data, are crucial to minimize adverse impacts and guide an appropriate policy response. iv Well-targeted social protection helps to ensure basic levels of consumption, protect people in times of crisis, encourage people to diversify into livelihoods that are less climate vulnerable, allow labor market transitions, and promote savings to guard against shocks. Investments in human capital will allow men and women to manage  and benefit from  the climate transition, while tackling current inequities. Job losses are expected in carbon-intensive industries but there are opportunities too.v World Bank research estimates that climate business can generate 213 million cumulative jobs around the world between 2020 and 2030.vi Investments in renewable electricity, energy efficiency, charging infrastructure for electric vehicles, green hydrogen supply chains, and climate smart urban transport systems can simultaneously both abate emissions and create jobs in a cost-effective manner. However, these sectors require strong technical skills. To enable poor countries  and poor people globally  to reap the benef its of the transition to a low-carbon economy, education and skills curricula will need to provide job-relevant skills for new opportunities, for example in renewable energy, as well as research in climate change innovation through increased R&D.vii The transition to greener jobs also provides an opportunity to reduce economic gender gaps by overcoming social norms around traditionally male-dominated sectors, promoting womens STEM skills, and expanding access to childcare. Climate-proofing and decarbonizing human development service delivery protects critical services and promotes green solutions. Globally, the health sector contributes an estimated five percent of national emissions. Health service reform can deliver mitigation through energy efficiency and decarbonization of energy supplies. Resource efficient health centers, schools and other social service delivery infrastructure will lower emissions and increase system resilience to limit the interruption of health, education, and social protection services during climate shocks. In all policy areas, successful climate action requires involving people in the reform process to ensure a just transition. The green transition will create winners and losers in the labor market. Meaningful consultation and labor policies will help build social support for climate policies, ensure that programs better meet peoples human capital needs, while also improving climate outcomes. Womens empowerment and leadership are central to effective climate action  associated with better resource governance, conservation outcomes, disaster readiness, and the adoption of more climate-friendly decisions in the private sector. How is the World Bank Group Contributing to Solutions? The World Bank Group (WBG) is investing in human capital to protect people from the adverse impacts of climate change; to build their resilience and capacity to adjust during the transition; and to use their human capital to driveand thrive ina low-carbon economy. WBG green investments also connect human capital and gender across the key systems of energy; agriculture, food, water, and land; cities; transport; and manufacturing. Protect The World Bank supports countries to protect people from the worst impacts of climate change. Adaptive social protection and climate-smart health and education systems build resilience and mitigate climate shocks. Upstream capacity to respond effectively and quickly in times of crises minimizes negative impacts and can reduce gender vulnerability. As of June 2022, the World Bank had financed social protection programs in 60 countries, including $17 billion in the worlds poorest countries. Many of these programsKenya, the Philippines, the Sahel region, Senegal, Sierra Leone, and Solomon Islands, to name a fewfocus on building adaptive social protection systems as well as resilience programs for women. ix Such programs in Niger, for example, increased beneficiary incomes by 60 to 100 percent. Similarly, a $500 million Development Policy Operation in Morocco aims to improve protection against health risks, human capital losses during childhood, and poverty in old age as well as improving climate risk management and resilience. World Bank operations improve climate resilience of education and health systems. For example, in FY22 alone, World Bank-financed human development projects invested roughly $670 million in Djibouti, Ethiopia, The Gambia, and South Sudan to strengthen health systems with climate-smart design. The World Bank also supports projects for green and resilient school facilities, such as in Romania where education buildings serving 17,500 pupils will become more energy-efficient and resilient to climate-related hazards. The World Bank has developed analytics and assessment tools in the human development sectors to analyze the risks to and resilience of people and service delivery systems to inform climate-related investments. The Climate Health Vulnerability Assessment and Climate and Health and Economic Valuation Tool identify potential climate-related health shocks, outline their costs, and how to strengthen systems to respond to them. The Social Protection Stress Test has helped over 22 countries assess their readiness to scale up social protection in crises. A Skills Profiling and Transition Pathways diagnostic tool developed for Polands coal regions profiles worker skills and preferences to inform potential matching to alternative jobs. Also, a tool that will holistically assess the impacts of climate change on the human capital sectors is under development. Build The World Bank supports countries to build human capital for women and men to thrive in greener economies. People need a solid foundation in health and education to achieve their full potential. Strengthening the skills of women and excluded groups can promote inclusion, help unlock climate change innovations, and meet labor supply shortages. Social safety nets help poor people invest in the education and health of the next generation. Environmental education fosters foundational skills and behavior change for climate awareness and social resilience. In countries as diverse as Indonesia, Tonga, and Uganda, the World Bank supports reforms to school and teacher training curricula that create foundational knowledge on greenhouse gas reduction, changing patterns of rain and floods, emergency responses to cyclones and floods, thereby building resilience to disasters and climate change. Climate-smart education systems also develop skills necessary for climate mitigation. Technical and vocational training, research in climate change innovation in higher education, and establishing green centers of excellence can accelerate green economic transformation. In India, the World Bank financing supports competitive research grants in climate-related research and development. Several initiatives specifically aim to increase girls and womens education, including STEM, and expand opportunities to access green jobs. These include programs in Nepal and Pakistan. Multisectoral World Bank programs in climate-resilient nutrition are a foundational investment to build human capital. In the last five years, the World Bank has supported nutrition through health systems in Djibouti, India, Madagascar, Mozambique, Philippines, and Yemen. Social protection and education programs in Haiti, Honduras, and Somalia, among others, provide complementary services to improve nutrition. Use The World Bank Group helps reimagine how people live and work, adapting to and mitigating climate change. Green and just transitions require using human capital effectively and could increase womens employment in renewable technology. Diversification and adaptation in agriculture and livelihoods will be critical as people navigate the green economy. Social safety nets and labor market programs facilitate this transition, minimizing the risks of exploring new jobs and opportunities. The World Bank supports 157 Economic Inclusion programs that build resilience. x Spread mainly across low-income countries, these programs focus on improving resources management and green jobs. Working to facilitate a green transition for poor households, people receive reskilling, labor intermediation, or migrant services, as well as help in investing in sustainable agri-food value chains. The World Bank supports womens economic empowerment for a green transition. In South Asia, the Middle East, and North Africa, the World Bank partners with civil society, businesses, and donors to support womens labor force participation in water and clean energy, aiming to get more women into these value chains through investments in STEM, school to work transition, and childcare. IFCs Powered by Women program in Asia Pacific and Energy2Equal in Africa work with renewable energy companies on gender-smart solutions including hiring more women in leadership and technical roles. MIGA is engaged with private sector energy companies in Sub-Saharan Africa to help improve womens access to clean energy and their leadership and employment opportunities. World Bank analysis informs the just transition for all, with policy frameworks to help affected workers in India, Indonesia, Philippines, and South Africa.xi The World Bank is preparing to support workers at the Komati power plant with reskilling and upskilling, labor market programs to transition to new jobs, and connections with social protection programs. Green public works financed by the World Bank in Ethiopia, Fiji, Malawi, and Mozambique, among others, provide jobs for the poor while rebuilding ecosystems and reforesting communities. In 12 countries, World Bank operations enable indigenous and local women leaders to enhance income opportunities in and around forests, investing in local, sustainable, and socially inclusive enterprises to drive climate change solutions.xiii What Will Success Look Like? Success is putting people at the center of the climate change agenda, ensuring that policies capture the full costs and benefits to people. Proactive citizen engagement around national climate policies will enhance the likelihood that countries can achieve their goals. WBG tools will help governments quantify the costs and opportunities of climate reforms to peoples health, education, jobs, and overall well-being to inform evidenced-based policy making. Governments should have the support they need to ensure that their human capital policies and programs are effectively financed to meet the needs of the green, resilient, inclusive economy and to integrate gender equality. Climate adaptation should focus first on those people who are most affected by and vulnerable to climate change. There are many opportunities to deliver for both people and the planet. Green public works are just one example, providing income for poor households while improving the environment. Climate mitigation should meet peoples needs in the transition and build their capacity to drive a green economy. The just transition goes beyond compensation: affected workers need an appropriate mix of skills training, active labor market programs, mobility assistance, and/or economic rejuvenation programs. Building a new green economy requires healthy and skilled people to work in a myriad of new jobs and the time is now to ensure people are prepared for these opportunities."""
