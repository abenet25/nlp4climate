"Over the past two years, nine out of 10 countries have slid backwards on the UN's Human Development Index",media
"Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and the impact of climate change are blamed for putting global development in reverse",media
The Human Development Index was launched in 1990 in an effort to look beyond GDP as a measure of well-being,media
"Switzerland sits at the top of the index this year with a life expectancy of 84 years, an average of 16",media
"5 years spent in education and median salary of $66,000",media
"At the other end of the scale is South Sudan where life expectancy is 55, people spend just 5",media
5 years in school on average and earn $768 a year,media
"Setbacks in a majority of the 191 countries included in the index, especially in life expectancy, have taken development levels back to those seen in 2016, reversing a 30-year trend",media
"In the US, for example, life expectancy at birth has dropped by more than two years since 2019",media
In other countries the decline is much higher,media
"Over the years since the index was introduced, many countries have faced crises and slid backwards, but the global trend consistently moved upwards",media
Last year was the first time the index declined overall since calculations began and this year's results solidified that downward trend,media
The impact has been uneven though,media
Two-thirds of rich countries rebounded last year while most others continued to decline,media
This year's index is based on data from 2021,media
"""But the outlook for 2022 is grim,"" says Achim Steiner, one of its authors, who points out that more than 80 countries are facing problems paying off their national debt",media
"""Eighty countries being one step away from facing that kind of crisis is a very serious prospect,"" he says",media

"Much as climate change is accelerated by human behaviours, the impact of weather and climate events is influenced by societal structures",media
Disasters do not affect all people equally,media
"In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, an Oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3:1 in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India",media
"While no one cause was clear, there were similar patterns across the region",media
"Men were more likely to be able to swim, and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives",media
"Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger",media
"In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced",media

"com/five-ways-that-climate-change-threatens-human-health-242711 Link copied Share article As the UN’s climate summit, Cop29 , gets underway in Azerbaijan this week, the effect of climate change on human health is high on the agenda",media
"And rightly so, amid some alarming emerging statistics",media
"By the end of this century, climate change could be the cause of more than 3 million deaths per year (around five times as many annual deaths globally of HIV and Aids)",media
A new report from a scientific review committee of experts called the Lancet Countdown highlights how globally people are facing “record-breaking threats” to their health as a consequence of climate change,media
"The major climate risks include negative effects on food security (including production), spread of diseases, ecosystems, infrastructure and the economy",media
"Despite having contributed the least to global emissions, Africa will be most affected by climate change",media
This is due to the fragile economics and exposure to extreme weather events across much of the continent,media
"But all continents, including Europe , will be negatively affected",media
Everyone working in health needs to prepare for and be equipped to respond to the health consequences of the climate crisis,media
The Lancet highlights the opportunity “to redefine the social and environmental determinants of health”,media
These are the top five priorities when it comes to climate change and human health: 1,media
"New and emerging infectious diseases Drastic environmental change increases the risk of catching deadly infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue and West Nile virus in new areas",media
"Modelling shows that mosquito populations could move into different regions of Africa and South America, and into Europe",media
The parasitic ticks that transmit the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus may move north from Africa into Europe as climate change takes hold,media
"The threat of outbreaks of new and emerging infections, and pandemics, is increasing",media
"In 2022, the World Health Organization warned that Ebola outbreaks around Africa are becoming more frequent due to climate change, as bats – the likely source of the virus – migrate and seek new habitats to breed",media
"Infectious diseases are predicted to spread more easily due to climate change, and thus increase the risk of pandemics",media
"This threat includes Lassa fever, a virus thought to be transmitted by rats",media
"Modelling has indicated that the rats may flee fire and flood, find new habitats and thus expose greater numbers of humans to new or different viruses",media
Food security and nutrition Climate change exacerbates food insecurity,media
"In Ghana, West Africa, inconsistent rainfall during the 2024 rainy season has left an estimated 1",media
05 million people acutely food insecure,media
"This is the case particularly in the north of the country, an area already with a high level of food insecurity and hunger",media
"The UN predicts that more than 600 million people will be living in hunger by 2030, due to the impact of climate shocks and lack of aid and government action thus far",media
"Climate change worsens food insecurity from many different angles; from rural farmers in Ghana losing their crops due to unexpected changes in rainfall, to the impact of affordability of imports in the UK, there won’t be just hunger hotspots",media
"As food insecurity deteriorates, so will malnutrition globally",media
"By 2030, between 570,000 and 1 million children under five years old will suffer from stunted growth due to climate change, also exacerbating their vulnerability to infectious diseases such as malaria",media
Access to healthcare Extreme weather can physically prevent people from accessing healthcare,media
"Between 2014 and 2023, 61% of land globally experienced an increase in the number of days of extreme rainfall, compared to 1961-1990",media
"Flash floods have devastated Valencia in Spain, with health services anticipating increases in diarrhoea, skin infections and hepatitis A",media
"Evidence from Ghana shows that physical access to healthcare is restricted, with patients and sometimes health workers unable to reach local health centres, and emergency referrals unable to reach hospitals",media
Access to healthcare provision becomes harder during extreme weather conditions,media
Riccardo Mayer/Shutterstock The Lancet report also found that only two-thirds of countries had high or very high implementation of legally required health emergency plans,media
"This number needs to be 100% to protect population health as extreme weather events become more frequent, unpredictable and severe",media
Delays to reduce carbon emissions and attempt to rectify the situation are only adding to the issue,media
"Global energy-related carbon emissions reached a new high in 2023, showing little signs of slowing down",media
"In a 2023 study conducted in Mion (northern Ghana), nearly all participants reported not being able to access a healthcare facility when they needed to at least once, due to climatic conditions",media
"Similarly, in the Volta region in Ghana, many residents lost all their belongings during unexpected flooding in 2023 including health insurance documents",media
"This means people cannot access vital medications or services such as insulin if diabetic, or emergency care",media
"Air quality Air quality is one of the most locally-felt impacts of climate change, especially in heavily industrialised countries",media
"The UK Health Security Agency estimates that around 36,000 deaths annually are attributable to air pollution in the UK, with this number jumping to 2 million in China",media
"This is in part due to causing new, or exacerbating existing, chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which one in five people suffer with in the UK",media
"It also reduces life expectancy through prolonged exposure, causing diseases such as coronary heart disease and lung cancer",media
"Extreme heat In 2023, increased heat exposure put those engaged in outdoor physical activity (which includes everything from agricultural labour to recreational running) at risk of heat stress for 28% more hours than two decades ago",media
"Heat stress has been associated with debilitating issues such as kidney stones, exhaustion, asthma and heart attacks",media
Any amount of activity or movement in rising temperatures will put individuals at great risk of these conditions,media
"This will compromise income if labour is based outdoors, population health if we can do less outside, and the ability to enjoy the outdoor world",media

"""How to live forever Skip to content Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather Newsletters How to live forever 21 April 2014 Share Save Frank Swain Features correspondent Share Save (Thinkstock) If more and more people are living past 100, how much older can we survive to, in theory, asks Frank Swain",media
And what would it take to achieve this in practice,media
"On the Art of Prolonging Life was penned by a Dr Huseland (“one of the soundest minds in Germany”) in 1797, concluding eight years of study on the topic",media
He identified among the many factors associated with long life: a moderate diet that was rich in vegetables and short on meat and sweetened pastries; an active lifestyle; good care of your teeth; weekly bathing in lukewarm water with soap; good sleep; clean air; and being born to parents who themselves lived long lives,media
"Toward the end of his essay, translated for the American Review, the doctor wistfully speculated that “human life may be prolonged to double the extent of what is supposed to be its present limits, without losing activity and usefulness",media
"” By Huseland’s estimates, half of all children born would die before their tenth birthday, an alarmingly high mortality rate",media
"However, if the child could run the gauntlet of youth fraught with smallpox, measles, rubella, and other childhood diseases, they stood a fair chance of making it all the way to their mid-thirties",media
"In ideal circumstances, Huseland thought it possible that a lifetime could stretch for two hundred years",media
Is there more to these claims than the fanciful imagination of an 18th century doctor,media
James Vaupel doesn’t think it’s out of the question,media
"“Life expectancy is increasing two-and-a-half years every decade,” he says",media
“That’s twenty five years every century,media
"” As director of the Laboratory of Survival and Longevity at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, Vaupel studies longevity and survival in human and animal populations",media
He tells me that the pattern of improvements to mortality has shifted greatly in the past 100 years,media
"Before 1950, most of the gains in life expectancy were made by combating the high infant mortality that Huseland noted",media
"Since then, however, it’s been the over-60s and most recently the over-80s who’ve seen the greatest decreases in mortality",media
"In other words, we are not just surviving childhood in greater numbers, we’re living longer – a lot longer",media
"Age complex Worldwide, the number of centenarians – people over the age of 100 – is predicted to increase 10-fold between 2010 and 2050",media
"As Huseland testified, a strong component in whether you’ll live to see this milestone lies in the age of your parents; that is, there is a genetic component to long life",media
"But the rise in centenarians can’t be explained by genetics alone, which clearly haven’t changed much in the last couple of centuries",media
"Rather, it’s a host of improvements to our lives that cumulatively improve our chances of living longer and stronger, many of which echo the factors identified by Huseland",media
"The reasons include better healthcare, improving medical treatments, public health measures like cleaner water and air, better education, and improved standards of living such as houses that are warm and dry",media
"“Mostly it’s down to having more medicine and money,” says Vaupel",media
"Recent decades have seen significant improvements in life expectancy for the elderly (Thinkstock) Nonetheless, the gains offered by better healthcare and living conditions still leave many people dissatisfied, and the appetite for life-extension therapies shows no sign of abating",media
One popular approach is caloric restriction,media
"In the 1930s, researchers noticed that mice fed on a near-starvation diet lived far longer than those allowed to eat until full",media
"A subsequent study on rhesus monkeys also showed this, but this was contradicted by a 20-year-long study by the US National Institute on Ageing, which found that although rhesus monkeys kept on a calorie-restricted diet developed age-related diseases slightly later than controls, they did not live longer on average",media
"The authors noted that though caloric restriction in long-lived animals conferred some benefits, these were subject to a complex interplay of genetics, nutrition and environmental factors",media
"Another great hope is resveratrol, a chemical produced naturally by plants, notably in the skin of grapes",media
"Whether vineyards can be said to hide the fountain of youth, however, remains doubtful",media
"The chemical has been noted to produce similar health benefits to caloric restriction in animal models, but as yet, no study has shown that taking resveratrol can increase human lifespan",media
No limits But why do we age at all,media
"“Every day we suffer damage and don’t perfectly repair it,” explains Vaupel, “and this accumulation of unrepaired damage is what causes age-related disease",media
” It’s not a trait that is shared by all living organisms,media
"Hydra for example – a group of simple, jellyfish-like creatures – are able to repair almost all the damage they suffer, and readily slough cells that are too injured to heal",media
"In humans, it’s damaged cells like these that can give rise to cancerous tumours",media
"“Hydras allocate resources primarily toward repair, rather than reproduction,” says Vaupel",media
"“Humans, by contrast, primarily direct resources toward reproduction, it’s a different survival strategy at a species level",media
"” Humans may live fast and die young, but our prodigious fertility allows us to overcome these high mortality rates",media
"Now that infant mortality is so low, there’s really no need to channel so many resources into reproduction, says Vaupel",media
“The trick is to up-regulate repair instead of diverting that energy into getting fat,media
"In theory that should be possible, though nobody has any idea about how to do it",media
” If the steady accretion of damage to our cells can be arrested – so-called negligible senescence – then perhaps we won’t have an upper age limit,media
"If that’s the case, there isn’t any reason why we should have to die at all",media
"Hydra can repair almost all its damaged cells, shedding any that are too injured to heal (Science Photo Library) “It would be wonderful to get to a world where all death is optional",media
"Right now, essentially all of us are sentenced to the death penalty, even though most of us have done nothing to deserve it",media
"” So says Gennady Stolyarov, transhumanist philosopher and author of Death Is Wrong, a controversial children’s book that encourages young minds to reject the fatalist notion that death is inevitable",media
Stolyarov is fervently opposed to what he sees is simply a technological challenge waiting for the appropriate level of money and manpower to solve it,media
Agents of change One focus for technological intervention are telomeres,media
"These caps on chromosomes shorten every time your cells divide, putting a hard limit on the number of times your cells can reproduce themselves",media
"Not all animals experience this telomere shortening, the hydra being one of them",media
"However, there are good reasons to have these limitations in place",media
"Occasional mutations can allow cells to divide without shortening their telomeres, giving rise to “immortal” cell lines",media
"However, in an uncontrolled situation, these immortal cells would be very bad news for the person they are in, bloating into cancerous tumours",media
"“One hundred and fifty thousand people in the world die each day , two thirds of those die from causes related to senescence,” Stolyarov tells me",media
"“So even if we can hasten the arrival of these technologies to achieve negligible senescence by one day, we will have saved a hundred thousand lives",media
” The author quotes geronotology theoretician Aubrey de Grey – something of a celebrity in the world of life extension – as stating that there is a 50% chance of achieving negligible senescence in the next 25 years,media
"“There’s a good chance that it will happen in our lifetimes, before we experience the most deleterious effects of senescence,” says Stolyarov",media
"“Achieving negligible human senescence in 25 years is possible,” says Vaupel, “but highly unlikely",media
” He concedes that it might be possible to rapidly accelerate life expectancy through medical breakthroughs,media
"But he warns that equally, there may be difficulties in the future that we don’t anticipate",media
"“Disease, economic crisis, and climate change might cause increases in mortality,” he says",media
"Telomeres, the protective ends of chromosomes, are linked to ageing of cells (Science Photo Library) Stolyarov is hoping to kindle a small spark of hope into an eternal flame",media
"“What I think is necessary right now is a determined push to dramatically accelerate the pace of technological progress,” he says",media
"“We have a fighting chance right now, but in order to make it happen we have to be the agents of change",media
"” For now, readers will have to take comfort in the knowledge that there are well-documented ways to try to avoid the Western world’s two biggest killers – heart disease and cancer – through a combination of exercise, healthy eating, and moderation when it comes to alcohol and red meat",media
"Very few of us actually manage to live by these criteria, perhaps because we think a shorter life filled with rich food and wine is a worthy trade",media
"Which leads to the conundrum – if eternal life was possible, would you be willing to pay the price",media

But this is set to change,media
"Declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy mean that by 2050, the number of people over 60 in Africa is projected to triple to 235 million (about 9% of the African population)",media
"This demographic shift is occurring when global climate change is intensifying, leading to more frequent and severe extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and tropical cyclones",media
"By 2050, older adults in Africa are projected to face significantly higher heat exposure due to rapid population growth and climate change, with an increase in extreme heat events",media
"This will heighten health risks and put pressure on local services, especially in low-income areas with limited ability to cope with the strain",media
"As we age, it gets harder to control body temperature",media
Longtime health issues like heart and lung disease and diabetes make older people more likely to become dehydrated,media
"In Africa, many older people struggle to get the physical, mental, social and financial support they need to cope with the direct and indirect effects of extreme weather",media
Urgent strategies are therefore needed to protect older people from extreme weather such as heatwaves,media
These include cooling infrastructure (air conditioning) and early warning systems that tell older people when it is getting dangerously hot,media
Climate change adaptation plans must be integrated with policies on ageing to protect older people,media
I research climate gerontology – the intersection between ageing and climate change,media
As part of my research I am undertaking a series of Global Ageing and Climate Change Regional Dialogues in collaboration with HelpAge International,media
Here are the key issues we found in Africa,media
Climate change is harsh on older people Older people vary in health and mobility,media
"Some older individuals remain active and healthy, allowing them to cope better with the disruptions caused by extreme weather",media
"Other, less active older adults tend to be vulnerable to climate-related threats because of weaker physical health, reduced mobility and higher risk of existing disease",media
Heat can be deadly for older people,media
"Adam Kaz/Getty Images In Africa, older people are at greater risk because the continent has limited basic infrastructure",media
"This is especially the case in rural areas, where access to healthcare, clean water and emergency services is often poor",media
"Poverty, living alone, and depending on small-scale farming make them even more susceptible to extreme weather",media
"The impact of climate change disproportionately affects the continent, resulting in severe floods , droughts and unprecedented heatwaves",media
"In 2023 alone , about 15,700 people were killed in extreme weather disasters in Africa, and a further 34 million people affected",media
"Storm Daniel caused widespread devastation in Libya , displacing 2",media
4 million people,media
"Kenya , Somalia and Ethiopia experienced intense rainfall and flooding",media
"Northern Africa faced record-breaking heat, with temperatures reaching 49",media
0°C in Tunisia and 50,media
4°C in Algeria,media
"Severe droughts hit Morocco, Algeria and Zambia, affecting millions",media
"Prolonged droughts and crop failures make food shortages worse and mean that older people are unable to access healthy, nutritious food",media
"Floods contribute to displacement and difficulties in accessing healthcare, resulting in stress and anxiety",media
Older people are also affected by the digital divide,media
Not having as much access to digital tools like smartphones means they cannot always get the information they need,media
"They may not be able to see climate change education programmes, or get early warnings of extreme weather",media
Solutions Traditional knowledge: This is the understanding and practices that older people in Africa have gained over generations about their local environment,media
"It includes knowing about climate patterns, resource use and disaster preparedness",media
Recognising this valuable knowledge can help communities adapt to climate change and strengthen local community resilience,media
Regular assessments: Local authorities and community organisations must monitor how older people are coping with climate impacts,media
This will lead to more effective adaptation strategies that make use of their insights,media
"Healthy ageing: Older people need support to take care of their bodies, minds and social lives so that they can stay active and remain independent",media
"Healthy ageing helps prevent illness and disabilities, and allows older adults to connect with communities and cope with extreme weather",media
"One-stop shops for older people: These should be set up by community-based organisations, charities and government agencies to provide services such as financial assistance, healthcare and nutrition support specifically tailored for older people",media
They could also train older people to adapt to climate change,media
"Involve older people in climate adaptation: Through their local organisations, older people should be involved in disaster risk reduction plans",media
Older people have already played vital roles in climate adaptation efforts across Africa,media
"In Kenya, their mobilisation for national tree planting initiatives shows what a great contribution older people can make to the environment",media
A group of different generations also works together in Kenya on Agriculture for the Aged – planting climate-resilient crops to cope with unpredictable weather patterns,media
"Policy changes needed For these solutions to become a reality, policies, and budgets are needed",media
"First, policymakers should consult older people and their representatives when they draw up climate resilience strategies",media
Region-specific strategies are best,media
"For example, when setting up community-based early warning systems for extreme weather events, local authorities could work with non-governmental organisations to create a system that provides timely alerts aimed at older people",media
"Second, age-friendly infrastructure , such as accessible healthcare facilities and housing that can withstand extreme weather, must be set up",media
"Read more: Why older people are some of those worst affected by climate change Third, stronger laws and political commitment will result in stronger policies for older people",media
The lack of political will often results in insufficient attention and resources being allocated to the needs of older people in climate action,media
"Without strong commitment from policymakers, older populations are frequently overlooked",media
This limits their ability to adapt effectively,media
"Fourth, social protection systems such as cash transfer programmes must be improved to give financial help to vulnerable older people",media
Programmes that provide direct support and jobs in projects that protect against climate impacts are also a good idea,media
"To make this happen, governments and institutions must start collecting more data on how older people are affected by climate change",media
"By developing inclusive policies, we can promote healthy ageing while empowering older adults to play an active role in building climate resilience",media

These consequences are now starting to come to fore,media
Several examples have recently played out,media
"For example, in Russia, an anthrax outbreak in the remote region of Siberia meant that nomadic communities and thousands of reindeer were affected",media
The outbreak was due to the bodies of infected people buried in 1941 defrosting and releasing anthrax spores into the water system as the permafrost defrosts with global warming,media
"Closer to home, prisoners are starving in Malawian jails and suffering from acute severe malnutrition as a result of food shortages due to erratic climate conditions from both droughts and floods",media
Malawi has since declared a state of national disaster,media
"These unanticipated public health consequences of unsustainable development reminds the world that the issues are not in the distant future, but instead face us now",media
Climate change exerts its influence on public health through three main mechanisms,media
"First, the effects of extreme weather events such as heat, storms, floods or fire that directly cause loss of life or illness",media
"Second, there are indirect effects of climate change on natural systems",media
"This leads to, for example, changes in disease vectors such as mosquitoes that spread malaria, availability of fresh water, crop survival, or the concentration of pollen in the air",media
"Third, the effects on economic and social systems as people migrate or conflict over scarce resources",media
These effects can be moderated by the presence of early warning systems and effective disaster and emergency medical services,media
More affluent communities with more resources will be better able to adapt and withstand these effects,media
Having strong primary healthcare systems will also increase the resilience of communities,media
"But in sub-Saharan Africa many communities do not have these protective mechanisms in place, and will be particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change",media

"These environmental risks include: air, water and soil pollution; ultraviolet radiation; the built environment; the occupational environment; agricultural methods; and climate and ecosystem changes",media
"Children, the elderly, and those living in low- and middle-income countries are most at risk",media
"The diseases that make the greatest environmentally attributable contribution to the global burden of disease are stroke, ischaemic heart disease, diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infection, cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease",media
And over the last ten years the contribution of non-communicable diseases has significantly increased,media
"An example in South Africa is from Mpumalanga’s Highveld, which has 12 coal fired power stations",media
The collective air pollution from these power stations has been reported as being responsible for just over half of the deaths from respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease in the area,media
Living differently Sustainable development has been defined as: … development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs,media
The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals recognise that improving the wellbeing and health of people requires an approach that protects the planet from degradation,media
This is required because there are ecological limits to development that is based on ever-increasing consumption,media
But the climate crisis is just one of the manifestations of the world’s collective inability to live sustainably,media
There is also a loss of ecosystems and the biodiversity,media
"This compromises the natural services they render to humanity: food, fresh water, clean air, building materials and even new medicines",media
Economic inequality is increasing,media
It is reported that 62 people now own as much wealth as 50% of the planet’s population,media
"At the same time, we have seen unprecedented population growth and increasing urbanisation that is characterised by the growth of slums or informal settlements",media
The 21st-century challenge Humanity’s biggest challenge in the 21st century may be its ability to find a way of living sustainably and to tackle the crises of both planetary and public health,media
This will require action on a global scale by world leaders and by a change in collective consciousness,media
There are some encouraging signs,media
Brazil has joined China and the US in ratifying the Paris agreement on tackling climate change,media
China and the US are responsible for 38% of global emissions,media
World religious leaders have also joined forces to promote a change of consciousness as part of a “ season of creation ”,media
"It can be summed up in the video message from Pope Francis, who says the relationship between poverty and the fragility of the planet requires another way of managing the economy and measuring progress, conceiving a new way of life",media

com/ghanas-health-system-isnt-quite-ready-for-climate-change-realities-122912 Link copied Share article Climate change has been labelled as the greatest public health risk of the 21st century,media
Health risks from climate change are expected to become increasingly severe in the coming years,media
They threaten the many advances being made in global public health,media
Several health risks are anticipated from climate change,media
These include increases of vector-borne and diarrhoeal diseases,media
There are also changes in the geographic range of infectious diseases,media
"This means a spread into new regions, the emergence of new infectious diseases and reemergence of old ones",media
An increase in the intensity of infectious diseases in already endemic regions is also expected,media
"Although climate change is a global threat, the potential risks are relatively higher in developing economies",media
"These countries have overburdened and weak health systems, coupled with persistently poor health infrastructure",media
It’s anticipated that some of the worst effects of climate change will be felt in sub-Saharan Africa,media
"For example, climatic change has been reported as a driving force for the malaria highland invasion in the East African highlands",media
It is crucial that countries’ public health systems are able to cope with climate sensitive diseases,media
The World Health Organisation (WHO) has acknowledged this and has outlined a range of mitigating measures,media
"It identifies rebuilding public health capacity among the most important, cost-effective and urgent responses to climate change",media
This includes training in climate change and health to strengthen the technical and professional capacity of health personnel,media
"Effective surveillance and emergency response systems also need to be put in place, coupled with sustainable prevention and control programmes",media
"In addition, countries need to design national health adaptation strategies, implement programmes to mitigate the health eﬀects of climate change, and strengthen institutional capacities to address the health effects of climate change",media
I set out to study whether Ghana’s health system and health workers are prepared for the potential health risks linked to climate change,media
These risks include possible outbreaks of communicable diseases like meningococcal meningitis and cholera,media
The research The research focused on two districts located in different ecological zones,media
"The areas, located in the southern and northern zones, were chosen to account for different perspectives",media
The focus of the research was on the capacity and preparedness towards climate related health emergencies as it relates to climate sensitive infectious diseases,media
Capacity and preparedness were assessed in two ways,media
"First, I looked at whether programmes had been strengthened for professional health personnel to equip them to address potential climate related health risks",media
This could include human resource skill building and education,media
"I also assessed the ability of health services to respond to potential emergencies from climate sensitive infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and management",media
In-depth interviews and surveys were carried out among health professionals within public health facilities located in the two districts,media
Potential climate change health emergency risks that relate to climate sensitive infectious diseases within the Ghanaian context were assessed in both districts,media
The questions related only to known health risks and diseases,media
The study showed that there were no capacity strengthening programmes for health workers to equip them to address potential climate related health risks,media
Over 80% of respondents from both study districts reported not receiving training or workshops targeted towards climate change and health,media
"As a result, 65% of respondents in each district reported not having enough information to respond to climate related public health threats",media
Respondents gave contrasting views on the issue of emergency preparedness and management,media
Some said they were prepared to address potential climate health risks and emergencies,media
Others said they weren’t,media
Respondents who indicated unpreparedness bemoaned the challenges they faced in delivering even basic health services,media
They concluded that they were not ready to deal with the impact of climate change on local populations’ health,media
"On the other hand, some respondents specified having the needed support, the necessary human resources and strategies in place to help address the health threats from climate change",media
The study also showed that the position of a health facility on the hierarchical structure affected its capacity and preparedness levels,media
Health workers interviewed within the higher level of health delivery (district hospitals) acknowledged some level of preparedness to deal with climate health emergencies compared to those at the lower level (health centres),media
Both levels nevertheless declared they might have challenges in addressing climate change health emergencies,media
"Overall, the study ﬁndings indicate that health systems capacity and preparedness levels towards climate change health risks didn’t diﬀer across the study contexts",media
Way forward Our study also shed light on the urgent need for reforms to combat the looming health impact of climate change,media
The findings call for vital measures to be put in place in terms of health systems adaptation planning and resilience building,media
"It became apparent that knowledge, skill building, provision of logistics and infrastructure urgently need attention",media
"There is also a need to provide more resources, especially at the local levels",media
"In addition, health professionals require in-service training programmes on climate change and health needs",media
Training and education are key to improving preparedness and capacity,media

"com/climate-change-is-making-it-harder-for-people-to-get-the-care-they-need-240557 Link copied Share article The world is witnessing the consequences of climate change: long-lasting changes in temperature and rainfall, and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding and drought",media
All make it harder for families and communities to meet their care needs,media
Climate change affects care systems in various ways,media
"First, sudden illnesses and unexpected disabilities heighten the need for care",media
"Second, it reduces access to important inputs for care such as water, food and safe shelter",media
"Third, it can damage physical and social care infrastructures",media
It can also lead to breakdowns of traditional units of caregiving such as households and communities,media
And it creates new situations of need with the increase in displaced person settlements and refugee camps,media
"Climate change creates sudden spikes in the demand for care, and serious challenges to meeting the growing need for care",media
All this has immediate and long lasting effects on human well-being,media
The size of the current unmet care needs throughout the world is substantial,media
"In childcare alone, about 23% of children worldwide – nearly 350 million – need childcare but do not have it",media
Families in low- and lower-middle-income countries are the most in need,media
"Similarly, as the world’s population ages rapidly, only a small proportion of the elderly who need assistance are able to use formal care (in an institution or paid homecare)",media
Most are cared for by family members or other unpaid caregivers,media
Much of this unpaid care and formal care work is provided by women and girls,media
Hundreds of millions of people around the world struggle to get healthcare,media
Expansion of access to essential health services has slowed compared to pre-2015,media
And healthcare costs still create financial hardship,media
"Without comprehensive public and global support for care provision and the integration of care in the climate agenda, unmet care needs will only grow and inequalities will widen",media
Impact Climate change interacts with human health in complex ways,media
Its impact is highly uneven across populations,media
"It depends on geographical region, income, education, gender roles, social norms, level of development, and the institutional capacity and accessibility of health systems",media
"In 2018-22, Africa experienced the biggest increase in the heat-related mortality rate since 2000-05",media
This is not surprising as the continent has more frequent health-threatening temperatures than ever before and a growing population of people older than 65,media
"Africa is also the region most affected by droughts in 2013-22, with 64% of its land area affected by at least one month of extreme drought per year on average",media
It was followed by Oceania (55% of its land area) and South and Central America (53%),media
Scientific evidence also points to increases in health inequalities caused by climate change,media
The health effects of climate change are not uniformly felt by different population groups,media
"Exposure, severity of impact, and ability of individuals to recover depend on a variety of factors",media
"Physiological characteristics, income, education, type of occupation, location, social norms and health systems are some of them",media
"For example, older people and young children face the greatest health risks from high temperatures",media
There is also evidence of the disproportionate effect of climate change on the health of people living in poverty and those who belong to disadvantaged groups,media
Women of lower social and economic status and with less education are more vulnerable to heat stress compared to women in wealthier households and with higher education or social status,media
"They are exposed to pollution in the absence of clean cooking fuel, and to extreme heat as they walk to gather water and fuel, or do other work outdoors",media
Bad sanitation in poor urban areas increases the incidence of water-borne diseases after heavy rains and floods,media
"Lack of access to healthcare services and the means to pay for medicines make it difficult for women and men in low-income households to recover from illness, heat strokes, and air pollution-related ailments",media
Mental health problems are being attributed to climate change as well,media
"Studies show that the loss of family or kin member, home, livelihood and a safe environment can bring about direct emotional impacts",media
These adverse impacts increase the demand for caregiving and the care workload,media
"Climate-induced health problems force family and community caregivers, particularly women, to spend more time looking after the sick and disabled, particularly frail elderly people and children",media
"Effect on food and water Climate change threatens the availability of food, clean water and safe shelter",media
It erodes households’ and communities’ care capacity and hence societies’ ability to thrive,media
"Fluctuations in food supply and rising food prices as a result of environmental disasters, along with the inadequacy of government policies, underscore the mounting challenge of meeting food needs",media
The threat of chronic shortage of safe drinking water has also risen,media
Water scarcity is an area where structural inequalities and gender disparities are laid bare,media
"Care for the sick and disabled, the young and the elderly is compromised when water is scarce",media
Effects on providing care Extreme weather events disrupt physical care infrastructures,media
"It may be hard to reach hospitals, clinics, daycare centres, nursery schools and nursing homes",media
Some facilities may be damaged and have to close,media
Another type of care system that can break down is family networks and support provided by friends and neighbours,media
These informal care sharing arrangements are illustrated in a study of the three large informal settlements in Nairobi,media
About half (50,media
5%) of the sampled households reported having had a sick member in the two weeks before the survey,media
The majority relied on close friends and family members living nearby for care and support,media
"Studies have shown that climate change eventually leads to livelihood loss and resource scarcity, which can weaken social cohesion and local safety nets in affected communities",media
Heightened risks and uncertainty and imminent changes in socio-economic and political conditions can also compel individuals or entire households to migrate,media
"Migration is caused by a host of factors, but it has increasingly been a climate-related response",media
"The World Bank’s Groundswell Report released in 2018 , for example, projected that climate change could force 216 million people to move within their countries by 2050 to avoid the slow-onset impacts of climate change",media
"A possible consequence of migration is the withdrawal of care support provided by the migrating extended kin, neighbours or friends, increasing the caregiving load of people left behind",media
"In the case of forced displacements, the traditional social networks existing in communities are disrupted entirely",media
What’s needed There are compelling reasons to believe that meeting care needs can also help mitigate the effects of climate change,media
"And actions to meet carbon-zero goals, prevent biodiversity loss and regenerate ecosystems can reduce the care work burden that falls heavily on families, communities and women",media
"Any effort to tackle these grave problems should be comprehensive in scope and must be based on principles of equality, universality, and responsibility shared by all",media

"While everyone will be affected, these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities, depending on underlying economic, geographic, social and health status",media
"Recently there’s been increasing attention on climate change and health, including calls from Australian scientists , led by Professor Peter Doherty, for the government to put climate change on the G20 agenda",media
"My research focuses on social inequality, and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities, including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices",media
I presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent Australian Academy of Science symposium on climate and health,media
Inequities of man-made natural disasters Low-lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones,media
"These storms can generate storm surges causing flooding, direct injury and damage to infrastructure, including housing, water and sanitation systems",media
"Poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures, less safe locations and building sites, and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage",media
"At the end of 2013, the Philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon Haiyan, which affected 16 million people",media
"6,069 people were reported dead while 4",media
"1 million people were displaced, with 1",media
1 million houses damaged or destroyed,media
"While everyone was touched by the typhoon, large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing, they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low-lying regions",media
"Poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate-related disasters, or to rebuild",media
The ﬂooding of New Orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities,media
Elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport,media
We see similar issues with heatwaves,media
Lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat,media
This increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths,media
"Poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure, buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods",media
Impacts on agriculture Our agricultural systems are also under threat,media
"Increasing drought periods in Australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions, and hence those communities that depend on primary production",media
"This will affect people’s income, stress levels and sense of hope",media
"In 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern Victoria, destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle",media
"But the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community, typical of other rural Australian communities",media
"Economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship, led to closures in local businesses, and young people moving away",media
This has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities,media
These factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts,media
Climate change also exacerbates food insecurity,media
Modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33% increase in the price of vegetables and a 43% increase in fruit prices in Australia because of the drought and extreme weather events,media
"Rising food prices most affect the poor — as a proportion of total household expenditure, food makes up an average of around 19%",media
"But, with 12% of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face",media
"Climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce, fish, lean meat and so on, and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories",media
"Cheap calories are found in the most highly processed, long shelf-life products, containing hardened fats and bulk starches, preserved with sugar or salt",media
Where does inequality come from,media
"Climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards, resource use, levels of exposure to environmental stresses, and existing health inequities",media
"Australians who are more socially disadvantaged (by income, employment status, education) and Indigenous Australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease and cancers",media
"Parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment, low levels of education, and poor and dangerous housing conditions, leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes",media
The health experience of people living in rural and remote Australia is often worse than the urban average,media
Climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people,media
"In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems",media
The best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality,media
This might include : fairer and more sustainable food systems; affordable quality housing; pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages; and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas,media
"This will not only improve health, but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment",media

Gains from net zero are often presented as global benefits and mainly for future generations,media
But less fossil fuel use also means less air pollution which results in local health gains right away,media
"For example, rapid health gains are predicted from policies for US net zero by 2050",media
"By 2035, between 4,000 to 15,000 fewer US residents would die annually from air pollution, saving the US economy $65bn to $128bn , with even greater benefits thereafter",media
"A study , led by Imperial College London, has found that there are large health gains from UK net zero actions",media
"Dr Mike Holland, who was part of the study team, said: “Fundamental changes required for net zero will bring long lasting benefits to UK health",media
Or turn that around,media
"If we don’t take the net zero path, we will be sicker",media
This would be a double own goal on both climate and health,media
” The researchers looked at the net zero pathways for transport and buildings in the UK’s sixth carbon budget,media
"Health improvements came about from less air pollution and also increased exercise from more walking, cycling and e-biking",media
By 2060 the economic gains from fewer deaths would amount to £26bn-£31bn,media
New evidence meant they were also able to estimate gains from less illness too; around £20bn adding to the economic benefits from net zero,media
"Some gains would be expected straight away, as air pollution decreased",media
"These include fewer new cases of asthma in children and adults, as well as reduced hospital admissions for breathing and heart problems",media
This is consistent with recent health improvements that followed Bradford’s clean air zone and others around Europe,media
Fewer strokes and heart attacks would emerge more slowly over five years as air pollution started to reduce,media
"For lung cancer, the reduction in cases would be expected to lag air pollution improvements by six to 20 years",media
But the gains would not stop in 2060,media
Children born in the 2050s would suffer from fewer air pollution illnesses as they grew up and aged as adults,media
"Although less certain than the other illnesses studied, the greatest long-term gains could be in cases of dementia",media
"skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Walking, cycling and e-biking as part of net zero, would also lead to health gains",media
"Prof Christian Brand, part of the study team, said: “If transport decarbonisation focuses mainly on commuting, how much health improvement and emissions reduction are we leaving on the table",media
"Without policies that support all forms of mobility – especially the short, everyday trips that reduce car dependency – are we missing a crucial opportunity to maximize the full benefits of net zero",media
"” Participation is key to maximising these gains across society, especially amongwomen and older people",media
"The study found that people walking or cycling for transport could expect to an average of five and half months longer life expectancy, and a healthier life",media

"I was wrong This article is more than 1 year old In an extract from her book Not the End of the World, data scientist Hannah Ritchie explains how her work taught her that there are more reasons for hope than despair about climate change – and why a truly sustainable world is in reach Hannah Ritchie Q&A: ‘Doomsday predictions are a dream for climate deniers’ “Scientists say temperatures could rise by 6C by 2100 and call for action ahead of UN meeting in Paris” – Independent , 2015",media
A world that was 6C warmer than it is today would be devastating,media
"And remember, 6C is just the average",media
"Some parts of the world would get much warmer, especially the poles",media
Crops would fail,media
Many people would be malnourished,media
Forests would be stripped back into savannahs,media
Island nations would be completely submerged,media
Many cities will have disappeared due to sea-level rise,media
Climate refugees will be on the move,media
“Normal” temperatures in many parts of the world would be unbearable,media
"Even the richest, most temperate nations would see devastating floods most winters and baking summers",media
"We would be at very high risk of setting off warming feedback loops – the melted ice would reflect less sunlight, the melted permafrost might unlock methane from the bottom of the ocean, and dying forests wouldn’t be able to regrow to suck carbon out of the atmosphere",media
"A 6C warmer world might be short-lived – it could quickly spiral into 8C, 10C or more",media
It would be a massive humanitarian disaster,media
"Only a few years ago, I thought this was where we were headed",media
"5C or 2C – we were destined for 4C, 5C or 6C and there was nothing we could do about it",media
Most people still think that this is the path we’re following,media
"Thankfully, it’s not",media
"In 2015, I went to Paris for the big, famous climate conference, Cop21",media
Representatives and policymakers from every country came together to hash out a new climate deal,media
The previous goal of the international agreement was to keep the global average temperature rise below 2C by the end of the century,media
So I couldn’t believe it when there were rumours that a target of 1,media
5C was being discussed,media
Were they crazy,media
"At that point, I had already given up on the prospects of 2C",media
It was so far out of our reach,media
The notion that we could keep the rise below 1,media
5C seemed delusional,media
And yet the target made it into the final agreement,media
"Mostly as an aspiration, but it was in there nonetheless",media
"The world pledged to “limit global warming to ‘well below’ 2C above pre-industrial levels and also, if possible, ‘pursue’ efforts to cap warming at 1",media
My perspective on 1,media
5C hasn’t shifted much since then,media
"Without a major, unexpected technological breakthrough, we will go past this target",media
Nearly all the climate scientists I know agree: they obviously want to cap warming at 1,media
"5C, but very few think it will happen",media
"This doesn’t stop them fighting for it, though; they know that every 0",media
"1C matters, and is worth working for",media
But my perspective on 2C has changed,media
I’m now cautiously optimistic that we can get close to it,media
"It’s more likely than not that we will pass 2C, but perhaps not by much",media
And there is still a reasonable chance – if we really step up to the challenge – that we can stay below it,media
"My perspective flipped quickly after studying the data, not newspaper headlines",media
"I didn’t focus on where we are today, but on the pace that things have moved at in the past few years, and what this means for the future",media
"One organisation – the Climate Action Tracker – follows every country’s climate policies, and its pledges and targets",media
It combines them all to map out what will happen to the global climate,media
"At Our World in Data, I sketch out these future climate trajectories and update them every year",media
"Every time, they get closer and closer to the pathways we would need to follow to stay below 2C",media
"If we stick with the climate policies that countries currently have in place, we’re heading towards a world of 2",media
5C to 2,media
Let me be clear: this is terrible and we have to avoid it,media
But countries have pledged to go much further,media
They’ve committed to making their policies much more ambitious,media
"If each country was to follow through on their climate pledges, we’d come out at 2",media
1C by 2100,media
What’s most promising is how these pathways have shifted over time,media
"In a world without climate policies, we’d be heading towards 4C or 5C, at least",media
This is the path that most people still think we’re on,media
That would be a scary world indeed,media
"Thankfully, over time, countries have stepped up their commitments",media
"As we saw with the example of the ozone layer, incremental increases in ambition can make a huge difference",media

It now makes financial sense to take the climate-friendly path,media
Leaders have become more optimistic about how the landscape is changing,media
We are still some distance from a 2C pathway,media

I had to know what the latest disaster was,media
To switch off from them seemed like a betrayal to the lives that were lost,media
"With reports of disasters coming at me faster every day, it seemed that things must be getting worse",media
"Climate change was driving an intensification of disasters, and more people were dying than ever before",media
Or so I thought,media
The problem was that I mistook the increase in the frequency of reporting as an increase in the frequency of disasters,media
I mistook an increase in the intensity of my secondhand suffering for an increase in the intensity of global suffering,media
"In reality, I had no idea what was happening",media
Were disasters getting worse,media
Were there more this year than last,media
Were there more people dying than ever before,media
"Then I discovered the work of Swedish physician, statistician and public speaker Hans Rosling",media
Videos of his lectures taught me that extreme poverty and child mortality were falling and education and life expectancy were rising,media
I went looking for other areas where my preconceptions might be wrong,media
I started with data on “natural” disasters,media
I would have bet a lot of money that more people were dying from disasters today than a century ago,media
I was completely wrong,media
Death rates from disasters have actually fallen since the first half of the 20th century,media
And not just by a little bit,media
They have fallen roughly tenfold,media
It’s at this point that I should make one thing clear: none of the above means that climate change is not happening,media
The decline in deaths from disasters does not mean that disasters are getting weaker or less common,media
Deniers often misuse this data to downplay the existence or risks of climate change,media
But that’s not what the data shows us at all,media
"In the past, it was common for disasters to claim millions of lives a year",media
"The 1920s, 30s and 40s were particularly bad",media
"There were a few large earthquakes that claimed many lives: China, Japan, Pakistan, Turkey and Italy were all hit by a series of earthquakes that cost tens of thousands of lives",media
"The most lethal – the 1920 earthquake that struck the Gansu province in China – is estimated to have killed 180,000 people",media
But it was drought and floods that were the most deadly,media
"China endured a number of large floods and droughts through the 1920s and 30s, which often led to widespread famine and killed millions at a time",media
"Today, the annual death toll is much smaller, usually between 10,000 and 20,000",media
"Sometimes, there are particularly devastating years where the toll is much higher – like 2010, when the annual death toll was more than 300,000, with most deaths resulting from the Haitian earthquake",media
"When I zoomed out and saw these trends, I felt stupid",media
I also felt cheated,media
I had been duped by an education system that was supposed to teach me about the world,media
I was a diligent student,media
"I won medals for coming top for everything, from earth materials to sedimentology, atmospheric science to oceanography",media
"I could create complex diagrams of seismic faults, I could recite the chemical formulas of pages of minerals from memory, but if you’d asked me to draw a graph of what was happening to deaths from disasters, I’d have sketched it upside down",media
I wasn’t alone in my ignorance,media
"In the 2017 Gapminder Misconception Study, the public, across 14 countries, were asked 12 key questions, one of which was: How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the past 100 years",media
a) More than doubled b) Remained more or less the same c) Decreased to less than half Just 10% got the right answer: c),media
"The most popular answer, 48% of the vote, was a)",media
"T o tackle climate change, we have to accept two things: climate change is happening and human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible",media
We simply don’t have time to argue about the existence of climate change,media
"By “we”, I mean all of us, collectively",media
The time for debating is over,media
We need to move past it to the question of what we’re going to do about it,media
Let’s take a close look at where we are with carbon emissions,media
"They are still rising, but the world has already passed the peak of per capita emissions",media
It happened a decade ago,media
Most people are unaware of this,media
"In 2012, the world topped out at 4",media
9 tonnes per person,media
"Since then, per capita emissions have been slowly falling",media
"Nowhere near fast enough, but falling nonetheless",media
This is a signal that the peak in our total (not per capita) CO 2 emissions is coming,media
This is the case with any metric in a world with an increasing population,media
"Per capita measures will peak first, then it’s a tug-of-war over whether our impacts per person will fall more quickly than the population is growing",media
We are very close,media
"Emissions increased rapidly in the 1960s and 70s, then again in the 1990s and early 2000s",media
"But in recent years, this growth has slowed down a lot",media
Emissions barely increased at all from 2018 to 2019,media
And they actually fell in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic,media
I’m optimistic we can peak global emissions in the 2020s,media
One of the simple things that brings me the most joy in life is getting an email from my grandma,media
My gran is in her mid-80s and can almost work an iPad,media
"By “work”, I mean do the basics of looking at a photograph and sending an email",media
"She doesn’t have an iPhone, a laptop or a smartwatch",media
"My grandpa rejects all modern technology, except television",media
Their life is very similar to how it was a few decades ago,media
This has created something of a divide between the generations on climate change,media
Many see the lifestyles of youngsters as the problem,media
We spend all day on energy-guzzling gadgets,media
We flock to dense cities with no gardens or green space,media
We buy lots of stuff and don’t bother to repair it,media
We never ration food and waste too much of it,media
"View image in fullscreen Climate activists protest against fossil fuels at Cop28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 12 December 2023",media
Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ Yet my carbon footprint is less than half that of my grandparents’ when they were my age,media
"When my grandparents were in their 20s, the average person in the UK emitted 11 tonnes of CO 2 per year",media
We now emit less than five tonnes,media
The gap between me and my parents is equally wide,media
"From the 1950s to the 90s, emissions in the UK changed very little",media
It’s only since then – in my lifetime – that emissions have plummeted,media
Technology has made that possible,media
"In 1900, nearly all of the UK’s energy came from coal and, by 1950, it was still supplying more than 90%",media
"Now coal supplies less than 2% of our electricity, and the government has pledged to phase it out completely by 2025",media
"Coal is now almost dead in its birthplace, where it all began",media
"It has been replaced with other sources of energy: gas, then nuclear, and now a transition to wind, solar and other renewable sources",media
"That means that, for every unit of energy we consume, we emit much less CO 2",media
But that’s not the only change,media
We also use much less energy overall,media
Per capita energy use has fallen by around 25% since the 1960s,media
"Year after year, more efficient gadgets have come into our lives",media
"First, it was improvements in the energy ratings of white goods, then it was the trend of replacing inefficient lightbulbs",media
Then it was double-glazed windows and home insulation to stop heat leaking out into the street,media
"When I was a kid, our family television – we “only” had one – was a massive box that seemed to be two metres deep",media
The screen was so small you had to sit really close to see anything,media
Our car was a gas guzzler,media
Not a gas guzzler like we see with SUVs today,media
My parents would never have bought one of those,media
"No, our car was secondhand and it was a “banger”",media
It was inefficient: you could hear the engine roar and feel it overheating,media
The miles per gallon were terrible,media
"These massive strides in technology mean that we use much less energy than we did in the past, despite appearing to lead much more extravagant, energy-intensive lifestyles",media
The notion that we need to be frugal to live a low-carbon life is simply wrong,media
"In the UK, we now emit about the same as someone in the 1850s",media
I emit the same as my great-great-great-grandparents,media
"And I have a much, much higher standard of living",media
Yet very few people know that emissions are falling,media
The climate scientist Jonathan Foley recently polled his followers on Twitter,media
He asked what had happened to emissions in the US over the past 15 years,media
Had they: a) Increased by more than 20% b) Increased by 10% c) Stayed the same d) Fallen by 20% Thousands of people answered,media
Two-thirds of people picked a) or b),media
Just 19% picked the correct answer d),media
No wonder people think we’re screwed,media
We have a habit of underestimating how quickly things can change,media
"Most of us have been too pessimistic about renewable energy in the past, even the experts",media
Part of the reason I thought that 2C was so far out of reach was that I couldn’t see how low-carbon energy could grow quickly enough,media
"In just a decade between 2009 and 2019, solar photovoltaic and wind energy went from the most to the least expensive source",media
"The price of electricity from solar has declined by 89%, and the price of onshore wind has declined by 70%",media
They are now cheaper than coal,media
Leaders no longer have to make the difficult choice between climate action and providing energy for their people,media
The low-carbon choice has suddenly become the economic one,media
It’s staggering how quickly this change has happened,media
Poorer countries do not have to follow the fossil fuel-heavy and unsustainable trajectories that rich countries did,media
They can leapfrog the centuries-long journey that we’ve taken,media
And they don’t have to sacrifice human wellbeing or access to energy,media
"In fact, by adopting these technologies they can ensure that even more people have access to affordable energy",media
The huge progress being made in developing affordable low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels is just one counter to the doomsday thinking of so much of the climate change conversation,media
It has become too common to tell kids that they’re going to die from climate change,media
"If a heatwave doesn’t get them, then a wildfire will",media
"Or a hurricane, a flood or mass starvation",media
There is an intense feeling of anxiety and dread among young people about what the planet has in store for us,media
"In my book, I look at realistic ways we can adapt the fields of energy, transport, food and construction to rein in climate change while improving human wellbeing at the same time",media
"If we take several steps back, we can see something truly radical, gamechanging and life-giving: humanity is in a truly unique position to build a sustainable world",media
Another reason some climate scientists are less pessimistic is that they believe that things can change,media
The past few decades have been an uphill battle for them,media
They’ve been mostly ignored,media
Often they were the ones framed as apocalyptic scaremongers,media
"But, finally, the world has woken up to the reality of climate change and people are taking action",media
The climate scientists know change is possible because they’ve seen it happen,media
"Against the odds, they’ve driven much of it",media

"5 years shorter than their southern counterparts, according to a study released on Monday which claims to show in unprecedented detail the link between air pollution and life expectancy",media
High levels of air pollution in northern China – much of it caused by an over-reliance on burning coal for heat – will cause 500 million people to lose an aggregate 2,media
"5 billion years from their lives, the authors predict in the study, published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences",media
"The geographic disparity can be traced back to China's Huai River policy which, since it was implemented between 1950 and 1980, has granted free wintertime heating to people living north of the Huai river, a widely-acknowledged dividing line between northern and southern China",media
"Much of that heating comes from the combustion of coal, significantly impacting the region's air quality",media
"""Using data covering an unusually long timespan – from 1981 through 2000 – the researchers found that air pollution … was about 55% higher north of the river than south of it,"" the MIT Energy Initiative said in a statement",media
"""Linking the Chinese pollution data to mortality statistics from 1991 to 2000, the researchers found a sharp difference in mortality rates on either side of the border formed by the Huai River",media

"On 12 January, Beijing's AQI hit a record 755 , 30 times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organisation",media
Past studies have established a link between air pollution and reduced life expectancy,media
One recent large-scale study concluded that air pollution contributed to 1,media
2 million premature deaths in China in 2010,media
"Yet according to Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at MIT and one of the study's authors, this study is the first to precisely quantify their relationship",media

"2 coronavirus variant end of list It sounds dramatic, and it is, but it also reflects a truth that is staring us in the face: we depend on a healthy planet for food, water, shelter and the air we breathe",media
"But as we plunder its resources and emit pollutants into the atmosphere, we are not only killing the wildlife and plants, we share the earth with, we are directly harming our own health",media
"Attempts to secure more energy, food and infrastructure leave a trail of environmental contamination and human health hazards",media
"It is no secret that humans are inherently selfish creatures; the warning signs of climate change have been present for decades, but it is only since seeing the direct effects it has had on our safety and wellbeing that most of us have been spurred into action",media
Advertisement One of the main items on the COP26 agenda is aiming for a global reduction in fossil fuel burning,media
Fossil fuels are formed from the fossilised remains of dead plants and animals that humans extract and burn for their carbon-containing energy content,media
"They include coal, crude oil and natural gas",media
Burning fossil fuels has been shown to have direct adverse effects on our health,media
Air pollution continues to be a serious public health concern affecting nine out of 10 individuals living in urban areas worldwide,media
Exposure to air pollution is the ninth biggest risk factor for lung and heart damage,media
Burning coal is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions as well as an array of toxic chemicals,media
"China, India and the United States are the world’s main coal mining regions",media
"However, Indonesia, Australia, Russia, South Africa and Colombia also produce large amounts",media
"Coal-burning not only releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the worst greenhouse gases, but also sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury – all of which are harmful to human health",media
"Crude oil combustion also releases harmful gases such as carbon dioxide and sulphur into the atmosphere, whereas burning natural gas can release the powerful greenhouse gas methane when it is heated and compressed to release energy into the air",media
The lungs are the primary organ affected by gases and chemicals released by fossil fuel burning,media
People who work in coal mines are far more likely to suffer from lung diseases like emphysema and bronchitis; both conditions obstruct airways and make it difficult to breathe,media
Those who live near coal stations and breathe in air that contains the harmful components that coal-burning releases are also at higher risk of suffering from these conditions,media
It is time for change; we must demand better from our leaders and no longer sleepwalk alongside them into climate catastrophe,media
"Nitrogen oxide , in particular, can affect the protein component in the lungs and reduce their ability to inflate and deflate as well as they should, meaning airflow is reduced, leaving people with chronic lung conditions that can leave them short of breath",media
"Inhalation of these same chemicals has also been shown to have an adverse effect on the heart muscle in some people, causing it to become bigger and weaker, a condition known as cardiac muscle hypertrophy",media
"Advertisement It stands to reason that if these harmful chemicals can affect adults in such ways, children must also be at increased risk",media
Studies have shown that children exposed to higher levels of carbon in the air have an increased risk of cognitive impairment and even memory issues,media
There is also evidence showing that an association between high levels of nitrogen oxide and pollution from traffic on roads can affect fertility as well as the menstrual cycle in some women and increase the risk of miscarriage during pregnancy,media
"And it is not just women being affected; there has been a steady decline in overall sperm count in men over the last 50 years, with poor air quality thought to play a factor",media
"Air pollution has also been linked to lower birthweights in newborn babies as well as an increased risk of premature delivery, which in itself carries a high risk of health complications for babies",media
"Health authorities and governments have been aware of the evidence linking adverse health outcomes to poor air quality, but many have been slow to act, putting profit and the drive for a growing economy over the health of their populations",media
It is time for change; we must demand better from our leaders and no longer sleepwalk alongside them into climate catastrophe,media
"We are constantly being told that the current infrastructures are too complex to change, that it would cost too much",media

Progress report: What is the AY,media
2 coronavirus subvariant,media
Many of us are now used to hearing about new variants of the coronavirus,media
"The Delta variant has become dominant due to mutations on its spike protein that allow it to more quickly and effectively bind to human host cells, making it more infectious than previous variants",media
Now a new subvariant of the Delta variant has been identified,media
Known as AY,media
"2, it was first identified in the United Kingdom in July and has now spread to at least 42 countries, including the United States, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) weekly epidemiological update on COVID-19",media
"2 subvariant is known to contain two additional mutations on its spike protein, which is the part of the virus that sticks out and allows it to bind to human host cells thereby infecting them",media
The mutations – Y145H and A222V – are currently under investigation by scientists,media
"The questions they will be asking are whether the mutations make this new subvariant more transmissible, more dangerous and more evasive to the immune response triggered by the vaccines",media
"subvariant has only been increasing at a modest rate in the UK, making up approximately 6 percent of new COVID cases during the week commencing October 20",media
It has officially been designated a Variant Under Investigation by the UK Health Security Agency,media
"So far, there is little evidence that we need to be overly concerned about this new subvariant; it has yet to show itself as being more infectious than the original Delta variant and there is nothing to suggest it will take over its parent as the dominant variant of the coronavirus",media
There is also no real evidence of it causing a severer illness or being any more evasive to the immune reaction stimulated by the vaccines,media
"Advertisement The advice around protecting ourselves from COVID remains the same: get vaccinated when offered, keep indoor spaces ventilated, wear a mask in crowded spaces and maintain good hand hygiene",media
"Good news: US approves vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds On October 29, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) released a statement approving the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include children aged five to 11 years old",media
"An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures – including vaccines – during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID pandemic",media
The decision came after a panel reviewed the data from a study looking at the effectiveness and safety of a low dose version of the Pfizer vaccine in this age group; the panel came to the conclusion ( PDF ) that the benefits of getting the vaccine outweighed any potential risks,media
"In the US, children aged five to 11 make up 39 percent of COVID cases in under-18s",media
"The ongoing study, conducted with approximately 3,100 children in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain, showed that five- to 11-year-olds had a similar immune response to the vaccine as those aged 16 to 25, and that the vaccine was 90",media
7 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 in this younger age group,media
"While no serious side effects have been detected, commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite",media
More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first,media
These were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days of the vaccination,media
Most went away within one to two days,media
"Advertisement The Pfizer vaccine has been linked to inflammation of the heart muscle and its lining in young men, but the study showed no such side effect in five- to 11-year-olds, although the study was relatively small and is ongoing",media
"Although COVID is generally not as serious a condition in children as it is in adults, there have been 440 deaths of children and teens aged five to 18 from the virus in the US since the start of the pandemic",media
This may seem like a relatively small number but it is worth pointing out that we do not see high numbers of deaths in this age group in developed countries from any infectious disease,media
"In the US, children aged five to 11 make up 39 percent of COVID cases in those below 18",media
"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children aged five to 11 resulted in hospitalisation",media
"Combined with the higher risk of infection posed by the Delta variant and the danger of Long COVID in children, the FDA has concluded that vaccinating this age group is in their best interests",media
Personal account: Should the UK be removing countries from its red list,media
"On the morning of November 1, 2021, the UK officially removed any remaining countries from its “red list”",media
"This meant travellers returning from Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Peru, Panama, Haiti and Venezuela will no longer have to quarantine in hotels",media
"Those arriving – fully vaccinated or below 18 years of age – do not need to complete a predeparture COVID test, a test on the eighth day after arriving, or isolate for 10 days at home",media
"With COVID cases in the UK so high in comparison to many of our neighbouring countries, we are likely to be exporting more coronavirus than we are importing, but I remain concerned about our lax borders",media
Advertisement I fully empathise with the hardships the travel industry has had to endure during this pandemic,media
"It has been affected more than most – but speaking as a doctor, I remain concerned about the lack of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for people returning to the UK",media
Those who return from trips abroad or visit us here – provided they are fully vaccinated – need only do a lateral flow test on the second day after arrival,media
This then means they have to self-report the result to a government website,media
The onus is on the individual to report the correct result; there are no checks in place to see if tests are actually being done or if the result being reported is indeed the true reading,media
"I would like to think that most people will report their results honestly and book a RT-PCR test and isolate should their lateral flow test come back positive, but I know this will not be the case for everyone",media
My other concern is that the lack of routine RT-PCR testing for people arriving from overseas means we have less of a handle on any new variants that might inadvertently be imported in,media
We saw what happened when the Delta variant was allowed in through open borders earlier this year,media
My advice would have been to have kept the Day 2 RT-PCR testing in place rather than replace it with a self-reported lateral flow test,media
That way we could support the travel industry while keeping a closer eye on what was coming in through our borders,media
Only time will tell if the UK government’s current policy is the correct one,media
Advertisement Reader’s question: What is the Valneva COVID vaccine,media
"The Valneva vaccine, made by French company Valneva, is a proposed COVID-19 vaccine that is yet to complete trials",media
"The vaccine technology is more traditional in that it uses a similar technique to polio and flu vaccines, relying on an inactivated whole version of the coronavirus, which cannot replicate or cause disease",media
"After being inactivated, the virus is purified and combined with an adjuvant that helps stimulate an immune response",media
"The reason why there is such interest in this vaccine is that instead of just relying on the spike protein part of the virus – as the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines do – this one presents the whole virus to the immune system, meaning that, in theory, you get an immune response to the whole virus and not just part of it",media
This means that if a part of the actual coronavirus mutates in the future – as we have seen with emerging variants – your immune system will still recognise the unmutated parts and neutralise it,media
"The hope is that vaccines using this technology will be able to provide protection for longer, rather than needing to be reformulated to get ahead of new variants",media
"The results from trials so far have been promising, with good immune responses reported as well as no serious adverse effects",media
"Phase three trials are ongoing, but the UK has already ordered 100 million doses and countries like Australia have also expressed an interest",media
"If we have a vaccine that gets us ahead of any future variants that may emerge, it will indeed be a game-changer",media

"This historic event highlighted the growing recognition of the undeniable link between health and climate change, however it is important to note that the declaration is non-binding, but it does reflect a realisation that collective action is necessary to address the climate impact on health",media
"The Health Day served as a platform for health to take centre stage in climate negotiations, highlighting the critical role of the health sector in driving climate-resilient policies and sustainable development initiatives globally",media
"Image credit: Nigeria Health Watch In Nigeria, climate change is having an increasing influence, with far-reaching consequences for health and well-being",media
"One of the most serious consequences, is the potential impact on life expectancy",media
"Climate and health intersection Recent studies have shed light on the intricate relationship between climate change and health, especially its link to life expectancy rate",media

5-year decrease in life expectancy,media
"Nigeria has made significant progress in raising life expectancy, with both men and women’s rates showing a consistent upward increase over time",media
"According to a recent Bureau of Statistics report , women’s life expectancies increased from 56 to 57 years between 2020 and 2022, while men’s went from 54 to 55",media
"However, experts have warned that these gains could be reversed owing climate shocks like floods, droughts and heatwaves, as well as the role they play in exacerbating disease outbreaks",media
Image credit: Nigeria Health Watch Another way climate affects life expectancy is its impact on food production,media
Many agrarian communities continue to experience decreased rainfall which has led to crop failures and food shortages,media
"This has resulted in malnutrition and food insecurity , particularly among vulnerable populations, such as people in low-income settings with a disproportionate impact on women, children, and senior citizens",media
"Research conducted in Lagos revealed a significant impact of climate change on food crop production and yield between 1998 and 2018, resulting in a notable decline in overall production levels",media
"Increased temperature also creates a conducive environment for the proliferation of disease vectors such as mosquitoes, increasing the incidence of preventable vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever",media
"Similarly, changes in rainfall pattern which refers to the amount of rainfall and its frequency, and intensity, over the years can contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid",media

The aging population continues to put an increasing burden on healthcare,media
"Climate change will also have a greater impact on people’s health, and health differences will not decrease in the coming years",media
"The RIVM urged the government to be consistent with its healthcare policy and also consider how policy in other areas, like education, work, and housing, impacts people’s health",media
“The demand for care will continue to grow in the coming decades,media
"This requires sharp choices in healthcare,” The RIVM said",media
"With more people growing old healthily, the Netherlands needs to make an effort to ensure that elderly people can continue to participate in society",media
