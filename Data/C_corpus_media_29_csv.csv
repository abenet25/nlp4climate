"""UN sees life expectancy, education and income fall Skip to content Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather Newsletters UN sees life expectancy, education and income fall 8 September 2022 Share Save Stephanie Hegarty Population correspondent Share Save Getty Images Life expectancy is declining sharply in some countries Decades of progress in terms of life expectancy, education and economic prosperity have begun unravelling since the pandemic, a new UN report says. Over the past two years, nine out of 10 countries have slid backwards on the UN's Human Development Index. Covid-19, the war in Ukraine and the impact of climate change are blamed for putting global development in reverse. The Human Development Index was launched in 1990 in an effort to look beyond GDP as a measure of well-being. Switzerland sits at the top of the index this year with a life expectancy of 84 years, an average of 16.5 years spent in education and median salary of $66,000. At the other end of the scale is South Sudan where life expectancy is 55, people spend just 5.5 years in school on average and earn $768 a year. Setbacks in a majority of the 191 countries included in the index, especially in life expectancy, have taken development levels back to those seen in 2016, reversing a 30-year trend. In the US, for example, life expectancy at birth has dropped by more than two years since 2019. In other countries the decline is much higher. Over the years since the index was introduced, many countries have faced crises and slid backwards, but the global trend consistently moved upwards. Last year was the first time the index declined overall since calculations began and this year's results solidified that downward trend. The impact has been uneven though. Two-thirds of rich countries rebounded last year while most others continued to decline. This year's index is based on data from 2021. ""But the outlook for 2022 is grim,"" says Achim Steiner, one of its authors, who points out that more than 80 countries are facing problems paying off their national debt. ""Eighty countries being one step away from facing that kind of crisis is a very serious prospect,"" he says. ""We are seeing deep disruptions, the tail end of which will play out over a number of years."" """

UN figures indicate that 80% of people displaced by climate change are women. Roles as primary caregivers and providers of food and fuel make them more vulnerable when flooding and drought occur. The 2015 Paris Agreement has made specific provision for the empowerment of women, recognising that they are disproportionately impacted. Getty Images Millions in Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, Niger and the Central African Republic rely on Lake Chad In central Africa, where up to 90% of Lake Chad has disappeared , nomadic indigenous groups are particularly at risk. As the lake's shoreline recedes, women have to walk much further to collect water. ""In the dry season, men go to the towns... leaving women to look after the community,"" explains Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, coordinator of the Association of Indigenous Women and People of Chad (AFPAT). With dry seasons now becoming longer, women are working harder to feed and care for their families without support. ""They become more vulnerable... it's very hard work,"" Ibrahim recently told the 's 100 Women initiative. A global problem It is not just women in rural areas who are affected. Globally, women are more likely to experience poverty , and to have less socioeconomic power than men. This makes it difficult to recover from disasters which affect infrastructure, jobs and housing. Getty Images Shanika Reaux with her baby Tatiana were displaced by Hurricane Katrina After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, African American women were among the worst affected by flooding in Louisiana. As sea levels rise, low-lying cities like New Orleans will be increasingly at risk . ""In New Orleans, there was much higher poverty among the African American population before Katrina,"" says Jacquelyn Litt, professor of women's and gender studies at Rutgers University. ""More than half the poor families in the city were headed by single mothers,"" she told  News. "" are reliant on interdependent community networks for their everyday survival and resources. The displacement that happened after Katrina essentially eroded those networks. It places women and their children at much greater risk."" In the immediate aftermath of extreme events, emergency shelters can be inadequately equipped to support women. The Superdome, in which evacuees were temporarily housed after Hurricane Katrina, didn't have enough sanitary products for the women accommodated there. Getty Images Katrina impact: Women and children waiting to be evacuated outside the New Orleans Superdome Increased incidences of violence against women, including sexual assault and rape, have also been documented in the wake of disasters. 'Natural' disasters? Much as climate change is accelerated by human behaviours, the impact of weather and climate events is influenced by societal structures. Disasters do not affect all people equally. In the wake of the 2004 tsunami, an Oxfam report found that surviving men outnumbered women by almost 3:1 in Sri Lanka, Indonesia and India. While no one cause was clear, there were similar patterns across the region. Men were more likely to be able to swim, and women lost precious evacuation time trying to look after children and other relatives. Another study spanning 20 years noted that catastrophic events lowered women's life expectancy more than men; more women were being killed, or they were being killed younger. In countries where women had greater socioeconomic power, the difference reduced. Half the world In recognition of this vast disparity, governments and organisations working on climate change are gradually moving to include women's voices in policy and planning. AFP Women farmers in Durban protesting the impact of climate change on their livelihoods The UN has highlighted the need for gender sensitive responses to the impacts of climate change, yet the average representation of women in national and global climate negotiating bodies is below 30%. The numbers don't improve at the local level. ""Women are often not involved in the decisions made about the responses to climate change, so the money ends up going to the men rather than the women,"" environmental scientist Diana Liverman told the 's Science in Action programme on the World Service this week. As an author for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), whose reports influence climate change policy, Liverman has been monitoring the numbers of women involved. Twenty-five percent of those nominated to participate in the next report are women. ""IPCC has been very receptive to this and is actually discussing how they can support women better,"" explains Liverman. ""Women are half the world. It's important they participate in all major decisions,"" ""Climate change is not a fight for power,"" points out Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim, ""it's a fight for survival."" """

View all partners https://theconversation.com/five-ways-that-climate-change-threatens-human-health-242711 Link copied Share article As the UN’s climate summit, Cop29 , gets underway in Azerbaijan this week, the effect of climate change on human health is high on the agenda . And rightly so, amid some alarming emerging statistics. By the end of this century, climate change could be the cause of more than 3 million deaths per year (around five times as many annual deaths globally of HIV and Aids). A new report from a scientific review committee of experts called the Lancet Countdown highlights how globally people are facing “record-breaking threats” to their health as a consequence of climate change. The major climate risks include negative effects on food security (including production), spread of diseases, ecosystems, infrastructure and the economy. Despite having contributed the least to global emissions, Africa will be most affected by climate change. This is due to the fragile economics and exposure to extreme weather events across much of the continent. But all continents, including Europe , will be negatively affected. Everyone working in health needs to prepare for and be equipped to respond to the health consequences of the climate crisis. The Lancet highlights the opportunity “to redefine the social and environmental determinants of health”. These are the top five priorities when it comes to climate change and human health: 1. New and emerging infectious diseases Drastic environmental change increases the risk of catching deadly infectious diseases such as malaria, dengue and West Nile virus in new areas. Modelling shows that mosquito populations could move into different regions of Africa and South America, and into Europe . The parasitic ticks that transmit the Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus may move north from Africa into Europe as climate change takes hold. The threat of outbreaks of new and emerging infections, and pandemics, is increasing. In 2022, the World Health Organization warned that Ebola outbreaks around Africa are becoming more frequent due to climate change, as bats – the likely source of the virus – migrate and seek new habitats to breed. Infectious diseases are predicted to spread more easily due to climate change, and thus increase the risk of pandemics. This threat includes Lassa fever, a virus thought to be transmitted by rats. Modelling has indicated that the rats may flee fire and flood, find new habitats and thus expose greater numbers of humans to new or different viruses. 2. Food security and nutrition Climate change exacerbates food insecurity. In Ghana, West Africa, inconsistent rainfall during the 2024 rainy season has left an estimated 1.05 million people acutely food insecure. This is the case particularly in the north of the country, an area already with a high level of food insecurity and hunger. The UN predicts that more than 600 million people will be living in hunger by 2030, due to the impact of climate shocks and lack of aid and government action thus far. Climate change worsens food insecurity from many different angles; from rural farmers in Ghana losing their crops due to unexpected changes in rainfall, to the impact of affordability of imports in the UK, there won’t be just hunger hotspots. As food insecurity deteriorates, so will malnutrition globally. By 2030, between 570,000 and 1 million children under five years old will suffer from stunted growth due to climate change, also exacerbating their vulnerability to infectious diseases such as malaria. 3. Access to healthcare Extreme weather can physically prevent people from accessing healthcare. Between 2014 and 2023, 61% of land globally experienced an increase in the number of days of extreme rainfall, compared to 1961-1990. Flash floods have devastated Valencia in Spain, with health services anticipating increases in diarrhoea, skin infections and hepatitis A. Evidence from Ghana shows that physical access to healthcare is restricted, with patients and sometimes health workers unable to reach local health centres, and emergency referrals unable to reach hospitals. Access to healthcare provision becomes harder during extreme weather conditions. Riccardo Mayer/Shutterstock The Lancet report also found that only two-thirds of countries had high or very high implementation of legally required health emergency plans. This number needs to be 100% to protect population health as extreme weather events become more frequent, unpredictable and severe. Delays to reduce carbon emissions and attempt to rectify the situation are only adding to the issue. Global energy-related carbon emissions reached a new high in 2023, showing little signs of slowing down. In a 2023 study conducted in Mion (northern Ghana), nearly all participants reported not being able to access a healthcare facility when they needed to at least once, due to climatic conditions. Similarly, in the Volta region in Ghana, many residents lost all their belongings during unexpected flooding in 2023 including health insurance documents. This means people cannot access vital medications or services such as insulin if diabetic, or emergency care. 4. Air quality Air quality is one of the most locally-felt impacts of climate change, especially in heavily industrialised countries. The UK Health Security Agency estimates that around 36,000 deaths annually are attributable to air pollution in the UK, with this number jumping to 2 million in China . This is in part due to causing new, or exacerbating existing, chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which one in five people suffer with in the UK. It also reduces life expectancy through prolonged exposure, causing diseases such as coronary heart disease and lung cancer. 5. Extreme heat In 2023, increased heat exposure put those engaged in outdoor physical activity (which includes everything from agricultural labour to recreational running) at risk of heat stress for 28% more hours than two decades ago. Heat stress has been associated with debilitating issues such as kidney stones, exhaustion, asthma and heart attacks. Any amount of activity or movement in rising temperatures will put individuals at great risk of these conditions. This will compromise income if labour is based outdoors, population health if we can do less outside, and the ability to enjoy the outdoor world.

"""How to live forever Skip to content Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Home News Sport Business Innovation Culture Arts Travel Earth Audio Video Live Weather Newsletters How to live forever 21 April 2014 Share Save Frank Swain Features correspondent Share Save (Thinkstock) If more and more people are living past 100, how much older can we survive to, in theory, asks Frank Swain. And what would it take to achieve this in practice? On the Art of Prolonging Life was penned by a Dr Huseland (“one of the soundest minds in Germany”) in 1797, concluding eight years of study on the topic. He identified among the many factors associated with long life: a moderate diet that was rich in vegetables and short on meat and sweetened pastries; an active lifestyle; good care of your teeth; weekly bathing in lukewarm water with soap; good sleep; clean air; and being born to parents who themselves lived long lives. Toward the end of his essay, translated for the American Review, the doctor wistfully speculated that “human life may be prolonged to double the extent of what is supposed to be its present limits, without losing activity and usefulness.” By Huseland’s estimates, half of all children born would die before their tenth birthday, an alarmingly high mortality rate. However, if the child could run the gauntlet of youth fraught with smallpox, measles, rubella, and other childhood diseases, they stood a fair chance of making it all the way to their mid-thirties. In ideal circumstances, Huseland thought it possible that a lifetime could stretch for two hundred years. Is there more to these claims than the fanciful imagination of an 18th century doctor? James Vaupel doesn’t think it’s out of the question. “Life expectancy is increasing two-and-a-half years every decade,” he says. “That’s twenty five years every century.” As director of the Laboratory of Survival and Longevity at the Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research in Rostock, Germany, Vaupel studies longevity and survival in human and animal populations. He tells me that the pattern of improvements to mortality has shifted greatly in the past 100 years. Before 1950, most of the gains in life expectancy were made by combating the high infant mortality that Huseland noted. Since then, however, it’s been the over-60s and most recently the over-80s who’ve seen the greatest decreases in mortality. In other words, we are not just surviving childhood in greater numbers, we’re living longer – a lot longer. Age complex Worldwide, the number of centenarians – people over the age of 100 – is predicted to increase 10-fold between 2010 and 2050. As Huseland testified, a strong component in whether you’ll live to see this milestone lies in the age of your parents; that is, there is a genetic component to long life. But the rise in centenarians can’t be explained by genetics alone, which clearly haven’t changed much in the last couple of centuries. Rather, it’s a host of improvements to our lives that cumulatively improve our chances of living longer and stronger, many of which echo the factors identified by Huseland. The reasons include better healthcare, improving medical treatments, public health measures like cleaner water and air, better education, and improved standards of living such as houses that are warm and dry. “Mostly it’s down to having more medicine and money,” says Vaupel. Recent decades have seen significant improvements in life expectancy for the elderly (Thinkstock) Nonetheless, the gains offered by better healthcare and living conditions still leave many people dissatisfied, and the appetite for life-extension therapies shows no sign of abating. One popular approach is caloric restriction. In the 1930s, researchers noticed that mice fed on a near-starvation diet lived far longer than those allowed to eat until full. A subsequent study on rhesus monkeys also showed this, but this was contradicted by a 20-year-long study by the US National Institute on Ageing, which found that although rhesus monkeys kept on a calorie-restricted diet developed age-related diseases slightly later than controls, they did not live longer on average. The authors noted that though caloric restriction in long-lived animals conferred some benefits, these were subject to a complex interplay of genetics, nutrition and environmental factors. Another great hope is resveratrol, a chemical produced naturally by plants, notably in the skin of grapes. Whether vineyards can be said to hide the fountain of youth, however, remains doubtful. The chemical has been noted to produce similar health benefits to caloric restriction in animal models, but as yet, no study has shown that taking resveratrol can increase human lifespan. No limits But why do we age at all? “Every day we suffer damage and don’t perfectly repair it,” explains Vaupel, “and this accumulation of unrepaired damage is what causes age-related disease.” It’s not a trait that is shared by all living organisms. Hydra for example – a group of simple, jellyfish-like creatures – are able to repair almost all the damage they suffer, and readily slough cells that are too injured to heal. In humans, it’s damaged cells like these that can give rise to cancerous tumours. “Hydras allocate resources primarily toward repair, rather than reproduction,” says Vaupel. “Humans, by contrast, primarily direct resources toward reproduction, it’s a different survival strategy at a species level.” Humans may live fast and die young, but our prodigious fertility allows us to overcome these high mortality rates. Now that infant mortality is so low, there’s really no need to channel so many resources into reproduction, says Vaupel. “The trick is to up-regulate repair instead of diverting that energy into getting fat. In theory that should be possible, though nobody has any idea about how to do it.” If the steady accretion of damage to our cells can be arrested – so-called negligible senescence – then perhaps we won’t have an upper age limit. If that’s the case, there isn’t any reason why we should have to die at all. Hydra can repair almost all its damaged cells, shedding any that are too injured to heal (Science Photo Library) “It would be wonderful to get to a world where all death is optional. Right now, essentially all of us are sentenced to the death penalty, even though most of us have done nothing to deserve it.” So says Gennady Stolyarov, transhumanist philosopher and author of Death Is Wrong, a controversial children’s book that encourages young minds to reject the fatalist notion that death is inevitable. Stolyarov is fervently opposed to what he sees is simply a technological challenge waiting for the appropriate level of money and manpower to solve it. Agents of change One focus for technological intervention are telomeres. These caps on chromosomes shorten every time your cells divide, putting a hard limit on the number of times your cells can reproduce themselves. Not all animals experience this telomere shortening, the hydra being one of them. However, there are good reasons to have these limitations in place. Occasional mutations can allow cells to divide without shortening their telomeres, giving rise to “immortal” cell lines. However, in an uncontrolled situation, these immortal cells would be very bad news for the person they are in, bloating into cancerous tumours. “One hundred and fifty thousand people in the world die each day , two thirds of those die from causes related to senescence,” Stolyarov tells me. “So even if we can hasten the arrival of these technologies to achieve negligible senescence by one day, we will have saved a hundred thousand lives.” The author quotes geronotology theoretician Aubrey de Grey – something of a celebrity in the world of life extension – as stating that there is a 50% chance of achieving negligible senescence in the next 25 years . “There’s a good chance that it will happen in our lifetimes, before we experience the most deleterious effects of senescence,” says Stolyarov. “Achieving negligible human senescence in 25 years is possible,” says Vaupel, “but highly unlikely.” He concedes that it might be possible to rapidly accelerate life expectancy through medical breakthroughs. But he warns that equally, there may be difficulties in the future that we don’t anticipate. “Disease, economic crisis, and climate change might cause increases in mortality,” he says. Telomeres, the protective ends of chromosomes, are linked to ageing of cells (Science Photo Library) Stolyarov is hoping to kindle a small spark of hope into an eternal flame. “What I think is necessary right now is a determined push to dramatically accelerate the pace of technological progress,” he says. “We have a fighting chance right now, but in order to make it happen we have to be the agents of change.” For now, readers will have to take comfort in the knowledge that there are well-documented ways to try to avoid the Western world’s two biggest killers – heart disease and cancer – through a combination of exercise, healthy eating, and moderation when it comes to alcohol and red meat. Very few of us actually manage to live by these criteria, perhaps because we think a shorter life filled with rich food and wine is a worthy trade. Which leads to the conundrum – if eternal life was possible, would you be willing to pay the price?"""

But this is set to change. Declining fertility rates and increasing life expectancy mean that by 2050, the number of people over 60 in Africa is projected to triple to 235 million (about 9% of the African population). This demographic shift is occurring when global climate change is intensifying, leading to more frequent and severe extreme weather events such as heatwaves, flooding and tropical cyclones. By 2050, older adults in Africa are projected to face significantly higher heat exposure due to rapid population growth and climate change, with an increase in extreme heat events. This will heighten health risks and put pressure on local services, especially in low-income areas with limited ability to cope with the strain. As we age, it gets harder to control body temperature . Longtime health issues like heart and lung disease and diabetes make older people more likely to become dehydrated. In Africa, many older people struggle to get the physical, mental, social and financial support they need to cope with the direct and indirect effects of extreme weather. Urgent strategies are therefore needed to protect older people from extreme weather such as heatwaves. These include cooling infrastructure (air conditioning) and early warning systems that tell older people when it is getting dangerously hot. Climate change adaptation plans must be integrated with policies on ageing to protect older people. I research climate gerontology – the intersection between ageing and climate change . As part of my research I am undertaking a series of Global Ageing and Climate Change Regional Dialogues in collaboration with HelpAge International . Here are the key issues we found in Africa. Climate change is harsh on older people Older people vary in health and mobility. Some older individuals remain active and healthy, allowing them to cope better with the disruptions caused by extreme weather. Other, less active older adults tend to be vulnerable to climate-related threats because of weaker physical health, reduced mobility and higher risk of existing disease. Heat can be deadly for older people. Adam Kaz/Getty Images In Africa, older people are at greater risk because the continent has limited basic infrastructure. This is especially the case in rural areas, where access to healthcare, clean water and emergency services is often poor. Poverty, living alone, and depending on small-scale farming make them even more susceptible to extreme weather. The impact of climate change disproportionately affects the continent, resulting in severe floods , droughts and unprecedented heatwaves. In 2023 alone , about 15,700 people were killed in extreme weather disasters in Africa, and a further 34 million people affected. Storm Daniel caused widespread devastation in Libya , displacing 2.4 million people. Kenya , Somalia and Ethiopia experienced intense rainfall and flooding. Northern Africa faced record-breaking heat, with temperatures reaching 49.0°C in Tunisia and 50.4°C in Algeria. Severe droughts hit Morocco, Algeria and Zambia, affecting millions. Prolonged droughts and crop failures make food shortages worse and mean that older people are unable to access healthy, nutritious food. Floods contribute to displacement and difficulties in accessing healthcare, resulting in stress and anxiety. Older people are also affected by the digital divide . Not having as much access to digital tools like smartphones means they cannot always get the information they need. They may not be able to see climate change education programmes, or get early warnings of extreme weather. Solutions Traditional knowledge: This is the understanding and practices that older people in Africa have gained over generations about their local environment. It includes knowing about climate patterns, resource use and disaster preparedness. Recognising this valuable knowledge can help communities adapt to climate change and strengthen local community resilience. Regular assessments: Local authorities and community organisations must monitor how older people are coping with climate impacts. This will lead to more effective adaptation strategies that make use of their insights. Healthy ageing: Older people need support to take care of their bodies, minds and social lives so that they can stay active and remain independent. Healthy ageing helps prevent illness and disabilities, and allows older adults to connect with communities and cope with extreme weather. One-stop shops for older people: These should be set up by community-based organisations, charities and government agencies to provide services such as financial assistance, healthcare and nutrition support specifically tailored for older people. They could also train older people to adapt to climate change. Involve older people in climate adaptation: Through their local organisations, older people should be involved in disaster risk reduction plans. Older people have already played vital roles in climate adaptation efforts across Africa. In Kenya, their mobilisation for national tree planting initiatives shows what a great contribution older people can make to the environment. A group of different generations also works together in Kenya on Agriculture for the Aged – planting climate-resilient crops to cope with unpredictable weather patterns. Policy changes needed For these solutions to become a reality, policies, and budgets are needed. First, policymakers should consult older people and their representatives when they draw up climate resilience strategies. Region-specific strategies are best. For example, when setting up community-based early warning systems for extreme weather events, local authorities could work with non-governmental organisations to create a system that provides timely alerts aimed at older people. Second, age-friendly infrastructure , such as accessible healthcare facilities and housing that can withstand extreme weather, must be set up. Read more: Why older people are some of those worst affected by climate change Third, stronger laws and political commitment will result in stronger policies for older people. The lack of political will often results in insufficient attention and resources being allocated to the needs of older people in climate action . Without strong commitment from policymakers, older populations are frequently overlooked. This limits their ability to adapt effectively. Fourth, social protection systems such as cash transfer programmes must be improved to give financial help to vulnerable older people. Programmes that provide direct support and jobs in projects that protect against climate impacts are also a good idea. To make this happen, governments and institutions must start collecting more data on how older people are affected by climate change. By developing inclusive policies, we can promote healthy ageing while empowering older adults to play an active role in building climate resilience. """

These consequences are now starting to come to fore. Several examples have recently played out. For example, in Russia, an anthrax outbreak in the remote region of Siberia meant that nomadic communities and thousands of reindeer were affected. The outbreak was due to the bodies of infected people buried in 1941 defrosting and releasing anthrax spores into the water system as the permafrost defrosts with global warming. Closer to home, prisoners are starving in Malawian jails and suffering from acute severe malnutrition as a result of food shortages due to erratic climate conditions from both droughts and floods. Malawi has since declared a state of national disaster. These unanticipated public health consequences of unsustainable development reminds the world that the issues are not in the distant future, but instead face us now. Climate change exerts its influence on public health through three main mechanisms. First, the effects of extreme weather events such as heat, storms, floods or fire that directly cause loss of life or illness. Second, there are indirect effects of climate change on natural systems. This leads to, for example, changes in disease vectors such as mosquitoes that spread malaria, availability of fresh water, crop survival, or the concentration of pollen in the air. Third, the effects on economic and social systems as people migrate or conflict over scarce resources. These effects can be moderated by the presence of early warning systems and effective disaster and emergency medical services. More affluent communities with more resources will be better able to adapt and withstand these effects. Having strong primary healthcare systems will also increase the resilience of communities. But in sub-Saharan Africa many communities do not have these protective mechanisms in place, and will be particularly vulnerable to the impact of climate change. Electricity pylons in front of cooling towers at the Lethabo Thermal Power Station, an Eskom coal-burning power station near Sasolburg in the northern Free State province. /Siphiwe Sibeko Disease and environmental health The World Health Organisation has recently published a new report on the burden of disease due to modifiable environmental risks . The report estimates that 23% of all deaths globally can be attributed to environmental risks. This percentage rises to 26% in children. These environmental risks include: air, water and soil pollution; ultraviolet radiation; the built environment; the occupational environment; agricultural methods; and climate and ecosystem changes. Children, the elderly, and those living in low- and middle-income countries are most at risk. The diseases that make the greatest environmentally attributable contribution to the global burden of disease are stroke, ischaemic heart disease, diarrhoea, lower respiratory tract infection, cancers and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. And over the last ten years the contribution of non-communicable diseases has significantly increased. An example in South Africa is from Mpumalanga’s Highveld, which has 12 coal fired power stations. The collective air pollution from these power stations has been reported as being responsible for just over half of the deaths from respiratory disease and cardiovascular disease in the area. Living differently Sustainable development has been defined as: … development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. The United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals recognise that improving the wellbeing and health of people requires an approach that protects the planet from degradation. This is required because there are ecological limits to development that is based on ever-increasing consumption. But the climate crisis is just one of the manifestations of the world’s collective inability to live sustainably. There is also a loss of ecosystems and the biodiversity. This compromises the natural services they render to humanity: food, fresh water, clean air, building materials and even new medicines. Economic inequality is increasing. It is reported that 62 people now own as much wealth as 50% of the planet’s population. At the same time, we have seen unprecedented population growth and increasing urbanisation that is characterised by the growth of slums or informal settlements . The 21st-century challenge Humanity’s biggest challenge in the 21st century may be its ability to find a way of living sustainably and to tackle the crises of both planetary and public health. This will require action on a global scale by world leaders and by a change in collective consciousness. There are some encouraging signs. Brazil has joined China and the US in ratifying the Paris agreement on tackling climate change. China and the US are responsible for 38% of global emissions. World religious leaders have also joined forces to promote a change of consciousness as part of a “ season of creation ”.

EPA https://theconversation.com/ghanas-health-system-isnt-quite-ready-for-climate-change-realities-122912 Link copied Share article Climate change has been labelled as the greatest public health risk of the 21st century. Health risks from climate change are expected to become increasingly severe in the coming years. They threaten the many advances being made in global public health. Several health risks are anticipated from climate change. These include increases of vector-borne and diarrhoeal diseases. There are also changes in the geographic range of infectious diseases. This means a spread into new regions, the emergence of new infectious diseases and reemergence of old ones. An increase in the intensity of infectious diseases in already endemic regions is also expected. Although climate change is a global threat, the potential risks are relatively higher in developing economies. These countries have overburdened and weak health systems, coupled with persistently poor health infrastructure. It’s anticipated that some of the worst effects of climate change will be felt in sub-Saharan Africa . For example, climatic change has been reported as a driving force for the malaria highland invasion in the East African highlands. It is crucial that countries’ public health systems are able to cope with climate sensitive diseases. The World Health Organisation (WHO) has acknowledged this and has outlined a range of mitigating measures. It identifies rebuilding public health capacity among the most important, cost-effective and urgent responses to climate change. This includes training in climate change and health to strengthen the technical and professional capacity of health personnel. Effective surveillance and emergency response systems also need to be put in place, coupled with sustainable prevention and control programmes. In addition, countries need to design national health adaptation strategies, implement programmes to mitigate the health eﬀects of climate change, and strengthen institutional capacities to address the health effects of climate change. I set out to study whether Ghana’s health system and health workers are prepared for the potential health risks linked to climate change. These risks include possible outbreaks of communicable diseases like meningococcal meningitis and cholera. The research The research focused on two districts located in different ecological zones. The areas, located in the southern and northern zones, were chosen to account for different perspectives. The focus of the research was on the capacity and preparedness towards climate related health emergencies as it relates to climate sensitive infectious diseases. Capacity and preparedness were assessed in two ways. First, I looked at whether programmes had been strengthened for professional health personnel to equip them to address potential climate related health risks. This could include human resource skill building and education. I also assessed the ability of health services to respond to potential emergencies from climate sensitive infectious diseases, emergency preparedness and management. In-depth interviews and surveys were carried out among health professionals within public health facilities located in the two districts. Potential climate change health emergency risks that relate to climate sensitive infectious diseases within the Ghanaian context were assessed in both districts. The questions related only to known health risks and diseases. The study showed that there were no capacity strengthening programmes for health workers to equip them to address potential climate related health risks. Over 80% of respondents from both study districts reported not receiving training or workshops targeted towards climate change and health. As a result, 65% of respondents in each district reported not having enough information to respond to climate related public health threats. Respondents gave contrasting views on the issue of emergency preparedness and management. Some said they were prepared to address potential climate health risks and emergencies. Others said they weren’t. Respondents who indicated unpreparedness bemoaned the challenges they faced in delivering even basic health services. They concluded that they were not ready to deal with the impact of climate change on local populations’ health. On the other hand, some respondents specified having the needed support, the necessary human resources and strategies in place to help address the health threats from climate change. The study also showed that the position of a health facility on the hierarchical structure affected its capacity and preparedness levels. Health workers interviewed within the higher level of health delivery (district hospitals) acknowledged some level of preparedness to deal with climate health emergencies compared to those at the lower level (health centres). Both levels nevertheless declared they might have challenges in addressing climate change health emergencies. Overall, the study ﬁndings indicate that health systems capacity and preparedness levels towards climate change health risks didn’t diﬀer across the study contexts. Way forward Our study also shed light on the urgent need for reforms to combat the looming health impact of climate change. The findings call for vital measures to be put in place in terms of health systems adaptation planning and resilience building. It became apparent that knowledge, skill building, provision of logistics and infrastructure urgently need attention. There is also a need to provide more resources, especially at the local levels. In addition, health professionals require in-service training programmes on climate change and health needs. Training and education are key to improving preparedness and capacity. """

View all partners https://theconversation.com/climate-change-is-making-it-harder-for-people-to-get-the-care-they-need-240557 Link copied Share article The world is witnessing the consequences of climate change: long-lasting changes in temperature and rainfall, and more intense and frequent extreme weather events such as heat waves, hurricanes, typhoons, flooding and drought. All make it harder for families and communities to meet their care needs. Climate change affects care systems in various ways. First, sudden illnesses and unexpected disabilities heighten the need for care. Second, it reduces access to important inputs for care such as water, food and safe shelter. Third, it can damage physical and social care infrastructures. It can also lead to breakdowns of traditional units of caregiving such as households and communities. And it creates new situations of need with the increase in displaced person settlements and refugee camps. Climate change creates sudden spikes in the demand for care, and serious challenges to meeting the growing need for care. All this has immediate and long lasting effects on human well-being. The size of the current unmet care needs throughout the world is substantial. In childcare alone, about 23% of children worldwide – nearly 350 million – need childcare but do not have it. Families in low- and lower-middle-income countries are the most in need. Similarly, as the world’s population ages rapidly, only a small proportion of the elderly who need assistance are able to use formal care (in an institution or paid homecare). Most are cared for by family members or other unpaid caregivers. Much of this unpaid care and formal care work is provided by women and girls. Hundreds of millions of people around the world struggle to get healthcare. Expansion of access to essential health services has slowed compared to pre-2015 . And healthcare costs still create financial hardship. Without comprehensive public and global support for care provision and the integration of care in the climate agenda, unmet care needs will only grow and inequalities will widen. Impact Climate change interacts with human health in complex ways. Its impact is highly uneven across populations. It depends on geographical region, income, education, gender roles, social norms, level of development, and the institutional capacity and accessibility of health systems. In 2018-22, Africa experienced the biggest increase in the heat-related mortality rate since 2000-05 . This is not surprising as the continent has more frequent health-threatening temperatures than ever before and a growing population of people older than 65. Africa is also the region most affected by droughts in 2013-22, with 64% of its land area affected by at least one month of extreme drought per year on average. It was followed by Oceania (55% of its land area) and South and Central America (53%). Scientific evidence also points to increases in health inequalities caused by climate change. The health effects of climate change are not uniformly felt by different population groups. Exposure, severity of impact, and ability of individuals to recover depend on a variety of factors . Physiological characteristics, income, education, type of occupation, location, social norms and health systems are some of them. For example, older people and young children face the greatest health risks from high temperatures. There is also evidence of the disproportionate effect of climate change on the health of people living in poverty and those who belong to disadvantaged groups. Women of lower social and economic status and with less education are more vulnerable to heat stress compared to women in wealthier households and with higher education or social status. They are exposed to pollution in the absence of clean cooking fuel, and to extreme heat as they walk to gather water and fuel, or do other work outdoors. Bad sanitation in poor urban areas increases the incidence of water-borne diseases after heavy rains and floods . Lack of access to healthcare services and the means to pay for medicines make it difficult for women and men in low-income households to recover from illness, heat strokes, and air pollution-related ailments. Mental health problems are being attributed to climate change as well . Studies show that the loss of family or kin member, home, livelihood and a safe environment can bring about direct emotional impacts. These adverse impacts increase the demand for caregiving and the care workload. Climate-induced health problems force family and community caregivers, particularly women, to spend more time looking after the sick and disabled, particularly frail elderly people and children. Effect on food and water Climate change threatens the availability of food, clean water and safe shelter. It erodes households’ and communities’ care capacity and hence societies’ ability to thrive. Fluctuations in food supply and rising food prices as a result of environmental disasters, along with the inadequacy of government policies, underscore the mounting challenge of meeting food needs . The threat of chronic shortage of safe drinking water has also risen. Water scarcity is an area where structural inequalities and gender disparities are laid bare. Care for the sick and disabled, the young and the elderly is compromised when water is scarce. Effects on providing care Extreme weather events disrupt physical care infrastructures. It may be hard to reach hospitals, clinics, daycare centres, nursery schools and nursing homes. Some facilities may be damaged and have to close. Another type of care system that can break down is family networks and support provided by friends and neighbours. These informal care sharing arrangements are illustrated in a study of the three large informal settlements in Nairobi. About half (50.5%) of the sampled households reported having had a sick member in the two weeks before the survey. The majority relied on close friends and family members living nearby for care and support. Studies have shown that climate change eventually leads to livelihood loss and resource scarcity, which can weaken social cohesion and local safety nets in affected communities. Heightened risks and uncertainty and imminent changes in socio-economic and political conditions can also compel individuals or entire households to migrate. Migration is caused by a host of factors, but it has increasingly been a climate-related response. The World Bank’s Groundswell Report released in 2018 , for example, projected that climate change could force 216 million people to move within their countries by 2050 to avoid the slow-onset impacts of climate change. A possible consequence of migration is the withdrawal of care support provided by the migrating extended kin, neighbours or friends, increasing the caregiving load of people left behind. In the case of forced displacements, the traditional social networks existing in communities are disrupted entirely. What’s needed There are compelling reasons to believe that meeting care needs can also help mitigate the effects of climate change. And actions to meet carbon-zero goals, prevent biodiversity loss and regenerate ecosystems can reduce the care work burden that falls heavily on families, communities and women. Any effort to tackle these grave problems should be comprehensive in scope and must be based on principles of equality, universality, and responsibility shared by all .

Pictured: the aftermath of Typhoon Haiyan. DFID - UK Department for International Development/Flickr , CC BY https://theconversation.com/climate-change-will-widen-the-social-and-health-gap-30105 Link copied Share article Climate projections suggest that, thanks to human activity, we will likely see an increase in extreme weather events, disruptions to agriculture, loss of livelihoods and displacement of people. While everyone will be affected, these climate impacts will exacerbate social and health inequities, depending on underlying economic, geographic, social and health status. Recently there’s been increasing attention on climate change and health, including calls from Australian scientists , led by Professor Peter Doherty, for the government to put climate change on the G20 agenda. My research focuses on social inequality, and how that might exacerbate climate changes impact on health inequalities, including vulnerability to extreme weather and rising food prices. I presented some of the latest research on this topic at a recent Australian Academy of Science symposium on climate and health. Inequities of man-made natural disasters Low-lying cities and towns near coasts are facing increased risks from more frequent and more intense cyclones. These storms can generate storm surges causing flooding, direct injury and damage to infrastructure, including housing, water and sanitation systems. Poorer households are usually at higher direct health risk due to weaker structures, less safe locations and building sites, and the weaker resilience of infrastructure in poorer cities and towns to withstand damage. At the end of 2013, the Philippines were hit by devastating super typhoon Haiyan, which affected 16 million people. 6,069 people were reported dead while 4.1 million people were displaced, with 1.1 million houses damaged or destroyed. While everyone was touched by the typhoon, large income inequalities meant that poorer people not only lived in poorer quality housing, they were also more likely to be living on cheaper land in vulnerable low-lying regions . Poorer households also often lack the economic resources to evacuate in the face of climate-related disasters, or to rebuild. The ﬂooding of New Orleans in 2005 gave a striking example of what can happen among socially disadvantaged communities. Elderly patients in homes and poor people could not evacuate in front of the storm because of lack of transport. We see similar issues with heatwaves . Lower socioeconomic and minority ethnic groups are more likely to live and work in warmer neighbourhoods and in buildings that are poorly ventilated and absorb heat. This increases the risk of heat stress and heat deaths . Poor neighbourhoods with weak infrastructure, buildings and unplanned developments with little green spaces are likely to be more exposed to high temperatures compared to more affluent neighbourhoods. Impacts on agriculture Our agricultural systems are also under threat. Increasing drought periods in Australia may challenge the viability of agriculture in some regions, and hence those communities that depend on primary production. This will affect people’s income, stress levels and sense of hope. In 2003 bushfires ravaged eastern Victoria, destroying more than 40 homes and killing thousands of cattle. But the bushfires exacerbated problems already present in the community, typical of other rural Australian communities. Economic and climate pressures on rural farming communities has created financial hardship, led to closures in local businesses, and young people moving away. This has transformed the social landscape and support that is often present within rural communities. These factors we know have real implications for mental health and may increase risk of suicidal thoughts. Climate change also exacerbates food insecurity. Modelling estimates suggest that between 2005 and 2007 there was a 33% increase in the price of vegetables and a 43% increase in fruit prices in Australia because of the drought and extreme weather events. Rising food prices most affect the poor — as a proportion of total household expenditure, food makes up an average of around 19%. But, with 12% of Australians living below the poverty line, these average figures hide some of the food security difficulties many Australians face. Climate pressures will widen the food gap between those able to maintain a healthy diet of fresh produce, fish, lean meat and so on, and those needing to find the cheapest sources of calories. Cheap calories are found in the most highly processed, long shelf-life products, containing hardened fats and bulk starches, preserved with sugar or salt. Where does inequality come from? Climate change throws into sharp relief many of the issues to do with inequities in living standards, resource use, levels of exposure to environmental stresses, and existing health inequities. Australians who are more socially disadvantaged (by income, employment status, education) and Indigenous Australians are more likely to die younger and have a higher risk of depression, diabetes, heart disease and cancers. Parts of our cities are marked by concentrations of long term unemployment, low levels of education, and poor and dangerous housing conditions, leading to poor physical and mental health outcomes. The health experience of people living in rural and remote Australia is often worse than the urban average. Climate change itself is a product of the same forces that have created inequality in different groups of people. In creating a global marketplace that depends upon ever-increasing volumes of production and consumption, the economic and social trajectory of the 20th century and beyond has led to increasing over-exploitation of finite natural resources and to overloading natural environmental systems. The best way to address the unequal effects of climate change is address the causes of climate change and inequality. This might include : fairer and more sustainable food systems; affordable quality housing; pensions and benefits set no lower than the poverty line and indexed to average wages; and the establishment of more quality job creation programs in priority areas. This will not only improve health, but advances will be made in social equity such that communities and nations will be better able to resist current climate change and avert further damage to the environment.

Gains from net zero are often presented as global benefits and mainly for future generations. But less fossil fuel use also means less air pollution which results in local health gains right away. For example, rapid health gains are predicted from policies for US net zero by 2050. By 2035, between 4,000 to 15,000 fewer US residents would die annually from air pollution, saving the US economy $65bn to $128bn , with even greater benefits thereafter. A study , led by Imperial College London, has found that there are large health gains from UK net zero actions. Dr Mike Holland, who was part of the study team, said: “Fundamental changes required for net zero will bring long lasting benefits to UK health. Or turn that around. If we don’t take the net zero path, we will be sicker. This would be a double own goal on both climate and health.” The researchers looked at the net zero pathways for transport and buildings in the UK’s sixth carbon budget . Health improvements came about from less air pollution and also increased exercise from more walking, cycling and e-biking. By 2060 the economic gains from fewer deaths would amount to £26bn-£31bn. New evidence meant they were also able to estimate gains from less illness too; around £20bn adding to the economic benefits from net zero . Some gains would be expected straight away, as air pollution decreased. These include fewer new cases of asthma in children and adults, as well as reduced hospital admissions for breathing and heart problems. This is consistent with recent health improvements that followed Bradford’s clean air zone and others around Europe . Fewer strokes and heart attacks would emerge more slowly over five years as air pollution started to reduce. For lung cancer, the reduction in cases would be expected to lag air pollution improvements by six to 20 years. But the gains would not stop in 2060. Children born in the 2050s would suffer from fewer air pollution illnesses as they grew up and aged as adults. Although less certain than the other illnesses studied, the greatest long-term gains could be in cases of dementia. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion Walking, cycling and e-biking as part of net zero, would also lead to health gains. Prof Christian Brand, part of the study team, said: “If transport decarbonisation focuses mainly on commuting, how much health improvement and emissions reduction are we leaving on the table? Without policies that support all forms of mobility – especially the short, everyday trips that reduce car dependency – are we missing a crucial opportunity to maximize the full benefits of net zero?” Participation is key to maximising these gains across society, especially amongwomen and older people. The study found that people walking or cycling for transport could expect to an average of five and half months longer life expectancy, and a healthier life. """

Photograph: Chris Clor/Getty Images; Tetra images RF This article is more than 1 year old I thought most of us were going to die from the climate crisis. I was wrong This article is more than 1 year old In an extract from her book Not the End of the World, data scientist Hannah Ritchie explains how her work taught her that there are more reasons for hope than despair about climate change – and why a truly sustainable world is in reach Hannah Ritchie Q&A: ‘Doomsday predictions are a dream for climate deniers’ “Scientists say temperatures could rise by 6C by 2100 and call for action ahead of UN meeting in Paris” – Independent , 2015. A world that was 6C warmer than it is today would be devastating. And remember, 6C is just the average. Some parts of the world would get much warmer, especially the poles. Crops would fail. Many people would be malnourished. Forests would be stripped back into savannahs. Island nations would be completely submerged. Many cities will have disappeared due to sea-level rise. Climate refugees will be on the move. “Normal” temperatures in many parts of the world would be unbearable. Even the richest, most temperate nations would see devastating floods most winters and baking summers. We would be at very high risk of setting off warming feedback loops – the melted ice would reflect less sunlight, the melted permafrost might unlock methane from the bottom of the ocean, and dying forests wouldn’t be able to regrow to suck carbon out of the atmosphere. A 6C warmer world might be short-lived – it could quickly spiral into 8C, 10C or more. It would be a massive humanitarian disaster. Only a few years ago, I thought this was where we were headed. Forget 1.5C or 2C – we were destined for 4C, 5C or 6C and there was nothing we could do about it. Most people still think that this is the path we’re following. Thankfully, it’s not. In 2015, I went to Paris for the big, famous climate conference, Cop21. Representatives and policymakers from every country came together to hash out a new climate deal. The previous goal of the international agreement was to keep the global average temperature rise below 2C by the end of the century. So I couldn’t believe it when there were rumours that a target of 1.5C was being discussed. Were they crazy? At that point, I had already given up on the prospects of 2C. It was so far out of our reach. The notion that we could keep the rise below 1.5C seemed delusional. And yet the target made it into the final agreement. Mostly as an aspiration, but it was in there nonetheless. The world pledged to “limit global warming to ‘well below’ 2C above pre-industrial levels and also, if possible, ‘pursue’ efforts to cap warming at 1.5C”. My perspective on 1.5C hasn’t shifted much since then. Without a major, unexpected technological breakthrough, we will go past this target. Nearly all the climate scientists I know agree: they obviously want to cap warming at 1.5C, but very few think it will happen. This doesn’t stop them fighting for it, though; they know that every 0.1C matters, and is worth working for. But my perspective on 2C has changed. I’m now cautiously optimistic that we can get close to it. It’s more likely than not that we will pass 2C, but perhaps not by much. And there is still a reasonable chance – if we really step up to the challenge – that we can stay below it. My perspective flipped quickly after studying the data, not newspaper headlines. I didn’t focus on where we are today, but on the pace that things have moved at in the past few years, and what this means for the future. One organisation – the Climate Action Tracker – follows every country’s climate policies, and its pledges and targets. It combines them all to map out what will happen to the global climate. At Our World in Data, I sketch out these future climate trajectories and update them every year. Every time, they get closer and closer to the pathways we would need to follow to stay below 2C. If we stick with the climate policies that countries currently have in place, we’re heading towards a world of 2.5C to 2.9C warming. Let me be clear: this is terrible and we have to avoid it. But countries have pledged to go much further. They’ve committed to making their policies much more ambitious. If each country was to follow through on their climate pledges, we’d come out at 2.1C by 2100. What’s most promising is how these pathways have shifted over time. In a world without climate policies, we’d be heading towards 4C or 5C, at least. This is the path that most people still think we’re on. That would be a scary world indeed. Thankfully, over time, countries have stepped up their commitments. As we saw with the example of the ozone layer, incremental increases in ambition can make a huge difference. View image in fullscreen Ritchie’s perspective ‘flipped after studying the data, not newspaper headlines’. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Observer The other big change is that moving to a low-carbon, sustainable economy is not seen as the sacrifice it used to be. Fossil fuels were far cheaper than renewables. Electric vehicles cost a fortune. But now low-carbon technologies are becoming cost-competitive. It now makes financial sense to take the climate-friendly path. Leaders have become more optimistic about how the landscape is changing. We are still some distance from a 2C pathway. We need to step up our efforts – and quickly. But as it becomes more and more realistic, I’m confident we can keep moving closer to it. W hen I was in my early teens, I thought most of us were going to die from climate change. I tried to convince my classmates of this, too. For my English oral exam, I held up a map of all of the cities and coastlines that were going to sink by the end of the century. I showed projected satellite images of the wildfires that would ravage the globe. In trying to light flames of interest, I simply added fire to my own anxieties. By the time I reached Edinburgh University, I was being flooded with images every day. Some from my university lectures, which, given the fact I’d chosen a degree in earth sciences, was expected. But, more importantly, my obsession for environmental sciences was growing in tandem with the uptick in the frequency of reporting. The more determined I became to stay informed, the quicker the stories came at me, often accompanied by streams of recorded videos. I didn’t have to imagine the pain of the victims, I could see and hear it, too. As a responsible citizen, I wanted to stay informed. I had to know what the latest disaster was. To switch off from them seemed like a betrayal to the lives that were lost. With reports of disasters coming at me faster every day, it seemed that things must be getting worse. Climate change was driving an intensification of disasters, and more people were dying than ever before. Or so I thought. The problem was that I mistook the increase in the frequency of reporting as an increase in the frequency of disasters. I mistook an increase in the intensity of my secondhand suffering for an increase in the intensity of global suffering. In reality, I had no idea what was happening. Were disasters getting worse? Were there more this year than last? Were there more people dying than ever before? Then I discovered the work of Swedish physician, statistician and public speaker Hans Rosling. Videos of his lectures taught me that extreme poverty and child mortality were falling and education and life expectancy were rising. I went looking for other areas where my preconceptions might be wrong. I started with data on “natural” disasters. I would have bet a lot of money that more people were dying from disasters today than a century ago. I was completely wrong. Death rates from disasters have actually fallen since the first half of the 20th century. And not just by a little bit. They have fallen roughly tenfold. It’s at this point that I should make one thing clear: none of the above means that climate change is not happening. The decline in deaths from disasters does not mean that disasters are getting weaker or less common. Deniers often misuse this data to downplay the existence or risks of climate change. But that’s not what the data shows us at all. In the past, it was common for disasters to claim millions of lives a year. The 1920s, 30s and 40s were particularly bad. There were a few large earthquakes that claimed many lives: China, Japan, Pakistan, Turkey and Italy were all hit by a series of earthquakes that cost tens of thousands of lives. The most lethal – the 1920 earthquake that struck the Gansu province in China – is estimated to have killed 180,000 people. But it was drought and floods that were the most deadly. China endured a number of large floods and droughts through the 1920s and 30s, which often led to widespread famine and killed millions at a time. Today, the annual death toll is much smaller, usually between 10,000 and 20,000. Sometimes, there are particularly devastating years where the toll is much higher – like 2010, when the annual death toll was more than 300,000, with most deaths resulting from the Haitian earthquake. When I zoomed out and saw these trends, I felt stupid. I also felt cheated. I had been duped by an education system that was supposed to teach me about the world. I was a diligent student. I won medals for coming top for everything, from earth materials to sedimentology, atmospheric science to oceanography. I could create complex diagrams of seismic faults, I could recite the chemical formulas of pages of minerals from memory, but if you’d asked me to draw a graph of what was happening to deaths from disasters, I’d have sketched it upside down. I wasn’t alone in my ignorance. In the 2017 Gapminder Misconception Study, the public, across 14 countries, were asked 12 key questions, one of which was: How did the number of deaths per year from natural disasters change over the past 100 years? a) More than doubled b) Remained more or less the same c) Decreased to less than half Just 10% got the right answer: c). The most popular answer, 48% of the vote, was a). T o tackle climate change, we have to accept two things: climate change is happening and human emissions of greenhouse gases are responsible. We simply don’t have time to argue about the existence of climate change. By “we”, I mean all of us, collectively. The time for debating is over. We need to move past it to the question of what we’re going to do about it. Let’s take a close look at where we are with carbon emissions. They are still rising, but the world has already passed the peak of per capita emissions. It happened a decade ago. Most people are unaware of this. In 2012, the world topped out at 4.9 tonnes per person. Since then, per capita emissions have been slowly falling. Nowhere near fast enough, but falling nonetheless. This is a signal that the peak in our total (not per capita) CO 2 emissions is coming. This is the case with any metric in a world with an increasing population. Per capita measures will peak first, then it’s a tug-of-war over whether our impacts per person will fall more quickly than the population is growing. We are very close. Emissions increased rapidly in the 1960s and 70s, then again in the 1990s and early 2000s. But in recent years, this growth has slowed down a lot. Emissions barely increased at all from 2018 to 2019. And they actually fell in 2020 as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic. I’m optimistic we can peak global emissions in the 2020s. One of the simple things that brings me the most joy in life is getting an email from my grandma. My gran is in her mid-80s and can almost work an iPad. By “work”, I mean do the basics of looking at a photograph and sending an email. She doesn’t have an iPhone, a laptop or a smartwatch. My grandpa rejects all modern technology, except television. Their life is very similar to how it was a few decades ago. This has created something of a divide between the generations on climate change. Many see the lifestyles of youngsters as the problem. We spend all day on energy-guzzling gadgets. We flock to dense cities with no gardens or green space. We buy lots of stuff and don’t bother to repair it. We never ration food and waste too much of it. View image in fullscreen Climate activists protest against fossil fuels at Cop28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, 12 December 2023. Photograph: Thomas Mukoya/ Yet my carbon footprint is less than half that of my grandparents’ when they were my age. When my grandparents were in their 20s, the average person in the UK emitted 11 tonnes of CO 2 per year. We now emit less than five tonnes. The gap between me and my parents is equally wide. From the 1950s to the 90s, emissions in the UK changed very little. It’s only since then – in my lifetime – that emissions have plummeted. Technology has made that possible. In 1900, nearly all of the UK’s energy came from coal and, by 1950, it was still supplying more than 90%. Now coal supplies less than 2% of our electricity, and the government has pledged to phase it out completely by 2025. Coal is now almost dead in its birthplace, where it all began. It has been replaced with other sources of energy: gas, then nuclear, and now a transition to wind, solar and other renewable sources. That means that, for every unit of energy we consume, we emit much less CO 2 . But that’s not the only change. We also use much less energy overall. Per capita energy use has fallen by around 25% since the 1960s. Year after year, more efficient gadgets have come into our lives. First, it was improvements in the energy ratings of white goods, then it was the trend of replacing inefficient lightbulbs. Then it was double-glazed windows and home insulation to stop heat leaking out into the street. When I was a kid, our family television – we “only” had one – was a massive box that seemed to be two metres deep. The screen was so small you had to sit really close to see anything. Our car was a gas guzzler. Not a gas guzzler like we see with SUVs today. My parents would never have bought one of those. No, our car was secondhand and it was a “banger”. It was inefficient: you could hear the engine roar and feel it overheating. The miles per gallon were terrible. These massive strides in technology mean that we use much less energy than we did in the past, despite appearing to lead much more extravagant, energy-intensive lifestyles. The notion that we need to be frugal to live a low-carbon life is simply wrong. In the UK, we now emit about the same as someone in the 1850s. I emit the same as my great-great-great-grandparents. And I have a much, much higher standard of living. Yet very few people know that emissions are falling. The climate scientist Jonathan Foley recently polled his followers on Twitter . He asked what had happened to emissions in the US over the past 15 years. Had they: a) Increased by more than 20% b) Increased by 10% c) Stayed the same d) Fallen by 20% Thousands of people answered. Two-thirds of people picked a) or b). Just 19% picked the correct answer d). No wonder people think we’re screwed. We have a habit of underestimating how quickly things can change. Most of us have been too pessimistic about renewable energy in the past, even the experts. Part of the reason I thought that 2C was so far out of reach was that I couldn’t see how low-carbon energy could grow quickly enough. In just a decade between 2009 and 2019, solar photovoltaic and wind energy went from the most to the least expensive source. The price of electricity from solar has declined by 89%, and the price of onshore wind has declined by 70%. They are now cheaper than coal. Leaders no longer have to make the difficult choice between climate action and providing energy for their people. The low-carbon choice has suddenly become the economic one. It’s staggering how quickly this change has happened. Poorer countries do not have to follow the fossil fuel-heavy and unsustainable trajectories that rich countries did. They can leapfrog the centuries-long journey that we’ve taken. And they don’t have to sacrifice human wellbeing or access to energy. In fact, by adopting these technologies they can ensure that even more people have access to affordable energy. The huge progress being made in developing affordable low-carbon alternatives to fossil fuels is just one counter to the doomsday thinking of so much of the climate change conversation. It has become too common to tell kids that they’re going to die from climate change. If a heatwave doesn’t get them, then a wildfire will. Or a hurricane, a flood or mass starvation. There is an intense feeling of anxiety and dread among young people about what the planet has in store for us. In my book, I look at realistic ways we can adapt the fields of energy, transport, food and construction to rein in climate change while improving human wellbeing at the same time. If we take several steps back, we can see something truly radical, gamechanging and life-giving: humanity is in a truly unique position to build a sustainable world. Another reason some climate scientists are less pessimistic is that they believe that things can change. The past few decades have been an uphill battle for them. They’ve been mostly ignored. Often they were the ones framed as apocalyptic scaremongers. But, finally, the world has woken up to the reality of climate change and people are taking action. The climate scientists know change is possible because they’ve seen it happen. Against the odds, they’ve driven much of it."""
"""China's reliance on coal reduces life expectancy by 5.5 years, says study | Pollution |  Skip to main content Skip to navigation Skip to navigation Heavy smog shrouds Beijing with pollution at hazardous levels. Photograph: Feng Li/Getty Images Heavy smog shrouds Beijing with pollution at hazardous levels. Photograph: Feng Li/Getty Images This article is more than 11 years old China's reliance on coal reduces life expectancy by 5.5 years, says study This article is more than 11 years old High levels of air pollution will cause 500 million people to lose an aggregate 2.5 billion years from their lives Air pollution causes people in northern China to live an average of 5.5 years shorter than their southern counterparts, according to a study released on Monday which claims to show in unprecedented detail the link between air pollution and life expectancy. High levels of air pollution in northern China – much of it caused by an over-reliance on burning coal for heat – will cause 500 million people to lose an aggregate 2.5 billion years from their lives, the authors predict in the study, published in the journal the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. The geographic disparity can be traced back to China's Huai River policy which, since it was implemented between 1950 and 1980, has granted free wintertime heating to people living north of the Huai river, a widely-acknowledged dividing line between northern and southern China. Much of that heating comes from the combustion of coal, significantly impacting the region's air quality. ""Using data covering an unusually long timespan – from 1981 through 2000 – the researchers found that air pollution … was about 55% higher north of the river than south of it,"" the MIT Energy Initiative said in a statement . ""Linking the Chinese pollution data to mortality statistics from 1991 to 2000, the researchers found a sharp difference in mortality rates on either side of the border formed by the Huai River. They also found the variation to be attributable to cardiorespiratory illness, and not to other causes of death."" The researchers, based in Israel, Beijing, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, gauged the region's air quality according to the established metric of ""total suspended particulates (TSP) ,"" representing the concentration of certain airborne particles per cubic meter of air. The study concluded that long-term exposure to air containing 100 micrograms of TSP per cubic meter ""is associated with a reduction in life expectancy at birth of about 3.0 years."" Air pollution has been the subject of widespread public outrage in China since January , when Beijing's air quality index (AQI) – a similar metric to TSP – regularly exceeded 500, the scale's maximum reading, for weeks on end. On 12 January, Beijing's AQI hit a record 755 , 30 times higher than levels deemed safe by the World Health Organisation. Past studies have established a link between air pollution and reduced life expectancy. One recent large-scale study concluded that air pollution contributed to 1.2 million premature deaths in China in 2010. Yet according to Michael Greenstone, an economics professor at MIT and one of the study's authors, this study is the first to precisely quantify their relationship. ""Demonstrating that people die a bit earlier  is interesting and helps establish that pollution is bad,"" he said. ""But the most important question, the next question that needed to be answered, is what's the loss of life expectancy? How much should society be willing to pay to avoid high levels of pollution? This study was structured so we could answer that question."" China's central authorities are keenly aware that environmental degradation has become one of the country's leading causes of social unrest. Last month, China's cabinet revealed 10 new measures intended to combat air pollution , and state media reported that Chinese courts can now impose the death penalty on serious polluters. """

Cold kills more people than heat in Europe, and some have argued that climate change will benefit society by reducing those deaths. But the study , published in the Lancet Public Health, found that the death toll would respond slowly to warming weather and may even rise through people growing older and more vulnerable to dangerous temperatures. If global heating reaches a catastrophic 3C or 4C, the researchers concluded, the rise in heat deaths will greatly outstrip the fall in cold deaths. The researchers said the results suggested climate change could pose “unprecedented challenges” to public health systems, particularly during heatwaves. “Many more heat-related deaths are expected to occur as the climate warms and populations age, while deaths from cold decline only slightly,” said David García-León from the Joint Research Centre at the European Commission, a co-author of the study. Deaths from warm weather could kill 129,000 people a year if temperatures rise to 3C above preindustrial levels. Today, heat-related deaths in Europe stand at 44,000. But the yearly death toll from cold and heat in Europe may rise from 407,000 people today to 450,000 in 2100 even if world leaders meet their global warming target of 1.5C, the study found. Warming climate is turning rivers rusty with toxic metals Read more The research comes on the back of a series of scorching heatwaves that have wreaked havoc across the continent. Its results challenge arguments from climate deniers that global heating is good for society because fewer people will die from cold. Even in Europe, the coolest inhabited continent, the lives lost to stronger heat will offset those saved by milder cold, the study found. Countries across Asia, Africa, Oceania and the Americas are baking in even deadlier temperatures. “This research is a stark reminder of the number of lives that we are putting at risk if we fail to act quickly enough against climate change,” said Madeleine Thomson, the head of climate impacts and adaptation at the health research charity Wellcome, who was not involved in the study. The predicted tripling of direct heat deaths in Europe was “not even the full picture,” she added, pointing to research that links extreme heat to miscarriages and worse mental health. “And then there are the indirect impacts. We have already seen how extreme heat events can cause crop failure, wildfire devastation, damage critical infrastructure and hit the economy – all of which will have knock-on effects on our lives.” The researchers modelled data on 854 cities to estimate deaths from hot and cold temperatures across the continent. They found that heat would kill more people in all parts of Europe but that the heaviest burden would fall on southern European countries such as Spain, Italy and Greece, as well as parts of France. They projected the death toll from uncomfortable temperatures would rise by 13.5% if the planet heats 3C – a level of climate breakdown slightly higher than policies are expected to cause – leading to 55,000 extra deaths. Most of those who die will be older than 85. Gary Konstantinoudis, an epidemiologist from the MRC Centre for Environment and Health , who was not involved in the research, said the study was of high quality and provided valuable insights, but cautioned that predicting temperature-related deaths was complex and would always contain uncertainty. skip past newsletter promotion after newsletter promotion The analysis was based on a previous study that assumed the effect of temperature on death rates was constant between 2000 and 2019, he said, but other studies have reported a decrease because of factors such as improved healthcare and changes to infrastructure. “Not accounting for this is expected to overestimate the future impact of heat on mortality,” he said. The study also extrapolated heat mortality data from cities to rural regions, which face less heat stress. Elisa Gallo, an environmental epidemiologist at ISGlobal who has studied heat mortality in Europe , and who was not involved in the study, said it was “increasingly essential” to adapt to rising heat. The researchers encouraged governments to consider policies to reduce death tolls, such as investing in hospitals, creating action plans and insulating buildings. They highlighted that the projected rise in deaths was driven by changes to Europe’s population structure and climate. “If we want to avoid reaching the worst-case scenario, it is fundamental to tackle the root of the problem by addressing emissions of greenhouse gases,” said Gallo. The researchers concluded that efforts to adapt should focus on regions with high unemployment, poverty, structural economic changes, emigration and ageing populations. They said such areas were less able to adapt to climate damages and also hit harder by the rise in heat deaths."""
""" Climate change exposes future generations to life-long health harm. LONDON (Reuters) - A child born today faces multiple and life-long health harms from climate change - growing up in a warmer world with risks of food shortages, infectious diseases, floods and extreme heat, a major global study has found. Climate change is already harming people's health by increasing the number of extreme weather events and exacerbating air pollution, according to the study published in The Lancet medical journal. And if nothing is done to mitigate it, its impacts could burden an entire generation with disease and illness throughout their lives. ""Children are particularly vulnerable to the health risks of a changing climate. Their bodies and immune systems are still developing, leaving them more susceptible to disease and environmental pollutants,"" said Nick Watts, who co-led The Lancet Countdown on Health and Climate Change study. He warned that health damage in early childhood is ""persistent and pervasive"", and carries lifelong consequences. ""Without immediate action from all countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, gains in wellbeing and life expectancy will be compromised, and climate change will come to define the health of an entire generation,"" he told a London briefing. Yet introducing policies to limit emissions and cap global warming would see a different outcome, the research teams said. In that scenario, a child born today, would see an end to coal use in Britain, for example, by their 6th birthday, and the world reaching net-zero emissions by the time they were 31. The Lancet study is a collaboration by 120 experts from 35 institutions including the World Health Organization, the World Bank, University College London and China's Tsinghua University. On a ""business-as-usual"" pathway, with little action to limit climate change, it found that amid rising temperatures and extreme weather events, children would be vulnerable to malnutrition and rising food prices, and the most likely to suffer from warmer waters and climates accelerating the spread of infectious diseases such as dengue fever and cholera. Among the most immediate and long-lasting health threats from climate change is air pollution, the researchers said. They called for urgent action to reduce outdoor and indoor pollution through the introduction of cleaner fuels and vehicles, and policies to encourage safe and active transport such as walking and cycling. The WHO says that globally in 2016, 7 million deaths were due to the effects of household and ambient air pollution. The vast majority of these were in low and middle-income countries. ""If we want to protect our children, we need to make sure the air they breathe isn't toxic,"" said Sonja Ayeb-Karlsson, a global health specialist at Britain's Sussex University who worked on the Lancet study.

"""Air pollution now a major risk to life expectancy in South Asia - study. NEW DELHI, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Rising air pollution can cut life expectancy by more than five years per person in South Asia, one of the world's most polluted regions, according to a report published on Tuesday which flagged the growing burden of hazardous air on health.
The region, which includes the world's most polluted countries of Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan, accounts for more than half of the total life years lost globally to pollution, the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) said in its latest Air Quality Life Index. Rapid industrialization and population growth have contributed to declining air quality in South Asia, where particulate pollution levels are currently more than 50% higher than at the start of the century and now overshadow dangers posed by larger health threats.
People in Bangladesh, the world's most polluted country, stands to lose 6.8 years of life on average per person, compared to 3.6 months in the United States, according to the study, which uses satellite data to calculate the impact of an increase in airborne fine particles on life expectancy.
India is responsible for about 59% of the world's increase in pollution since 2013, the report said, as hazardous air threatens to shorten lives further in some of the country's more polluted regions. In the densely populated New Delhi, the world's most polluted mega-city, the average life span is down by more than 10 years. Reducing global levels of lung-damaging airborne particles, known as PM 2.5, to levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) could raise average life expectancy by 2.3 years, or a combined 17.8 billion life years, the report said.
An average resident of Pakistan would gain 3.9 years from meeting the WHO guidelines of limiting average annual PM 2.5 concentration to 5 micrograms per cubic meter, while someone in Nepal would live 4.6 years longer if the guideline was met, according to the report.
China, meanwhile, has worked to reduce pollution by 42.3% between 2013 and 2021, the report said, highlighting the need for governments to generate accessible air quality data to help bridge global inequalities in accessing tools to combat pollution. """
"""Asia, Africa bear brunt of pollution health burden - research. SINGAPORE, Aug 29 (Reuters) - Despite improvements in China, air pollution across the globe continues to pose the greatest external risk to human health, with countries in Asia and Africa suffering most of the impact, new research showed on Tuesday.
Around three quarters of the adverse health effects of air pollution is concentrated in just six countries - Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, China, Nigeria and Indonesia, the University of Chicago's Energy Policy Institute (EPIC) said in its annual Air Quality Life Index (AQLI) report. If hazardous airborne particles known as PM2.5 were brought down to levels recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO), average life expectancy would rise by 2.3 years worldwide, saving a combined 17.8 billion life years, the report estimated.
While average world pollution levels have fallen slightly over the past decade, almost all of the improvement has been driven by China, where a 10-year ""war on pollution"" has seen PM2.5 fall by more than 40% since 2013.
""While China has had remarkable success in its war against air pollution, the trend in other parts of the world is going in the opposite direction,"" said Christa Hasenkopf, AQLI's director. PM2.5 in South Asia has risen by nearly 10% since 2013, she said, cutting average life expectancy in the region by around five years. Growing energy consumption in central and western Africa was also turning particulate pollution into a growing health threat on par with HIV/AIDS and malaria.
Virtually all of Southeast Asia is also now considered to have ""unsafe levels of pollution"", with average life expectancy cut by 2-3 years.
China's average PM2.5 concentrations stood at 29 micrograms per cubic metre in 2022, but it still remains significantly higher than the WHO recommendation of 5 micrograms.
While improvements in China have helped raise average life expectancy by 2.2 years since 2013, it could rise by another 2.5 years if the country were to meet the WHO standard.
""We haven't turned the corner on air pollution yet, though China's example shows us that the issue is a tractable one,"" Hasenkopf said."""

Switzerland-based air quality monitoring database IQAir unveiled its findings on Tuesday, which draw on data from 40,000 air quality monitoring stations in 138 countries, finding that Chad, Bangladesh, Pakistan, India and the Democratic Republic of the Congo have the most polluted air in the world.

Data gap The scale of the problem might be far greater than reported, given that many parts of the world lack the monitoring needed for more accurate data. Across Africa, for example, there is only one monitoring station for every 3.7 million people. The data gap could grow wider following an announcement by the US Department of State last week that it will no longer make public the data it gathers from its embassies and consulates around the world. Advertisement Many developing countries have relied on air quality sensors mounted on US embassy and consulate buildings to track their smog levels, but the US State Department is now ending the monitoring scheme, citing budget constraints. “Most countries have a few other data sources, but it’s going to impact Africa significantly, because oftentimes these are the only sources of publicly available real-time air quality monitoring data,” said Christi Chester-Schroeder, IQAir’s air quality science manager. Christa Hasenkopf, director of the Clean Air Program at the University of Chicago’s Energy Policy Institute (EPIC), said at least 34 countries will lose access to reliable pollution data after the US programme closes. The State Department scheme improved air quality in the cities where the monitors were placed, boosting life expectancy and even reducing hazard allowances for US diplomats, meaning that it paid for itself, Hasenkopf said. As a result of the State Department’s move, more than 17 years of data were removed last week from the US government’s official air quality monitoring site, airnow.gov, including readings collected in Chad. According to the report, Chad and Bangladesh had average smog levels more than 15 times higher than WHO guidelines last year. Chad was ranked the most polluted country in 2022 due to Sahara dust as well as uncontrolled crop burning. Climate change is playing an increasing role in driving up pollution, Chester-Schroeder warned, with higher temperatures causing fiercer and lengthier forest fires that have swept through parts of Southeast Asia and South America."""

But as we plunder its resources and emit pollutants into the atmosphere, we are not only killing the wildlife and plants, we share the earth with, we are directly harming our own health. Attempts to secure more energy, food and infrastructure leave a trail of environmental contamination and human health hazards. It is no secret that humans are inherently selfish creatures; the warning signs of climate change have been present for decades, but it is only since seeing the direct effects it has had on our safety and wellbeing that most of us have been spurred into action. Advertisement One of the main items on the COP26 agenda is aiming for a global reduction in fossil fuel burning. Fossil fuels are formed from the fossilised remains of dead plants and animals that humans extract and burn for their carbon-containing energy content. They include coal, crude oil and natural gas. Burning fossil fuels has been shown to have direct adverse effects on our health. Air pollution continues to be a serious public health concern affecting nine out of 10 individuals living in urban areas worldwide. Exposure to air pollution is the ninth biggest risk factor for lung and heart damage. Burning coal is a leading cause of greenhouse gas emissions as well as an array of toxic chemicals. China, India and the United States are the world’s main coal mining regions. However, Indonesia, Australia, Russia, South Africa and Colombia also produce large amounts. Coal-burning not only releases carbon dioxide and methane, two of the worst greenhouse gases, but also sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and mercury – all of which are harmful to human health. Crude oil combustion also releases harmful gases such as carbon dioxide and sulphur into the atmosphere, whereas burning natural gas can release the powerful greenhouse gas methane when it is heated and compressed to release energy into the air. The lungs are the primary organ affected by gases and chemicals released by fossil fuel burning. People who work in coal mines are far more likely to suffer from lung diseases like emphysema and bronchitis; both conditions obstruct airways and make it difficult to breathe. Those who live near coal stations and breathe in air that contains the harmful components that coal-burning releases are also at higher risk of suffering from these conditions. It is time for change; we must demand better from our leaders and no longer sleepwalk alongside them into climate catastrophe. Nitrogen oxide , in particular, can affect the protein component in the lungs and reduce their ability to inflate and deflate as well as they should, meaning airflow is reduced, leaving people with chronic lung conditions that can leave them short of breath. Inhalation of these same chemicals has also been shown to have an adverse effect on the heart muscle in some people, causing it to become bigger and weaker, a condition known as cardiac muscle hypertrophy. Advertisement It stands to reason that if these harmful chemicals can affect adults in such ways, children must also be at increased risk. Studies have shown that children exposed to higher levels of carbon in the air have an increased risk of cognitive impairment and even memory issues. There is also evidence showing that an association between high levels of nitrogen oxide and pollution from traffic on roads can affect fertility as well as the menstrual cycle in some women and increase the risk of miscarriage during pregnancy. And it is not just women being affected; there has been a steady decline in overall sperm count in men over the last 50 years, with poor air quality thought to play a factor. Air pollution has also been linked to lower birthweights in newborn babies as well as an increased risk of premature delivery, which in itself carries a high risk of health complications for babies. Health authorities and governments have been aware of the evidence linking adverse health outcomes to poor air quality, but many have been slow to act, putting profit and the drive for a growing economy over the health of their populations. It is time for change; we must demand better from our leaders and no longer sleepwalk alongside them into climate catastrophe. We are constantly being told that the current infrastructures are too complex to change, that it would cost too much. But what is the cost of doing nothing? Surely there is no price too high to pay for the future of our planet and the health of our children. Advertisement We need firm answers and pledges from COP26, no more excuses. Our lives depend on it. Progress report: What is the AY.4.2 coronavirus subvariant? Many of us are now used to hearing about new variants of the coronavirus. The Delta variant has become dominant due to mutations on its spike protein that allow it to more quickly and effectively bind to human host cells, making it more infectious than previous variants.  Now a new subvariant of the Delta variant has been identified. Known as AY.4.2, it was first identified in the United Kingdom in July and has now spread to at least 42 countries, including the United States, according to the latest World Health Organization (WHO) weekly epidemiological update on COVID-19. The AY.4.2 subvariant is known to contain two additional mutations on its spike protein, which is the part of the virus that sticks out and allows it to bind to human host cells thereby infecting them. The mutations – Y145H and A222V – are currently under investigation by scientists. The questions they will be asking are whether the mutations make this new subvariant more transmissible, more dangerous and more evasive to the immune response triggered by the vaccines. The AY.4.2. subvariant has only been increasing at a modest rate in the UK, making up approximately 6 percent of new COVID cases during the week commencing October 20. It has officially been designated a Variant Under Investigation by the UK Health Security Agency. So far, there is little evidence that we need to be overly concerned about this new subvariant; it has yet to show itself as being more infectious than the original Delta variant and there is nothing to suggest it will take over its parent as the dominant variant of the coronavirus. There is also no real evidence of it causing a severer illness or being any more evasive to the immune reaction stimulated by the vaccines. Advertisement The advice around protecting ourselves from COVID remains the same: get vaccinated when offered, keep indoor spaces ventilated, wear a mask in crowded spaces and maintain good hand hygiene. Good news: US approves vaccines for 5 to 11-year-olds On October 29, 2021, the US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA ) released a statement approving the emergency use of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine to include children aged five to 11 years old. An Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) is a mechanism to facilitate the availability and use of medical countermeasures – including vaccines – during public health emergencies, such as the current COVID pandemic. The decision came after a panel reviewed the data from a study looking at the effectiveness and safety of a low dose version of the Pfizer vaccine in this age group; the panel came to the conclusion ( PDF ) that the benefits of getting the vaccine outweighed any potential risks. In the US, children aged five to 11 make up 39 percent of COVID cases in under-18s. The ongoing study, conducted with approximately 3,100 children in the US, Finland, Poland and Spain, showed that five- to 11-year-olds had a similar immune response to the vaccine as those aged 16 to 25, and that the vaccine was 90.7 percent effective in preventing COVID-19 in this younger age group. While no serious side effects have been detected, commonly reported side effects in the clinical trial included injection site pain (sore arm), redness and swelling, fatigue, headache, muscle and/or joint pain, chills, fever, swollen lymph nodes, nausea and decreased appetite. More children reported side effects after the second dose than after the first. These were generally mild to moderate in severity and occurred within two days of the vaccination. Most went away within one to two days. Advertisement The Pfizer vaccine has been linked to inflammation of the heart muscle and its lining in young men, but the study showed no such side effect in five- to 11-year-olds, although the study was relatively small and is ongoing. Although COVID is generally not as serious a condition in children as it is in adults, there have been 440 deaths of children and teens aged five to 18 from the virus in the US since the start of the pandemic. This may seem like a relatively small number but it is worth pointing out that we do not see high numbers of deaths in this age group in developed countries from any infectious disease. In the US, children aged five to 11 make up 39 percent of COVID cases in those below 18. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), approximately 8,300 COVID-19 cases in children aged five to 11 resulted in hospitalisation. Combined with the higher risk of infection posed by the Delta variant and the danger of Long COVID in children, the FDA has concluded that vaccinating this age group is in their best interests. Personal account: Should the UK be removing countries from its red list? On the morning of November 1, 2021, the UK officially removed any remaining countries from its “red list”. This meant travellers returning from Ecuador, the Dominican Republic, Colombia, Peru, Panama, Haiti and Venezuela will no longer have to quarantine in hotels. Those arriving – fully vaccinated or below 18 years of age – do not need to complete a predeparture COVID test, a test on the eighth day after arriving, or isolate for 10 days at home.  With COVID cases in the UK so high in comparison to many of our neighbouring countries, we are likely to be exporting more coronavirus than we are importing, but I remain concerned about our lax borders. Advertisement I fully empathise with the hardships the travel industry has had to endure during this pandemic. It has been affected more than most – but speaking as a doctor, I remain concerned about the lack of reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) testing for people returning to the UK. Those who return from trips abroad or visit us here – provided they are fully vaccinated – need only do a lateral flow test on the second day after arrival. This then means they have to self-report the result to a government website. The onus is on the individual to report the correct result; there are no checks in place to see if tests are actually being done or if the result being reported is indeed the true reading. I would like to think that most people will report their results honestly and book a RT-PCR test and isolate should their lateral flow test come back positive, but I know this will not be the case for everyone. My other concern is that the lack of routine RT-PCR testing for people arriving from overseas means we have less of a handle on any new variants that might inadvertently be imported in. We saw what happened when the Delta variant was allowed in through open borders earlier this year. My advice would have been to have kept the Day 2 RT-PCR testing in place rather than replace it with a self-reported lateral flow test. That way we could support the travel industry while keeping a closer eye on what was coming in through our borders. Only time will tell if the UK government’s current policy is the correct one. Advertisement Reader’s question: What is the Valneva COVID vaccine? The Valneva vaccine, made by French company Valneva, is a proposed COVID-19 vaccine that is yet to complete trials. The vaccine technology is more traditional in that it uses a similar technique to polio and flu vaccines, relying on an inactivated whole version of the coronavirus, which cannot replicate or cause disease. After being inactivated, the virus is purified and combined with an adjuvant that helps stimulate an immune response.  The reason why there is such interest in this vaccine is that instead of just relying on the spike protein part of the virus – as the Pfizer, Moderna and AstraZeneca vaccines do – this one presents the whole virus to the immune system, meaning that, in theory, you get an immune response to the whole virus and not just part of it. This means that if a part of the actual coronavirus mutates in the future – as we have seen with emerging variants – your immune system will still recognise the unmutated parts and neutralise it. The hope is that vaccines using this technology will be able to provide protection for longer, rather than needing to be reformulated to get ahead of new variants. The results from trials so far have been promising, with good immune responses reported as well as no serious adverse effects. Phase three trials are ongoing, but the UK has already ordered 100 million doses and countries like Australia have also expressed an interest. If we have a vaccine that gets us ahead of any future variants that may emerge, it will indeed be a game-changer. """
"""The Impact of Climate Change on Health and Life Expectancy Climate Change Future CRISIS - Viability of Life on Earth Establishing the Link: Climate Change and Decreasing Life Expectancy by Piers Burnfield-Wiebe Global Commons May 2nd 2024 4 mins Earth.Org is powered by over 150 contributing writers Climate change poses an urgent threat to global public health, amplifying existing humanitarian crises and significantly affecting human well-being. Urgent action is imperative to mitigate the health consequences of climate change, including reducing carbon emissions, strengthening health systems, and promoting health equity. Failure to act swiftly will lead to further loss of life and hinder progress in global health and development. — Climate and Health According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters, ranging from heatwaves to extreme weather events, are increasing, resulting in higher mortality rates and the spread of diseases . A 2024 study published in PLOS Climate highlights the link between rising temperatures and reduced life expectancy. The study reveals that for every degree Celsius increase in temperature, life expectancy declines, on average, by approximately 0.44 years. This underscores the significant health risks associated with global warming, with vulnerable populations, particularly marginalized and low-income communities, and those with limited access to healthcare, bearing the brunt of these impacts. Furthermore, the study challenges the notion that economic development can mitigate the health impacts of climate change, suggesting that climate variables affect health outcomes independently of economic growth.

BECOME A MEMBER Extreme Temperatures and Pollution Impact Human Health A 2023 study highlights the alarming correlation between extreme temperatures and over half a million stroke deaths annually, a trend that has been globally increasing since 1990. Vulnerability to these temperature-related strokes is found to be higher in countries with a lower Socio-Demographic Index (SDI) . The study identifies Western Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Southeast Asia, North Africa and the Middle East as regions experiencing the most significant impact from high temperature-related strokes, with projected rises in stroke deaths linked to climate change-induced temperature increases. The severity of this health crisis is further exacerbated by existing environmental challenges, particularly air pollution. A recent report sheds light on the impact of air pollution on life expectancy in South Asia , which is home to four of the five most polluted countries globally. Residents in Bangladesh, India, Nepal, and Pakistan face an average loss of five years of life due to air pollution, with particulate pollution increasing by 9.7% from 2013 to 2021. This rise correlates with an additional six months’ reduction in life expectancy for inhabitants of the region. Addressing these interconnected health challenges requires urgent global action and multi-level interventions to reduce emissions and improve air quality. You might also like: 10 Facts About Air Pollution You Should Know About The Intersection of Economic Growth and Public Health A collaborative paper between US universities and the National Bureau of Economic Research published in 2016 found evidence from 200 years of data that challenges the conventional notion of economic growth as a marker of progress. The paper highlights the adverse effects of economic growth on public health and underscores the need to prioritize public health in economic policymaking. The study indicates increased mortality rates during economic upswings due to heightened pollution levels associated with industrial activity. Children, especially vulnerable, are disproportionately affected by environmental degradation. Managing the adverse health effects of economic growth is crucial, with countries with robust social safety nets better equipped to mitigate health risks associated with economic fluctuations. Addressing inequality is also paramount, as marginalized populations often bear the brunt of the negative health impacts of economic growth. Where Do We Go From Here? Despite the daunting challenges posed by climate change, there is cause for optimism. The international community is increasingly recognizing the limitations of economic growth as a sole measure of progress and prosperity. Initiatives such as the May 2023 UN Secretary-General’s policy brief advocate for comprehensive wealth metrics that consider economic, social, and environmental well-being (find here a comprehensive summary by the IISD ). This paradigm shift in policy-making prioritizes human well-being and planetary sustainability over narrow economic indicators. Organizations like the World Health Organization (WHO) are taking decisive action to address the health impacts of climate change through strategies focusing on emissions reduction, resilient health systems, and health protection. Collaborative efforts, exemplified by partnerships like the Alliance for Transformative Action on Climate and Health (ATACH) , demonstrate a collective commitment to addressing the intersection of climate change and health. Additionally, the global initiative to achieve net-zero emissions offers hope for a sustainable future, with over 140 countries, 9,000 companies, 1,000 cities, 1,000 educational institutions, and 600 financial institutions uniting to reach this goal. Although current commitments may not fully meet the requirements, the increasing awareness and collaboration among governments, businesses, and civil society demonstrate a step towards a more environmentally responsible and equitable future. Conclusion Climate change is a formidable challenge to global public health and necessitates urgent action. Recognizing the interdependence of economic, social, and environmental well-being and prioritizing health equity and sustainability enables the world to comprehend and address climate change more comprehensively and holistically. Through efforts at the international, national, and community levels, we can safeguard human lives and build a healthier, more resilient future for all.

"""How global warming is taking a toll on human life expectancy SustaiNation How global warming is taking a toll on human life expectancy FRIDAY, MAY 03, 2024 Play Loading... Human life expectancy will reduce by an average of 0.44 years with every 1-degree Celsius increase in the global temperature, according to a recent study. The rising temperature would also increase mortality and spread disease, according to reports from the World Health Organization (WHO). The problem of climate change is seriously threatening the health of the global population and extreme weather disasters and associated impacts are becoming more frequent and severe. A recent study by the journal, PLOS Climate, which showed the 0.44 years reduction in life expectancy for every 1-degree Celsius increase in global temperature, highlights the serious health risks associated with global warming, particularly for vulnerable groups and communities living in marginalised areas. In 2023, a study found that there was a correlation between extreme temperatures and deaths from stroke, totalling more than 500,000 people per year globally. This trend has been increasing since 1990. The regions most severely affected include Sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia, South Asia, North Africa and Middle East. Air pollution remains a significant problem in South Asia. People living in Bangladesh, India, Nepal and Pakistan lose an average of five years of life expectancy due to pollution from particulate matter. This has increased by 9.7% between 2013 and 2021, resulting in an additional average reduction of six months in life expectancy. Addressing health issues linked to climate change and pollution requires urgent global action. This includes reducing greenhouse gas emissions, improving air quality, and promoting public health equity. A study from 2016 by universities in the United States, and the National Bureau of Economic Research, Cambridge, Massachusetts revealed the negative impact of economic growth on public health, emphasising the necessity of prioritising public health considerations in economic policy-making. It highlighted increase in mortality rates during periods of economic expansion due to pollution from industrial activities, with children being particularly affected. In managing the health impacts on economic growth, countries with stronger social safety nets are better able to reduce risk. Greater focus must be placed on tackling inequality, the study said. This is because vulnerable populations are more likely to suffer negative health effects from economic expansion. The changing climate is a significant challenge to the health of people worldwide and requires urgent action. Awareness of the interdependence of economic, social, and environmental well-being is crucial. Prioritising health equity and sustainability enables the world to better understand and address climate change comprehensively and collectively, studies have said.

"""A Silent Threat: Impact of Climate Change on Life Expectancy Rate in Nigeria | by Nigeria Health Watch | Medium Open in app  Sign in Write  Sign in A Silent Threat: Impact of Climate Change on Life Expectancy Rate in Nigeria Nigeria Health Watch · Follow 4 min read · May 14, 2024 -- Listen Share Sunday Oko (Lead Writer) Image credit: Nigeria Health Watch ‘The climate crisis is a health crisis, but for too long, health has been a footnote in climate discussions,” Director-General, World Health Organisation (WHO) Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus The recently concluded COP28 UN Climate Conference heralded a significant milestone with the inclusion of a Health Day, where health ministers in 123 countries signed the non-binding COP28 Declaration on Climate and Health . This historic event highlighted the growing recognition of the undeniable link between health and climate change, however it is important to note that the declaration is non-binding, but it does reflect a realisation that collective action is necessary to address the climate impact on health. The Health Day served as a platform for health to take centre stage in climate negotiations, highlighting the critical role of the health sector in driving climate-resilient policies and sustainable development initiatives globally. Image credit: Nigeria Health Watch In Nigeria, climate change is having an increasing influence, with far-reaching consequences for health and well-being. One of the most serious consequences, is the potential impact on life expectancy. Climate and health intersection Recent studies have shed light on the intricate relationship between climate change and health, especially its link to life expectancy rate. According to a study , as little as a 1°C increase in annual average temperature could lead to a 0.44-year drop in life expectancy at birth, while a 0.10 increase in the composite climate change index (temperature and rainfall) could result in a 0.5-year decrease in life expectancy. Nigeria has made significant progress in raising life expectancy, with both men and women’s rates showing a consistent upward increase over time. According to a recent Bureau of Statistics report , women’s life expectancies increased from 56 to 57 years between 2020 and 2022, while men’s went from 54 to 55.1 years. However, experts have warned that these gains could be reversed owing climate shocks like floods, droughts and heatwaves, as well as the role they play in exacerbating disease outbreaks. Image credit: Nigeria Health Watch Another way climate affects life expectancy is its impact on food production . Many agrarian communities continue to experience decreased rainfall which has led to crop failures and food shortages. This has resulted in malnutrition and food insecurity , particularly among vulnerable populations, such as people in low-income settings with a disproportionate impact on women, children, and senior citizens. Research conducted in Lagos revealed a significant impact of climate change on food crop production and yield between 1998 and 2018, resulting in a notable decline in overall production levels. Increased temperature also creates a conducive environment for the proliferation of disease vectors such as mosquitoes, increasing the incidence of preventable vector-borne diseases like malaria and dengue fever. Similarly, changes in rainfall pattern which refers to the amount of rainfall and its frequency, and intensity, over the years can contribute to the spread of waterborne diseases such as cholera and typhoid. Communities with limited access to healthcare and sanitation bear the biggest brunt as it further widens health disparities. Image credit: Nigeria Health Watch A call for urgent action. According to the World Bank, climate change could result in a loss of between 6% to 30% in Nigeria’s GDP by 2050. This may severely impede human development, including the improvement of the life expectancy rate. Nigeria, like many other countries, must prioritise the implementation of climate adaptation and mitigation to safeguard public health. Government actors and other stakeholders may also establish early detection systems for disease outbreaks caused by climate shocks by launching climate education and disease prevention initiatives aimed at local communities. Enhancing access to primary healthcare services even during floods and prioritising investment in the healthcare workforce’s resilience can be a way to limit the climate’s impact on life expectancy. Strengthening health workers’ capacity is also essential to protect the population from the detrimental effects of climate shocks. Addressing the impacts of climate change on health and life expectancy in Nigeria requires urgent and coordinated action at all levels. It is essential to implement policies and strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, promote sustainable development practices, and build resilience to climate-related events.

"""Life expectancy in the Netherlands will hit 86.5 years by 2050, up from 81 in 2022 | NL Times Skip to main content Image Selective view of four elderly people sitting at a table and building a puzzle - Credit: Wavebreakmedia / DepositPhotos - License: DepositPhotos Health RIVM public health aging population Climate change informal care healthcare young people mental health overweight obesity Public Health Future Exploration » More tags « Less tags Wednesday, 27 November 2024 - 10:20 Share this: facebook twitter linkedin whatsapp reddit Life expectancy in the Netherlands will hit 86.5 years by 2050, up from 81 in 2022 The average life expectancy in the Netherlands will be 86.5 years in 2050, almost 5 years higher than in 2022, the RIVM said in its new Public Health Future Exploration. The aging population continues to put an increasing burden on healthcare. Climate change will also have a greater impact on people’s health, and health differences will not decrease in the coming years. The RIVM urged the government to be consistent with its healthcare policy and also consider how policy in other areas, like education, work, and housing, impacts people’s health. “The demand for care will continue to grow in the coming decades. This requires sharp choices in healthcare,” The RIVM said. With more people growing old healthily, the Netherlands needs to make an effort to ensure that elderly people can continue to participate in society. This is important for vitality and health, the RIVM said. “At the same time, the number of elderly people with health problems like dementia is increasing rapidly , as is the number of people with chronic illnesses ,” the RIVM said. That means an increasing demand for care, that cannot always be provided due to also increasing staff shortages. The aging population combined with healthcare staff shortages will also put more pressure on informal carers. “The number of people aged 75 and over who require informal care will more than double to 650,000 between 2022 and 2050, but the increase in informal carers will lag far behind.” The RIVM also noticed that young people have an increasingly unhealthy lifestyle. Obesity will increase significantly in the coming years, and increasingly start at a younger age. More and more young people are also struggling with their mental health . The health institute stressed that it is important to invest in young people’s health. “For example by limiting the number of sales outlets and advertisements for unhealthy food and by paying attention to reducing performance pressure.” “Another important development is the impact of climate change on the living environment and health,” the RIVM said. In the coming years, more people will suffer from heat stress, the risk of infectious diseases spreading is increasing, there will be more skin cancer, and more people will die from the heat. Climate change can also cause more mental stress. “To counteract these consequences, a healthy design of the living environment is important. This can be done, for example, by providing more greenery in cities .” All in all, the health differences in the Netherlands are not decreasing in the coming years, the RIVM said. “This means that people with a worse social position live in good health on average 14 years less than groups that are better off,” the public health and environment institute said. Poverty, uncertain income, poor housing conditions, and a lack of social networks contribute to this. There are many public health challenges for the government to tackle in the coming years. The RIVM recommends a “steadfast, clear, and concrete policy,” pointing out that prevention is a matter of years and decades. “The effects of measures against, for example, an unhealthy lifestyle will only be visible years later.” The RIVM advised the government to set clear health goals in its policy and realize that many tasks are interrelated. “It is necessary to tackle them together, with public health as the central focus,” the institute said. “It is also important that, in addition to new measures, the health policy that is already in place, such as anti-smoking policy or policy that encourages exercise, is continued.” More like this Image Netherlands will see 18 cancer diagnoses per hour by 2032 Image Nearly two-thirds of Dutch will be overweight by 2050: RIMV Image Netherlands will have 12 million chronically ill residents by 2050."""
"""Air pollution has a more devastating effect on life expectancy than smoking and war. Combined with the effects of climate change, dirty air could be the next biggest threat to our respiratory health.  Air pollution is a bigger killer than HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria combined, according to a recent report from the Air Quality Life Index (AQLI). Particulate pollution has a more devastating impact on life expectancy than smoking or even war, the scientists say. It is cutting short the lives of billions of people, with the average global citizen losing 2.2 years of their life to today’s air pollution levels. If nothing changes then that will add up to 17 billion years of life lost around the world. The problem is being made worse by the climate crisis, with high temperatures leading to wildfires that increase air pollution. This creates a dangerous cycle, the researchers say. Fossil fuel burning - in particular coal - is feeding the problem. Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human health on the planet. “Air pollution is the greatest external threat to human health on the planet,"" says Professor Micheal Greenstone, one of the scientists who created the AQLI, “and that is not widely recognised, or not recognised with the force and vigour that one might expect.” Though the scientists say that lockdowns have proven we can reduce pollution and a different future is possible, it all depends on whether governments choose to act. Mums for Lungs In the UK, air pollution is thought to be responsible for up to 36,000 deaths every year and some studies say it could be higher. Ruth is one person who has seen the impact of this firsthand. “My son first started having breathing difficulties in the heatwave of 2018,” she says. “If you remember that one, it was around 34 degrees (Celsius), some days cooler, for about two and a half months in London and the air quality was really bad.” Ruth says that by November, her son had seven asthma attacks and they were on their third visit to the hospital. It was then that a paediatric respiratory specialist told her air pollution could be part of the problem. He said that they should avoid walking along busy streets, main roads and next to traffic.

Unlike plastic pollution, where images of a beach covered in waste paint a direct picture of the consequences, the effects on our respiratory health aren’t so visually clear. “I think because we can't see air pollution that maybe makes it slightly harder to communicate.” “It's very much an issue that is also outside of London and that kind of that surprised me as well when I was first looking into it.” Though she lives in London, after looking at air quality maps Ruth says she found that levels of PM2.5 and PM10 were high in towns and cities across the UK. It’s not something that can easily be escaped. Related The death of Ella Adoo-Kissi-Debrah: Why are black people more likely to be exposed to toxic air? Europe will miss its 2030 climate goal by 21 years at current pace Is air pollution the only issue? It isn’t just air pollution threatening our health but a whole host of other impacts of climate change that could be putting our lungs in danger - many of which we are surprisingly unaware of. ADVERTISEMENT As we emerge from the effects of COVID-19, climate change could be the next biggest threat to our respiratory health according to a new report from the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU). The EIU identified five major ways that climate change is damaging our respiratory health: Higher temperatures can increase ozone levels and how often and how severe respiratory infections can be. Heatwaves: With every degree of Celsius in temperature increase, it is thought that the risk of premature death for respiratory patients is six times that of the general population. The amount of pollen in the air: Rising temperatures and carbon dioxide levels are increasing pollen load by expanding the area where plants can grow and extending their season. How allergic we are to pollen: As well as increasing the amount of pollen in the air, storms can cause pollen grains to burst, allowing them to get deeper into our lungs and cause health issues. Extreme weather events: Dust storms carry pollen, viruses and fungal spores, particulates from wildfires can travel up to 1,000km and thunderstorms cause pollen levels to rise and lead to asthma epidemics. Smoke covers Athens centre, due to fires burning at the foot of Mount Parnes, 30 kilometres north of Athens. LOUISA GOULIAMAKI/AFP Tom Delahoyde is the managing director of Chiesi UK who commissioned the report and he says it was done on behalf of patients suffering the health consequences of climate change, “right here, right now”. Climate change is disproportionately affecting the economically disadvantaged and those with underlying health conditions, such as asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are most at risk. ADVERTISEMENT “One of the key findings in this report is that respiratory health issues are actually exacerbated by the climate crisis, which is putting vulnerable people at risk, and actually worsening inequality within our society,” he says. “Heatwave related issues particularly impact the elderly, so the 65 and above age groups, but also infants, where children’s lungs are still developing, can be impacted by this.” Related Extreme weather disasters are happening five times more often because of climate change ‘Most toxic air in the UK’: Why is this London neighbourhood covered in dust? What can be done to prevent this health crisis? Ruth is a member of Mums for Lungs, a group campaigning for everyone to have clean air as soon as possible. They want to see elected officials tackle the problem of air pollution through actions such as expanding the Ultra Low Emission Zone (ULEZ) in London, commitment to WHO clean air guidelines as part of the Environment Bill and a reduction in car ownership. ADVERTISEMENT “I think there's a sense of urgency about it as well because children grow up quickly,” she adds. “When there are targets being set, you know, we want to get all diesel cars off the road by 2030, I think ‘that’s 10 years’. My son is going to be 15, nearly fully grown and then what difference is that going to make to him? Nothing. “We want to make a difference to this generation that's growing up.” Policymakers really need to prioritise respiratory health in the fight against climate change. A lack of action is a problem around the world, not just in Europe. A recent analysis from the Clean Air Fund found that 20 per cent more global aid goes to fossil fuel projects than it does to tackling the air pollution they cause.  Delahoyde says tackling the impacts of the climate crisis on respiratory health has to be a joint effort between policymakers, businesses and health professionals. “Policymakers really need to prioritise respiratory health in the fight against climate change and companies need to take meaningful, measurable and independently verified actions,” he concludes. “Only then can we encourage and track progress towards a greener, healthier society.” Go to accessibility shortcuts Share this article Comments You might also like Green News Now playing Next EU citizens could now claim damages over harmful air pollution levels World News Now playing Next Belgian coast guard plane 'sniffs out' pollution emitted from ships Climate Now playing Next Why are humans still walking towards the climate abyss?

"""European life expectancy increases by 9 months due to less pollution. Europeans have gained an average of nine extra months of life expectancy, thanks to successful air pollution regulations. Since the creation of the European Environment Agency, resulting emissions targets have meant European citizens are now exposed to 41 per cent less particulate pollution than they were two decades ago. This insight was published in the Air Quality of Life Index which takes air pollution concentrations and looks at their impact on life expectancy. Created by the University of Chicago (UoC), the report allows governments to see the results of successful or unsuccessful pollution limiting measures in real terms. Scientists creating the AQLI say that the particulates in polluted air are “working unseen inside the human body” and have a “more devastating impact” on life expectancy worldwide than diseases like HIV/AIDS or risks like cigarette smoking. A demand for change from citizens and subsequent strong policies have helped to clear the air in parts of Europe before, and can continue to do so to ensure that high pollution today does not need to be tomorrow’s fate. Micheal Greenstone Director of the Energy Politics Institute at the University of Chicago In Europe, the introduction of clean air programmes and fuel emissions standards has largely been successful in decreasing pollution. Micheal Greenstone, director of the Energy Politics Institute at the UoC said that this was evidence of Europe’s “legacy of environmental improvement”. He added that it shows current “pollution hot spots” how to achieve cleaner air. “A demand for change from citizens and subsequent strong policies have helped to clear the air in parts of Europe before, and can continue to do so to ensure that high pollution today does not need to be tomorrow’s fate.” Is our air clean enough yet? While there have been improvements in pollution levels across Europe, nearly three-quarters of the population still live in areas which don’t meet World Health Organisation guidelines for clean air . The report specifies that if countries across the continent met these strict guidelines, European life expectancy would increase by another 3 months. According to the AQLI, Poland is the country with the most polluted air in Europe. Warsaw and Łódź have the worst air quality, meaning improvements there could see their populations gain an extra 1.2 years on their expected lifespan. Coal-fired power is important to the Polish economy with nearly half of all electricity generated this way in 2018 . Recently, the government started talks to phase out the use of fossil fuels and speed up the country’s green transformation. But cuts to the EU fund to make sure that workers aren’t impacted by these changes have held up this transition as trade unions warn it could lead to social disaster. Air pollution in Poznań, Poland. Pexels Another pollution hotspot can be found in Italy’s Po Valley, the region in which the city of Milan is located. Milan is the second most populated city in the country after Rome and the fourth largest city in the EU. Although Italy is overall less polluted than the European average, improvements to air quality in the Po Valley region could see the population add 1.1 years to their life expectancy. Approaches outside Europe While Europe has come a long way since the 1990s, other countries have not fared so well. In parts of Central and West Africa, where outbreaks of diseases like malaria usually dominate headlines, the threat of air pollution “poses just as serious a health threat,” states the report. It found that air pollution reduces global life expectancy by two years. Coal consumption is also expected to triple over the next two decades in Africa which could pollute the atmosphere even more. However, Greenstone explains that the success of other areas in waging a “war on pollution” provides hope. “The good news is that there is now a track record of countries deciding to take action and succeeding in cleaning the air.” . The report points to China where three-quarters of the world’s reductions in pollution have taken place since 2013. Chinese citizens are now breathing nearly 40 per cent less polluting particulates and are expected to add two years to their lifespan because of it. “Though the threat of coronavirus is grave and deserves every bit of the attention it is receiving—perhaps more in some places—embracing the seriousness of air pollution with a similar vigor would allow billions of people around the world to lead longer and healthier lives,” said Greenstone. “The reality is, no shot in the arm will alleviate air pollution.” Related Could air pollution be affecting your menstrual cycle? ‘There is no such thing as clean coal’ UN chief Antonio Guterres warns China 'Sharp reduction' in air pollution in New York and why it is not entirely good news Go to accessibility shortcuts Share this article Comments You might also like Green News Now playing Next Trump lifts rule restricting water use to end 'war on showers' Green News Now playing Next Green shareholder activist group pauses activism over climate backlash Green News Now playing Next Study reveals widespread climate disinformation in French TV and radio Quality of life WHO average life expectancy Coal Air pollution"
"""Living in a hot climate? You could be ageing faster than you think . Extreme heat may have a bigger impact on biological ageing than smoking and drinking alcohol, research suggests.  As climate change fuels rising temperatures worldwide, a new study warns that extreme heat could be speeding up the ageing process in older adults. Seniors exposed to prolonged periods of extreme heat showed signs of increased biological ageing, according to the study published in the journal Science Advances this week. Researchers from the University of Southern California examined data from more than 3,600 people aged 56 and older across the United States, comparing their biological markers to temperature patterns in their local environments. Their findings? Those living in areas with frequent days above 32°C - classified as “Extreme Caution” or higher by the US National Weather Service - had an accelerated biological age, sometimes by more than a year. What is biological ageing and why does it matter? Unlike chronological age, which counts the years since birth, biological age reflects the wear and tear on the body at a cellular and molecular level. A higher biological age than chronological age is linked to an increased risk of disease and premature death. For the study, researchers analysed blood samples collected over a six-year period from 2010 to 2016, including from participants in hot regions such as Arizona.

Scientists then measured their ages using epigenetic clocks - tools that track changes in DNA over time - and cross-referenced the results with local heat index data, which accounts for both temperature and humidity. The results showed that those in hotter climates had faster-moving epigenetic clocks, even after accounting for lifestyle factors like exercise, smoking and alcohol consumption. The hidden dangers of heat and humidity While high temperatures alone are harmful, humidity compounds them. “It’s really about the combination of heat and humidity, particularly for older adults, because older adults don’t sweat the same way,” explains USC gerontology professor Jennifer Ailshire, a senior author of the study. “We start to lose our ability to have the skin-cooling effect that comes from that evaporation of sweat.” Related UN warns that ‘time is not on our side’ as key climate science meeting begins This key scientific finding underpins US climate action. Now Trump is being urged to ignore it In humid conditions, sweat evaporates more slowly, reducing the body’s ability to cool itself. “You have to look at both temperature and humidity to really understand your risk,” Ailshire adds. Climate change, urban heat and vulnerable populations With global temperatures on the rise, the findings highlight the urgent need to protect vulnerable populations - particularly seniors - from heat-related health risks. According to the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), 2024 was the warmest year on record, about 1.6°C above pre-industrial level. Heatwaves are also becoming more frequent and severe. Previous research has linked extreme heat to cardiovascular stress , kidney problems and even cognitive decline. WHO estimates that heat kills more than 175,000 Europeans each year, and without intervention, climate change could lead to 2.3 million additional deaths across Europe by 2099.  Related Trump administration will try to revoke $20 billion in funding for climate projects Climate risk: Which European countries have been hit the hardest by extreme weather events? As this latest study suggests, the risks for older populations could be even greater than previously understood. “If everywhere is getting warmer and the population is ageing, and these people are vulnerable, then we need to get a lot smarter about  mitigation strategies,” Ailshire says. The researchers emphasised that cities could lessen the impact of extreme heat by increasing urban green space, planting more trees and designing public infrastructure with heat resilience in mind. Without such measures, rising temperatures could pose an even greater threat to the world’s ageing population in the decades to come. """
"""Heat-related deaths are on the rise in Europe as the effects of climate crisis take hold |  Experts say governments across Europe need to make sure their healthcare systems and infrastructures are adapting to cope with drastic climatic change.  Scientists are urging European governments to take action as climate change takes hold, increasing heat-related deaths across the continent. Europe is the fastest-warming continent with temperatures rising roughly twice the global average, according to recently published reports from the World Meteorological Organisation and the EU's climate agency Copernicus. A group of public health experts and statisticians from institutions across Europe have created models to analyse how temperature extremes can change the risk of mortality based on the effects of climate change over the past two decades. Related Scientists think the way humans have evolved may be preventing us from solving climate change Heat-related deaths are estimated to have risen across most of Europe, according to the recently published Lancet Countdown report led by the Barcelona Supercomputing Centre in Spain. ""We're using statistical approaches to understand how temperature extremes can change the risk of mortality but this is not due only to mortality, it also depends on many other factors, such as underlying conditions, age, sex, socioeconomic conditions, the ability to adapt to extreme heat, for example, if there's access to air conditioning, cooling, if there are health facilities available to help prevent heat-related deaths,"" said Rachel Lowe, the Director of Lancet Countdown in Europe. The report says deaths on average have increased by 17 for every 100,000 people living in the region between 2013 and 2022 compared with the previous ten-year period from 2003 to 2012. ""In the last few decades, we've seen unprecedented temperatures, record-breaking temperatures, prolonged heatwaves and this has been linked to an increase in temperature-related mortality that would not have been observed if the temperatures had not been changing at the rate they have been doing over the last few decades,"" said Lowe. Related Climate change is making over 200 diseases worse and our immune systems weaker, study finds Climate change leading to food insecurity and mosquito-borne illness According to Lowe, access to healthcare and being able to afford a good diet come into play along with chronic illnesses in poorer populations. Poor harvests across Europe mean food insecurity for people who are less able to afford a healthy diet. Heat-related mortality is a particular problem given Europe’s ageing population as well, Lowe says. We're seeing increases in the suitability for this  mosquito in large parts of Europe particularly in southern Europe, but, spreading further north. Rachel Lowe Director, Lancet Countdown in Europe ""Elderly populations who may not have access to cooling systems who are exposed to extreme heat within the home, who may not be able to take measures to protect themselves and hydrate themselves can also be a risk. It also depends on many other co-morbidities, underlying risk factors, for example,"" she added. While Southern Europe bears the greatest burden of poor health from heat stresses, experts warn the problems are also creeping northward . ""For example, in the case of leishmaniasis, we're seeing a northward shift of the area of Europe which is now suitable for the transmission of leishmaniasis,"" said Lowe. ""We're also seeing particularly in northern Europe increases in the length of the transmission season, suitable for ticks and in the case of mosquito-borne disease, particularly the mosquitoes, the Aedes albopictus mosquitos that can transmit dengue, Zika, and chikungunya, we're seeing increases in the suitability for this mosquito in large parts of Europe particularly in southern Europe, but, spreading further north,” Lowe added. Related Extreme heat: How high temperatures affect the human body In the Lancet report, researchers say governments across Europe need to ensure their health systems and infrastructures are adapting to cope with the climatic changes , particularly when it comes to diseases that could become established.  It says many countries ""remain major contributors to greenhouse gas emissions, and are still providing net subsidies for fossil fuels - despite their health harms"". ""It's only a matter of time before the climate conditions become more suitable across large parts of Europe and unless action is taken to improve the resilience of European societies to resist local transmission of these diseases, then we could be facing a serious problem,"" Lowe said.

"""Climate change could cause millions more temperature-related deaths in Europe by 2099, study says |  A new study debunked theories climate change could be ‘beneficial’ for temperature-related deaths as Europe warms.  Climate change will likely cause a sharp increase in deaths from extreme heat, substantially outweighing any decrease in cold-related deaths across Europe. A modelling study was led by researchers from the Environment & Health Modelling (EHM) Lab at the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and published in Nature Medicine. “This study provides compelling evidence that the steep rise in heat-related deaths will far exceed any drop related to cold, resulting in a net increase in mortality across Europe,” says Professor Antonio Gasparrini, senior author of the article and lead of the EHM-Lab at LSHTM. “These results debunk proposed theories of ‘beneficial’ effects of climate change, often proposed in opposition to vital mitigation policies that should be implemented as soon as possible.” Related ‘I couldn’t bear it any more’: Crushing guilt led this Air France pilot to quit his dream job They estimate that climate change could directly result in over 2.3 million additional temperature-related deaths in 854 European cities by 2099 if carbon emissions aren’t cut. The researchers say 70 per cent of these deaths could be avoided if rapid action is taken. Which European cities will see the most temperature-related deaths? Barcelona is projected to see the highest temperature-related death toll by the end of the century at 246,082. It is followed by two Italian cities: Rome with a projected 147,738 deaths and Naples with 147,248. Fourth on the list is another Spanish city Madrid (129,716) and then yet another Italian city in fifth, Milan (110,131). Athens with a projected 87,523 deaths comes next followed by Valencia (67,519), Marseille (51,306), Bucharest (47,468) and Genoa (36,338) to round out the 10 worst-affected cities.

Still, many smaller cities in Malta, Spain and Italy are also likely to be badly affected. Tourists with an umbrella walk in front of the Parthenon at the ancient Acropolis in central Athens. AP Photo/Petros Giannakouris, File Away from the Mediterranean, the impacts are expected to be less severe. Other European capitals like Paris could see a smaller, but still significant, increase in both cold and heat-related deaths. Further north in the British Isles and Scandinavia, the study shows there may be a net decrease in temperature-related deaths. Projected figures in London, for example, show a decrease of 27,455 by the end of the century. However, the researchers point out that this drop is massively outweighed by increases in the rest of Europe, resulting in 2.3 million additional temperature-related deaths across the continent. ""Previous estimates based on historical data have suggested that for every heat-related death, there are roughly 10 cold-related deaths (in Europe),"" explains Gary Konstantinoudis, an Imperial Research College Fellow at the MRC Centre for Environment and Health who wasn't involved in the study. ""This raises important questions about the net impact of temperature changes due to anthropogenic climate change. ADVERTISEMENT ""This new study underscores a crucial point: without any mitigation or adaptation to temperature, projections suggest that temperature-related deaths are likely to increase overall, with heat-related deaths surpassing cold-related ones."" Can Europe’s cities adapt to rising temperatures? Europe is warming faster than any other continent on Earth. Current climate data shows that temperatures are rising at twice the global average rate. The projected numbers are staggering but an increase in deaths isn’t the only potential issue Europe could face as it warms up. “Heat-related deaths are only one measure of the health impacts of rising temperatures. Extreme heat kills but it also causes a wide range of serious health problems ,” says Dr Madeleine Thomson, head of climate impacts and adaptation at global charitable foundation Wellcome who wasn't involved in the research.  “It has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, miscarriages and poor mental health.” Thomson adds that we’re not properly prepared for the impact this will have on our health. Cities and towns need to rapidly adapt to start dealing with rising temperatures. Changes like adding green spaces or waterways can help cool urban environments where heat gets trapped by buildings and large amounts of asphalt or concrete. Adaption alone isn’t enough, however. The study suggests that even if enormous efforts were made to adapt cities to changing temperatures this would not be enough to balance increased health risks due to exposure to heat, especially in the most vulnerable areas such as the Mediterranean region, Central Europe, and the Balkans. Related 'The future is in our hands’: Climate scientists share solutions as 2024 declared hottest on record Only significant, rapid cuts to carbon emissions were shown to reduce the number of extreme heat deaths .  “Our results stress the urgent need to aggressively pursue both climate change mitigation and adaptation to increased heat,” says Dr Pierre Masselot lead author at the EHM-Lab at the LSHTM. “This is especially critical in the Mediterranean area where, if nothing is done, consequences could be dire.” """
